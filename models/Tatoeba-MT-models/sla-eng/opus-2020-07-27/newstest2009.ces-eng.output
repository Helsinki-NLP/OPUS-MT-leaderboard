The Prague Stock Exchange went down by the end of trade
After the early sharp fall, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions with CEZ shares have reached almost half of the usual daily trade.
From the beginning of Tuesday’s trade, the Prague Stock Exchange began its Monday’s decline by almost six percent.
This time, the downturn is due to the collapse of the Wall Street stock.
In our country too, there is a reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan for the stabilisation of the financial sector there.
Stock drop in Asia
On Tuesday, the dramatic fall took place on stock exchanges in Asia, although the indices eventually erased some of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange Index wrote off almost four percent during trading, but later it erased part of the losses and reduced it to about 2.5 percent.
The Index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which monitors the movement of Chinese stock on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, and markets were closed in Shanghai.
In Sydney, stock in the stock market lost more than five percent, but eventually losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
Taiwan stock market according to the black index has dropped by 3.6 percent.
"The timing of a rescue event in the United States is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide," said the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, sets monetary policy on its own, irrespective of China's central bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
American lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to the negotiations and approve the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it is said that the impact will be felt by other countries.
The Blood Spa of American Stocks
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, which was to be spent up to $700 billion (approximately CZK 12 billion).
Lawmakers so ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks suffered a bloody bath, and the main stock indices recorded the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index dropped by nearly seven percent, and the decline to a similar extent was the last recorded in 1987.
The Index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal did not pass in the House, the index was in a free fall.
Congress retreated: U.S. government can pump $700 billion into banks
President George W. Bush's senior representatives of the US Congress and government have agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the US financial system.
To vote for him will be at the beginning of next week.
American legislators have made a breakthrough in the talks on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system of $700,000 (about 12 trillion crowns).
But it's not won yet.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed on the premises of the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the House of Barney Frank said so.
According to sources, the Senate could vote on the plan probably on Wednesday first.
According to economists, the notification that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
But then there will be "sharpness" thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms that help markets achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have solved our divergent views on what the look like a market stability package is supposed to look like," said Democratic Nancy Pelosiová for Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definite form to the government fund.
It should buy off non-market mortgage assets from financial companies, which bring financial firms to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the brink of a definitive agreement plan that will work and must be effective on the market as well.
The recovery plan needs to continue, but I think we are there," Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets, which are shrinking rapidly.
According to Nebad Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone, where Congress's decision could affect Monday's trade.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law or whether the negotiations at the last minute can be tied to any problem.
Legislators hope to be approved within the next few days.
However, there are still a number of changes to the law.
The total amount intended for system assistance is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
Congress, however, can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the programme does not fulfil its function, in succession of another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush assesses progress in the negotiations
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may re-vote its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was to obtain funding for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, whose value had failed because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, had been preserved.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
US President Bush is pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, declared that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciates "the mutual effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senator Christopher Dodd, chairman of the banking committee, said that the legislators had agreed on responsibility for the monetary programme, protection of taxpayers from losses, closure of relief, timing of financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for the director of the participating social programme and to set up a committee to oversee the fund.
He should run the finance department.
"We have worked very hard on this and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts with the help of homeowners who have problems with payment.
The government should negotiate new payments for mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly cost of debt payments and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological aid
According to the main economist Patria Finance David Mark, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"And that is because they do not know what the mechanism is and at what cost the problematic assets will be redeemed.
This will be determined by how the financial sector and government will divide the losses," Marek said this week for the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is approved now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not that important, according to Mark.
"It is much more important for the congressmen to agree this week that this plan is supported and dedicated as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement to be approved is at this moment the most important," said Marek.
Scissor match: MP3 Players against Mobiles.
We'll tell you how to choose
While almost every cell can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
It seems clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
Still, there are enough reasons for a person to get a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the way in which the future owner is used and the leases.
It's probably hard to get a top-of-the-line record player home to listen to Maxim Turbulence's latest album.
However, such music products do not exist on LP boards and there is no objective reason for this or from a qualitative point of view.
However, if they were guilty of art rock, jazz or blues in your racks, you probably dream of such a record player at least.
It's the same with music on the road, so music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
Even here there are price and qualitative categories.
For someone it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, as well as a Pink Floyd fan, it may be difficult to test headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, one of which is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also decides battery endurance.
Some top music players can do a lot more than just playing music, but what most mobiles do by accident.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, telephone and texting, they can play music and video, they both record, they have a better camera, and maybe they can navigate.
And when we take away smartphones and communicators, you'll have a little computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill, and no TV can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more mobile functions you use, the sooner the display indicator will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters in the world.
Few cell phones can play music for more than ten twelve hours, usually much less.
In this direction, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
Therefore, on cheap phones count that they will not play you for more than a few hours.
If you call here and there, get to work to make sure another charger - that's also true for more expensive devices.
In MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the worst will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation per charge.
Another problem arises when you record music on your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers will deal with the miniature memory cards that are used on their mobile phones without any reduction.
You do not need any special software for players up to exceptions (iPod).
All you have to do is fill the device with USB music from your computer.
Most mobiles and players already create their own music library by the name of an interpreter, the name of an album, a genre or a user rating.
Some devices display only the tree structure of the directory similar to the Explorer in Windows and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with the operating system).
Players are more easily served, mobiles are more capable
When selecting a particular device, take particular care with regard to battery maintenance, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output, and of course also about the comfort of control.
If the music is especially ployed to you and you listen to it every day only briefly in the tram, you need any phone that plays MP3.
Which can really almost do any cell phone.
You don't even have to watch too much of what music formats your cell phone or player can do.
MP3 will handle all and the complete majority of the music that will reach you will be in this format.
It belongs to the most extensive and besides it the vast majority of instruments will be able to perform music in the format of WMA.
AAC is less likely to occur (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also allow for e.g. online music purchase.
All you need to do is visit the operator’s relevant website (or other provider) via mobile internet and buy a song or album.
This service could already be a bad argument in itself for the acquisition of a musical mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and mostly limited to fast-rolled radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this is the way to sell music (whether through GSM, the Internet or the wireless Internet) will eventually dominate the music industry.
Most people carry cell phones around.
Whenever you get a taste to listen to something, your phone in your pocket is swung, while the MP3 player is lying forgotten at home.
However, it still matters whether you always carry headphones or at least wire handsfree with you.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every mobile but only a minimum MP3 player.
Perhaps the greatest advantage of music mobiles will be at many prices.
The cheapest are normally below 3,000.
In three and four thousand crowns, you will already have a very decent walkman.
Most of you, however, will be limited to the absence of an exit to normal headphones.
The best and the most sophisticated phones on the technical site even with 3.5 mm shell for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of players is, among other things, easy service.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can really control everyone.
Minimum functions, similarity of control with an earlier ordinary tape recorder or perhaps a turntable is obvious.
It does not threaten collisions in the form of a mistaken mobile internet and then a huge account for data transfer.
Where to reach the device
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have slots for replacement memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant card you will fit into two thousand crowns.
But beware.
For basic models only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the dearest will deal with 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, touch Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to your capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not need to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding audiences, you better reach out to specialized mobiles - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungy).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the service is so close to a separate MP3 player.
It is now in Sony Ericsson, whose walkman mobiles have the same user interface as individually sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a battery maintenance (every 15 hours, up to 35 hours) will take you from the above-mentioned MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here - a virtual operator that would make the classics lose weight.
Maybe it won't be long.
About the fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe, we have written many times on Mobil.cz.
Finally, the Czech Republic confirmed this, which noted that the SMS price is higher for us than for the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming fees, there may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to get into a fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, but we have three mobile networks and a penetration of over 100 percent.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to say that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this connection, the president of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who said several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It's probably true that the classic operator with his own network probably doesn't have too many chances anymore (otherwise, he'd probably be looking for the frequency already).
But there is one other possibility - a virtual operator.
The entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has just resulted in a significant reduction in prices, which classical operators had to respond to.
Even before the entry of the stamps such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar voices on the market in the United Kingdom.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we do not have to go too far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the launch of virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to obtain more than 100,000 customers and became the fifth largest operator there.
There is a Penta financial group behind Mobilking, which owns U:phone in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order for them to function effectively, they need much less customers than a classical operator.
They do not carry relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile as low-cost operators - offering cheap calls and SMS, which is often balanced by a narrower offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move and a bet on an unsuspecting target group.
This operator is specifically targeting men.
"The right guys choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if a concept like Poland could catch up with us.
Vodafone spokeswoman Miroslav Čepický doubts about this: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services."
In the Czech Republic without a chance, mobile operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there is any virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations do not look too promising in the Czech Republic.
There is more likely to be a start-up of Mobilking in other countries of our region," she said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
It indirectly confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to do so.
Rather, he tries to make sure that no potential competitor does not arise.
For a longer time, the GTS Novera group has not been involved in the launch of a virtual mobile operator, which would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the business customers field.
"We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only solid but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this option with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have already made progress in the negotiations," said the press spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe he's flashing for better times.
Unofficial information suggests that we should wait for the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
For the time being, however, its origin is accompanied by an impenetrable castle of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a full virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far we have not been addressed by any entity with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sršenj of Telefónika O2 said in his statement.cz
Other operators also appeal to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobilu printer Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with O2: "We have not yet recorded any viable and mutually advantageous business project on which to build further."
And he goes, "In the T-Mobile network, it's hard for a virtual operator to show up by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table to consider in this short horizon."
Vodafone denies its attention rather to meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepicý says: "We are open to dealing with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider most beneficial in terms of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The process of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, leading to a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
Why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when it comes to operators, they can pull one rope, they also testify to the pull of the U:phone.
Probably the greatest pressure towards the Czech Republic went at the time of the creation of U:phone from T-Mobile.
The publicly available information from the Czech Republic’s website shows this.
But now U:phone fits as an argument why a virtual operator is not allowed.
Martina Kemr said: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another player would impose high demands on him and especially on his services."
In view of this approach, however, mobile operators are directly imperceptible to the total lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities.
It is not just the attitude of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately has not been in the Czech Republic - unlike the United Kingdom and other developed countries - that it has no power to intervene in competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
But he took his typical stand on the whole issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, since the offer of potential candidates was probably not sufficiently interesting for classical operators," said Kristian Chalupa of the ÚHS External Relations Committee in response to our question.
From the representatives of the operators, it is not likely that the comments formulated in this way will surprise them.
It is more than a balanced one from the authority to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses its position on the market.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "Extra where virtual operators normally operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services."
However, pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and price decline are obviously not part of the interests of ÚOHS.
In fact, the whole case is shockingly saddened by the three mobile operators that result from their reactions.
The question is, if it's really just coincidence, it's all on its own.
As with the exact price of gasoline in pumping stations, it is certainly only part of a coincidence and a hard competitive struggle.
"The court found no signs of anti-competitive action in this matter, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position and therefore does not have a corresponding increased responsibility for their market negotiations.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are most likely to meet the telecom regulator," Chapup said in his statement.
Interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the OCTs, according to which telecommunications are the single market from the point of view of competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - the creation of a virtual operator always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - has quite logically - on his network monopoly.
So it has to be dominant in a certain segment.
Even if we did not accept this argument, it should be at least warning to the ÚHS that the three mobile operators are doing significantly the same.
However, the complaints of a number of interested parties (including those mentioned by GTS Novera) show that they face very similar obstacles in dealing with all operators.
The weighting of responsibilities on the C.T.U. is a rather common trick in telecommunications, which ÚOHS gives away from the whole matter.
We've met him in a number of similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendment of the Telecommunication Law extending the competence of the Czech Republic to compete in telecommunications has failed to enforce, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
The ÚOHS must know more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
That's what happens when no one's looking.
However, the operation of some pseudo-rural operators, which exist in Czech mobile networks, remains undetected.
They are companies issuing their own mobile phone prices, which are only partially public.
It's usually a multilevel marketing company.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The prices of these companies usually come only to the chosen ones.
The magic is that the company is performing against the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant customer then gets special prices (and more) offers.
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resales.
"If there are cases you are talking about, it could be a breach of the terms of the contract which we would deal with and might result in the termination of cooperation with the company concerned," Martin Kemr answered our question about this problem.
However, it is unlikely that a similar activity towards responsible people from mobile operators could have been achieved.
In particular, in the case of three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators can resist this procedure.
Because of the activities of these companies, they have negligible profits and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the possible problems: "The law of similar speculation allows, however, the services of these companies use only a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not run in their name, so they cannot have it fully available as regular customers of mobile operators."
But that should be at least weird.
In addition, another question for ÚOHS is being opened.
If mobile operators close their eyes above similar procedures, why block the creation of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has a relatively strong power to reveal such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the operator's explanation that they have no idea of such activities and their business conditions prohibit it.
When We Won't Be Dearest
As it has fallen several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought noticeable price decreases for services.
In virtually all countries where virtual operators originated, classical operators tried to defend their emergence more or less.
Jimi's arguments used were practically identical - too small, perhaps too saturated market, problems with the quality of services etc.
In developed countries, however, it is in these moments that regulators have intervened to protect, not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created and that more were packed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole case like a hot potato.
We cannot escape the impression from our experience that a lack of clarity in the competences in these cases is more than appropriate.
But let's not throw flint in the grain.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator is really soon to appear in our country, the Czech mobile market may move again.
If one of the operators admits the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will only be difficult for the OOHS to remain inflexible to reject (discrimination) other applicants.
And maybe we'll stop calling the train instead of in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four new versions of the Czech state anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented new recordings of the state anthem on the occasion of the Czech State Day.
Hymnu has recently recorded the orchestra of the National Theatre under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlávka.
There are four versions - with male or female solos, in the congregation’s application and instrumental text.
Kateřina Priestess and Adam Plachettka were captured by the singing.
The editors of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On iHNed.cz server, you can listen to all four versions.
The White House considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymens.
He had previously said to the Czech Radio that he had deliberately chosen singers with young representative voices, which are significant and popular, to sing solo variants.
"From the beginning I have tried with both and then also with the congregation to make sure that they have a clear diction to understand the text well to be suspicious," he said.
The Czech National Anthem next year celebrates 175th anniversary.
The Song Where my home sounded for the first time in 1834 on the boards of the Stavov Theatre in the original Czech game Fidlovak Josef Cayetana Tyl complemented by the music of Františka Skroupa.
She gained popularity, and people spontaneously took her as their own.
The first slore of the song then became a natural part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of the Czech Republic.
What's the "new" anthem sound like?
The Prague MHD is tied to the chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be registered in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket will enter the metro, tram and bus.
At this point, he can get about a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Travelers can buy a 30-day and 90-day coupon (it will pay from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have to record their chip card in the infocenters and workplaces of the Transport Company in the metro stations Museum, Bridges, Railway Stations Holešovice, Angel, Rostyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Paradise Garden, Kacherov and Luka.
Coupons can also be purchased on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz from yesterday.
In the afternoon, over four hundred customers took advantage of the service.
Those who make use of the Internet store can definitely forget about the distribution windows at metro stations where they had to stand regularly in long fronts for paper tickets.
The customer buys it over the Internet and they get it on the Opencard card in one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"In these places there is a passenger compartment with a trained service, which will help the interested parties with their online purchase and also record the purchased coupon on their card," said project spokeswoman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries you will be able to record electronic vouchers on Opencard also in self-service machines, which are installed in several metro vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminding of ticket markers, and travelers may already have noticed them in the metro stations Rostyly, Budějovicka, I. P. Pavlova, Florence and Vltavská.
"Now there are five of them in town, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," said Careful.
The coupon checks the machine driver's position
The operation of machines that start working tomorrow is simple.
Just put an Opencard chip card in them and the previously paid coupon will be recorded on it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow pay not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
Then, in suburban trains and bus lines with between 300 and 499, the main inhabitants of central Bohemian municipalities drive to the capital.
"In trains included in Prague integrated transport, guides are equipped with card readers, which determine the time and zone validity of coupons," explained the control of the tickets Filip Drápal from Ropid, which consists of the timetables of Prague public transport.
The suburban buses have card readers built in a box office by the driver.
It is therefore necessary to show the driver not only the chip card when boarding, but also the need to attach Opencard to the designated place on the side of the cash register.
By doing so, the driver checks the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If passengers need to verify the validity of recorded coupons, nothing is easier than to ask drivers for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not travel by suburban buses and will not remember when their voucher expires may go back to self-service machines where coupons are recorded.
Here information about the validity of their documents is displayed on the display of the apparatus.
The referee wanted a U.S. referendum.
The German judiciary in 1945 requested the integration of the Forest into the United States.
This comes from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, allegedly in 1945, some groups of Sudanese Germans turned to the President of the United States.
This comes, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemia Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov demand in a letter from the American President that he do not allow the return of the "sumavian parish" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the monk's agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation correctly and we want to be really sure of the words that American troops are coming to German territory, not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says a letter signed with the words "People who are in the fate of the Shumawa on the heart".
Because of the connection to Czechoslovakia, it gives allegedly to the Soviet Germans - with knowledge of the Czech national nature - hope only of brutality, indifference, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter from the American President to take over the protectorate for the present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of the quarter of the population, you would admit this territory to a foreign country that oppresses and turns down minorities and nothing, you have done nothing to win the Alliance," the letter reads.
The reason why authors cannot sign is reportedly fear of the vengefulness of "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States allegedly doubted the thinking of the Norwegian Germans, it would be sufficient for him to hold a referendum in the parish of Guru on whether its inhabitants wanted to become a part of the United States or live under the auspices of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a bit naive in today’s history of war, according to some of the memorials, it is fitting to correct the expectations of the Soviet Germans at that time.
Although the Czech Germans had to know at least that they would be moving away from the Republic, few of them even allowed themselves to do so.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Judges.
Others believed they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was in war like a Buddhist German stationed for the Baltic Navy.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in a prison camp in Holstynsk, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, the Czech would be useful to them," said Chalupa.
According to him, none of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia calculated that they would be removed from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think - you'll pay!
Emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive actions focused on road safety in Czech history.
Even so, it would be possible to characterise the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Rebíbík's office promises to dissuade drivers from dangerous driving behind the wheel.
A 150 million-dollar campaign will appear on TV, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
Drivers should be discouraged from speeding and drinking behind the wheel.
And remind them to fasten before they leave.
In particular, he wants to reach the conscience of young drivers, motorists, walkers, and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign also testifies to this:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on the espouse.
And then in the pool of blood is the word "pay."
It's supposed to symbolize that a person can pay for his own life in a moment's notice.
The spectators will "freak" the spots until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxian countries, where images can be commonly seen with dramatic images of victims of accidents.
He promises to reduce the accident and death on Czech roads.
Spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip for drivers
"The driver is subject to the system of sugar and whip.
Sugar for them is that when they go red, for example, it saves time.
The whip is a threat of penance or accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says hospital transport psychologist at Homolce Martin Koržan.
And that's why information campaigns are needed in print and mostly negative ads, they mean psychologists.
Less effective, he thinks, are the boards that alert drivers to danger.
"If static tables are installed warning against danger, they will likely be fused with the surrounding area soon and the drivers will not commit to it," Kořen warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The President of the Interim Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, including Predjordan, East Jerusalem and Golan, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview, which was printed Monday by the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all the territory (occupied) if not all at all," Olmert said to the daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that a possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want tractors or bulldozers to cross his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," observed Olmert in a hint of two July attacks in the city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, sacred and historic places", which lies within the Old City.
"He who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he stressed further.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke for the departure of Israel from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an irrefutable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of leaving the Golan," he noted.
"The Syrians know what they will have to give up in order to gain the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship to the (Shiatian Movement) Hizballah; they will have to give up the permanent support they provide to Hamas terrorism (Shiat Movement), Al-Qaeda and jihad (Holy War) in Iraq," the prime minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards illegal on the bus?
The law doesn't know, you can't walk on a remote bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the bus by Student Agency near the Italian Padova, the question arose as to whether stewards and passengers can travel by bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," said Minister of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that killed a 20 - year - old stewardess last week apparently caused the truck driver to cross the bus.
The girl was sitting next to the driver at the moment, in the least safe place in the car, although two other seats were reserved.
However, the bus can crash, or it can slow down rapidly, even when the stewardess is delivering coffee or newspaper.
Role plays is whether the bus according to the technical licence is equipped with stops.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit.
Further buses Student Agency has no place to stay; which Currently.cz also confirmed Radim Jančura's director.
"This is what the Ministry and I discussed, and at first the movement of passengers did not allow.
After that we called it off and we reached the point where passengers are allowed to go to the bathroom if they have their seat," he said.
The stewardess's law doesn't know.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of stewardess - no legislation solves this role.
However, there is no legal provision prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the vehicle guide; it does not define its rights and obligations," Hanzelka adds less clearly.
On the contrary, the Director of Road Traffic Traffic Operations of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes that the issue of the law is sufficiently treated.
"It depends on whether the bus in the approval is allowed to stand.
This ends," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas where the seats are standing and the maximum speed is limited, between cities with places at a higher permitted speed and remote places without stops at the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert.
Expert BESIP on transport safety Jaroslav Horín in the movement of stewards on board the bus does not see a major problem.
"During a smooth ride many dangers are not threatened, the situation can be compared to the service on airplanes.
There's not even a certain time when turbulence comes and a flight attendant can hit her head."
"But if the bus would stop very fast, of course physical laws apply.
Just like on a city bus or a tram.
The safety of stewards must be addressed by the carrier through internal regulations," he said, and he also said, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Janchura is willing to cancel
Student Agency offers stewardship services as the only bus carrier.
He's got two hundred of them.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their profession a risk.
"As soon as I get the impression that the job of stewards is risky, I will cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by passengers on board.
It would also save the cost," he says.
As a matter of interest in safety, the absence of stewards in their cars was justified by the Director of Asia Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA.
"We don't have stewardess, we've been up against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with some fatal injury," he said less than a year ago for the week.cz.
A Tragedy Has Happened
A young stewardess from Plzeňsk, who worked for the company for two years, died in an accident of a link to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned off without using the direction from the lane and blocked the bus route.
His driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but he interfered with the right front.
That it would be sold out two seats reserved for the rest of the stewardess, Jančura refuses.
"These places are not possible to book for remote connections, they are blocked."
The company's gonna sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the ortel of the court, but it expects financial compensation from the culprit.
The law's reform?
Inconspicuous
A clarification of the movement of stewards on board the bus could be made by amending the law on which the thirty-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport is working over the year.
"No concrete conclusion has been reached, however.
Buses don't even solve too much, rather point system, maximum speed on the highway and use of mobile in driving," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of stewards to be something that would significantly endanger the safety of passengers," says spokesman Hanzelka, saying that the control of bus safety is in the power of police and labour safety authorities.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The big words in a letter from the WestLB Board of Directors to the staff of this bank are not missing.
The merger of the units of this Düsseldorf monetary institution with the Frankfurt Deca-Bank will create "a central institution of a financial group of shareholders for the capital market," we will read in a letter to the public on Monday.
According to a letter to WestLB, this transaction will introduce a "capacital board" providing long-term revenue.
It is said that such a link can be a decisive impetus for further integration in the land bank sector.
Such texts are created when the board wants to demonstrate its ability to act during a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Commission, but also on the part of the Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose communication to the Government of the country in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future, is still fresh.
The connection between Deka-Bank, which customers know about for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever kind of connection, has been spoken for a longer time - even on the Frankfurt side.
At the end of August, the head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas was told that in the merger of his bank house from Mainzer Landstraße with one of the earthly banks, such as Helaba or WestLB, he sees no point.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, for which one half of the Land Bank and the other co-conspirators are responsible, has entrusted the Board with conducting discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about trading in the capital market or part of it.
However, the talks have only just begun, the financiers are concerned.
Deka-Bank, which is one of the most important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, does not speak for the first time in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed that Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba bank could be merged.
There was nothing out of this threesome after all.
Shortly after the merger plans were made public, the Hesen Land Government spoke out against the participation of Helaba Bank.
Not even the rest of the bank houses were so connected.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead acquired Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Even so, speculation about Deka-Bank’s connection with the Earth’s banks has repeatedly emerged.
In recent times, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Helaba, has expressed a negative reaction to speculation about the merger of his financial home with others.
However, it seems that independently of this, there is a belief that the convergence of different banking homes in the public sector is a necessity.
Now, after the elections to the Land Snow in Bavaria, BayernLB's connection with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to be drawn.
That's not exactly good news for Helaba.
If pressure on other mergers should increase, it gradually loses potential partners for such connections.
In the south it would play only the second violin even though the financial crisis has so far been facing significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The link with WestLB was banned at the beginning of the year by the Federal and Jurassic Banks of Hessen-Thüringen, which has a five-and-seven-percent share in Helaba.
That's what Nord LB would look like at the most.
The geostrategic considerations of this species are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how many business models of individual institutions work together.
In June Merl stated that the decisive question of what business model should be ensured by the future competitiveness of the Earth’s banks, the German Union of Co-sponsors and Jurassic Banks has not yet answered.
Everything could also end with the spread of WestLB, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
That is why the letter from the local board also mentions that it is seeking a "comprehensive solution" for the entire bank house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect the individual components to the Deka-Bank will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "week with Italy"
It's for Elena's first time, for Luca's third or fourth.
But this time Elena's gonna be his girlfriend, and I hear everything's gonna be different, she says.
Behind them, at the five-litre barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a stronger waxer and two hundred tourists at Oktoberfest prove how deep tones can give out his throat.
Elena slaps Luca first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puerto Nuova Station, will leave this evening at 23.45 the four buses marked "destinationione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival 6.30.
Three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, and only Brazilians ride on one bus.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, celebrating at night.
And so out loud, says Marco Guarda, it's nothing for Italy.
Marco, who wears a long coat with a girdle made of fur and glasses with wide silver rings, these three buses belong.
He's been going with them to Oktoberfest for five years, only this year he's had three trips.
At night there, across the day between the beer stands, at 10:30 a.m. departure back.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The road costs 75 euros, including a welcome drink of beer Kaiser, cooked precisely under the Bavarian beer purity, health insurance and German-speaking guide - Marco went to Frankfurt for a language course.
Buses run into the night, after the highway to Brennero.
Beer is not served, not yet.
The bus shuts up fast, the passengers sleep.
They're doing well, they're gonna need their strength.
It takes place in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on Highway 8 he takes one more break from Munich and many other buses with Italian license plate.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwies at 6: 00 p.m., there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has the final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all, wear a yellow hat.
On the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the door opens to the beer tent, run!" Marco calls in the morning air.
"Go!" Go and put the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in front of you to prevent, not all yellow hats on the same bench, move around the space!"
Maz costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tips.
"Show the secretaries that we behave.
Once you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third, "Tonight, exactly at half past eleven, be here again!" Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, room with beer tents.
On the way, one member of the group hangs yellow hats as stamps on trees, signs, and even on the electoral poster of a large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
As a "weekend with Italy" is known the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
Accurate data on the number of visitors are not available; there are about 50 thousand who travel across the Alps and enter beer tents, ten percent of all visitors this weekend have arrived from Italy.
The order of the monk police will strengthen seven police officers from southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which runs national statistics in which the Italians before the British (about 60 attacks) and Racuscans (approx. 80), with approximately 200 medical treatments, occupy the first place.
The tent of Hofbräu is especially popular in Italy.
Dreadless Nights for Believers Hypo Real Estate
Last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this policy has used the word "relatively" and has also involved the fact that the German banking sector will not remain a crisis development spared.
'Cause that's what happened last weekend.
Index Dax a financial house specialising in the financing of property Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive loans from a consortium of German banks amounting to several billion to protect against turbulence in markets.
A person familiar with the situation on Monday told Reuters that the said credit assistance would go up to up to EUR 35 billion.
Interest will only have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE).
They say they come from both private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of Depfa's daughter.
According to the news report, the state financier for long-term projects on which he borrowed money was extremely short-termly refinanced, which is no longer possible because of market mistrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve collapsed by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and slightly decreased its share of equity from 1.6 to 1.45%.
Regular returns and net gains from financial transactions compared to last year have fallen to zero, revenues from increased claims and from certain securities, as well as the cancellation of credit trading reserves have decreased by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only because of the higher return on compensation for the subsequent cost of the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and the reimbursement of interest in accordance with the Tax Code and the brokering of the business for the companies was the 16 % decrease on the income side still moderated.
After its privatisation in 1990, a former state financier burned himself on mortgages for traders who were then disbursed from the service portfolio and continued to be led by Aareal Bank.
Since there was too little money in conventional state funding, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing the joint projects of private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
From the value of his subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must write something off now and these write-offs will have a "basic material effect" to calculate the profit and loss of the entire group, as some have left undetermined.
The fact is, there won't be any dividends.
For 2007, it was cut by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects since the takeover of Depfa.
Stronger than other institutions depend on refinancing on the interbank market because it does not have any customer deposits.
After the collapse of the US investment bank, Lehman Brothers practically dried up the source of interbank loans two weeks ago because the banks are guarding the liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs annually for part of Depfa's credit portfolio - approximately EUR 50 billion - short-term refinancing funds.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the financial needs of the group are covered for the foreseeable time and the company is protected "before the impact of international monetary markets currently largely incapacitated".
Other sources have been heard that thanks to these funds, refinancing is ensured by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets in the foreseeable period.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Institute (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group on the market is now ensured.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank hope to do so.
But in view of the dynamics and incomprehensibility of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that credit should not be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After Sunday afternoon's bank apparently stood in front of insolvency, it can't, even though it's pre-emptive, save the passion.
The share rate fell by 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, they held on to their bonding courses.
While preferential debts have practically not moved, they lose secondary bonds more significantly.
This relates in particular to the bonds of the former daughtership of Württemberg Hypo and the logical bond with a maturity period after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds initially looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability should be understood after the marked deterioration of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which it brought into the company by taking over Depf, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the emission banks, governments and the less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to calculate the payment of securities within their maturity.
But there can also be what almost no one dares to hope at the moment - in the next 15 months, the financial crisis will be overcome.
However, in view of the reports that have been received at the same time as this partial injury, only the legitimate hope has now become a probabilities.
In particular, long-term creditors are likely to prepare a number of awake nights to decide whether or not to give up their commitments.
In the short term, investors may use the boundary line at least to create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to exchange rates later in the years for the purpose of future payment of the capital revenue tax.
Sylvana and the secret of the bento box
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltropova is introduced on the first day of high school in Taciban, the girls start to giggle: the German woman is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from the mang, and on her new exchange blog, she talks about Japan.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I had a tendency to go to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train in Tachibana High.
I had to find my own way. Luckily, I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of the Tachibana teaching has not been given as severely as we do at home in Lower Saxony.
Students will start meeting after 8 hours and 20 minutes before 9 a short session with the teacher, called 'home room'.
But before I started teaching, I should have introduced myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, not in front of class 40 students.
Since I had not yet had a school uniform, I took on an old dress of my host mother, the blouse, the blue kneecaps, and the black leather boots.
So I stood up in front of the bench and tried to put it all right: 'Sionara Wo still Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany, and I have a birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very glad that I had started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were pouting, giggling and waving, and I still heard the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my mangs.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and it means 'sweet, sweet'.
Then I quickly entered my place.
The girl smiled at me quite wide, thought it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
He was quite calm for the rest of the hour, but when the gong came in, they literally put me to sleep.
They talked to each other and giggled and asked me about the possible and impossible - yet it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
At the break, everyone packed their bens.
My host mother also made me this box for lunch - and that's something other than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and some fish in tofu pasta.
I don't usually know what I'm eating here in Japan.
Those things look special and they taste pretty new.
I'm sure everything's really good.
Well, maybe on the bacon-loaded plums, no!
Bent in Japanese schools isn't just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a handmade bento, which in this case is especially artistically modified, and hopes that the boy knows a break at lunch.
I read about it in my mango comic books.
I wonder if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
And then I always said,
'Because it just fascinates me.'
After all, I've loved reading mango for years.
And to understand these comic books and their culture better, I started learning some Japanese once.
So it was perfectly clear to me that one day I would have to come here.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Even rats have feelings
When rats or cockroaches flee from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that even many animals have feelings.
How, though, would it be possible to see if they feel the same way when they act like us?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has published the contributions of famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents the selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without proving it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else so far being able to prove it when we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have a consistent basic configuration.
However, once we begin to focus on another species and open up questions of perception or general awareness, we enter the adjacent terrain because the hardware does not match.
When the rat is in danger, it will do the same thing as many other animals: it will pretend to be dead, run away, or attack.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists suggest comparable subjective experiences.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it less difficult to transfer our subjective survival to animal survival.
However, this is because circuits linked to human consciousness almost always include a side-frontal cortex (due to its share in short-term memory and performing or control functions).
This vast area is much more developed in humans than in other primates, and other creatures seem to be missing altogether.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that a person differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could hide the linguistic essence of a person: because such a large part of his perception is associated with the language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could eliminate the animals.
But even if the knowledge of the language did not matter, it would certainly influence the language, so that animal consciousness, however constructed, would probably differ from most of our conscious states.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, neither can we measure, due to a special hardware, to analyze on the basis of our own experience, we are built to examine it in the face of major problems.
Most of my works relate to the content of conscious survival, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to examine the processes in the mind of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in short-term memory studies in primates, especially visualization.
But this approach, devoted to Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses on neural correlatations of consciousness rather than on causal mechanisms: they can both be identical, but perhaps they are not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the non-frontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
What's in it for feelings?
I am extracting them from the fact that an emotional system such as a fear system is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
What we refer to as "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system localized in the brain (or its consequences such as physical reactions) uses operational memory.
From this point of view, feelings are closely associated with those areas of the cortex that are marked by primates, especially humans.
In conjunction with linguistic nature, there is a gentle distance between perception, because words and grammar can distinguish and categorize states so that we can add them to others.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio feels that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the areas of cortex and brain stems from physical feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, which, however, concentrates more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can easily participate in the feelings felt by several species.
I can't theoretically resist it, but I find it impossible to prove it.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us in rats and humans as fear is probably the same: But how is it possible to verify, says Pankseep, whether rats and humans feel the same way when they behave similarly?
The Kraut flees from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, a similarity of conduct cannot simply prove the conformity of living.
It is true that neural comparison moves us further: rats and humans have similar brain stems, opposite the cockroach or the brain.
But is the brain tribe responsible for feelings?
And even if it was possible to prove it in a person: how would we want to prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are probably fundamentally different from those of ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and on language), I study emotional behavior rather than the emotional perception of rats.
In this case, however, we can look forward to progress at a neural level if we measure the same for rats and humans.
Like rats, I don't examine language and consciousness, I don't examine feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It's possible to view it as short-sighted, but I'd rather move forward than repeatedly throw myself against the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President of UEFA Platini: Charity Rate for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that preparations will soon be run directly by the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise ME together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"But for our country it is not amnesty.
Work has just begun, and there is much more to do in both countries."
In the early implementation of the time plan for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are limping.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will decrease from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work as quickly as possible now," said the president of the Ukrainian union Grigory Surkis.
"The UEFA will be watching us all the time."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
Following numerous scandals the National Olympic Committee was called off and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlock.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Mirosław Drewiecký.
He said there is "a serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki Polish press agency PAP.
"President Michel Platini has been assured by letter that this step will not be followed by preparations for ME 2012."
Several teams from the first league were sentenced to forced descent only in the past season, and the beginning of the league had to be moved quickly.
The rebel Dennis Quaid returns strike
She wanted to make a commercial for a new movie, talked in a private conversation - and now she has problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her ex-Denis Quaid as a barrister of marriage.
He's angry and he's giving back the punch.
The late war of roses at the ex-marriage of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after divorce, these two Hollywood actors are fighting an unsavory dispute - in front of the public.
Meg Ryan spoke to the American magazine InStyle for the first time last week for reasons of breaking up her marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she didn't find out about the extent of the fraud until after the divorce.
For this mental stripper, the PR job of Ryan for her new film "The Women" tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was significant: "It's crazy," said four-and-a-half-year-old actor of the New York Daily News, "Meg repeatedly chews on the history of our relationship and adjusts it."
In addition, it is "politing worthy" that the common 16-year-old son of Jack again "publicly resembles the pain and radical changes that divorce is for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became a twin father.

Flight prices and hotels are down
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights according to one current study were even cheaper by up to 50 percent.
Years and accommodation in hotels have again been reduced - this is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial service provider.
The company analysed its data on the reservations made in the first half of 2008 and, following the price rise in the first quarter, found their significant decline in the second quarter.
After several years of prices on the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already been reduced.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities monitored by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already lower by 3.6 percent than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend was in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
The reason for this trend is that American Express considers a weak dollar course that caused the "descent taste of American tourists to travel".
Financial centres were also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial centres, such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent and even recorded a European record.
Flight prices also showed a trend in the first quarter:
Because of the exposure to kerosene, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, even 29.2 per cent of long distance fuel.
Between April and June, the prices of flights in the Economy class fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but in the Business and First Class classes, changes in knowledge were less significant.
In Germany, prices have dropped even more significantly than in other European countries:
Between January and March, 11.9 percent, 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
At German national years, according to the study cited, prices even fell by half.
One reason for this price drop is the slowing economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure because of the Open Skies agreement that liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe.
Noting the tense situation is the disruption of non-profit lines by air carriers, as well as the high number of airlines that launched the competition in the first half of 2008 - it was only 24 airlines in Europe.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV reaches the head of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to assemble a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - enlarge Unfavorable landing for representative Marko Marina.
This Gladbach player got involved late in the game and failed to succeed with a blowtorch on the stick.
His report was precisely formulated and delivered convincingly from his mouth.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the cabins of the Hamburg arena.
It wasn't much in the catacombs, the half-time break ended, and most people sat back in their seats.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and enjoys greater respect than many momentary actors.
And so his request was also heard in the place of responsibility.
Coach Cornelius Jol's assistant stepped in and lifted his thumb at the signs of a match.
Cornelius is the brother of chief coach Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order probably sounded similar: here with the second goal!
It didn't work out.
"It didn't look good here today," Marcelll Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would've wished it were more relaxed.
For 1:0 (1:0) The Hamburgians thanked the head of Mladen Petrić (11) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbashians could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed it up.
Hamburger SV will celebrate 121 years of existence this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena, and a lively update of the video board, in which their team was introduced as prime minister.
It's gonna be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcelll Jansen.
They suspect that the ongoing table result symbolizes the incalculability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petrić and FC Bayern of Jansen - is slowly located, but can not shine yet.
"We need more affection and more drifting," said Jol.
After the defeat in the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
The first reports of the rescue package sinking caused the Dow Jones index to drop by 700 points.
That was the biggest score loss of one day in his history.
Later, Dow gained something back.
Around 8:30, he showed this most important world stock exchange barometer a five percent drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was at more than seven percent minus 1548 points.
Worst of all was in Dow at this point American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
None of the titles could be strengthened.
Goldman Sachs stock has lost almost ten percent.
Even a few days ago, the company had a stake in the majorinvestor Warren Buffett.
In the context of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called corrupt mortgage papers.
However, the entire amount should not be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the State is to receive stock lists of financial companies that could be paid in a favourable course, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Action courses in Europe fall steeply
Billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US investors does not remove doubts.
The share rate of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is highly collapsing and is downloading index Dax.
The American Dow Jones Index loses despite the planned bailout of the state financial market.
Spectacular exchange losses Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have torn the index of German shares (Dax) down to a minus.
The stock of the above-mentioned Munich real estate financier has lost more than 20 percent of its value despite the bailout of the federal government and private banks.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important limit of 6,000 points, and with a minus 3.7 percent, he recorded 5,839 points.
There were stock markets all over the world.
In New York City, business day began on Wall Street with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion rescue package would not have to be enough to revive the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent during the first hour of trading, so it's at 10 809.25 points.
The American House of Representatives is to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate could express itself on 1 October.
The other European exchanges were collected in one direction: in London, the FTSE index was first weakened by 3.2 per cent, CAC-40 lost 2.9 per cent in Paris.
In Asia, Japan’s leading Nikkei index dropped by 1.26 percent to 11,743,61 units after initial earnings.

Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years scientists have not known the advice of a mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by manoeuvre (gravitational practice).
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein would not have to be quite right.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" was flying in space.
With the guilt of fuel lines, which will soon freeze, she is now at risk of death in winter.
Among scientists, for years a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion - an anomaly of the gravitational washing machine.
Gravitational practice is an aerial maneuver of space probes, where they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of some kind of cosmic body, such as Earth.
Thanks to this, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physics trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
But what the scientist has been saying for years in this case is amazement: Flying bodies do not behave as much as one would expect under the old good gravitational law.
On the contrary, there is an irregularity in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have failed to explain this effect.
He was baptized by the anomaly of the gravitational washing machine.
Several experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attractiveness of matter by curvature of space, should not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was not wrong, and is trying to explain the anomaly of the gravitational washing machine using so-called dark matter whose presence in the universe was discovered by astronomers.
"The dark matter, which could also be located very close to the Earth, could be responsible for this anomaly," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known by space explorers for about ten years.
It is clearly a gravitational force whose effect on other cosmic bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, she is completely invisible, which means that she does not transmit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, exactly the visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, a good fifth of the total mass of the universe is this dark matter.
In Egypt, the hijacked tourists are at large
After ten days in the hands of their captors, according to a statement by the Italian Foreign Minister in Egypt, the kidnapping of tourists is once again at large.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
He said six kidnappers were killed in the pre-release shooting.
Five Germans were abducted in the south of Egypt.
I hear the ransom hearing's on the move.
The Germans are repeatedly becoming targets of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
Europe's tourists takeovers on the Sahara appear to be free.
The Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabiya, and the Italian media reported on this.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed, according to reports of the Italian television station Sky TG 24 release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages were released.
We are just checking their health status," Frattini said.
According to the Egyptian State Television, there are five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, and also eight Egyptian conductors are safe and sound.
All 19 participants in the desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The unclear remains the background of the firefight before the hostages were released: according to an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to terminate the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed with the ransom," the quoted worker said.
He said "it was only the hostage to take over," when suddenly "this surprise" came out.
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and captured two of them.
The kidnappers asked Germany for a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" citing one of the German mediators said that the release of hostages is stretching because the kidnappers fear for their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostage after paying the ransom.
Men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
Abuse of a father 'cause of suicide'
Several years of abuse by fathers led a woman to kill herself, to sound court-martialed.
After admitting eight cases of sexual harassment, seven - year - old Michael Treris of Stithians in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that his stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, was regularly united when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Treris wrote in a confession.
The court also stated that Ms. Randall had killed herself in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Treris tied her eyes together and then sexually abused her while her mother worked at the pub.
Treris and his wife divorced in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was before the court that Ms. Randall, who spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization, was pursuing a ghost of abuse that was committed twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife said in court that in 2006 Ms. Randle's friends said that she was also very devoted to surfing and cycling, that she was "emotionally dead" and that she had given up her life.
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
They think she choked on an I.G. bag.
Randle stood face to face with his stepdaughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words, "I tied her up and tied her eyes.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been terrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking a life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she hadn't done so, the matter would probably not have gotten into court at all."
"I would particularly like to highlight the consequences that Stephanie's parents have of your crime on their daughter over the years," he added.
"Obviously she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman otherwise."
The official who has lost his data will be charged
The BBC learned that the government official, who had left strictly secret documents on the train in June, would be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top secret documents on a train to Waterloo at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
Before they were handed over to the police, the documents came into the hands of the BBC.
It is the least serious offence against the said law and nothing suggests a criminal intention.
The BBC correspondent for Defence said that such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the Ministry and the Office of the Government," he said.
An employee who is not to be appointed shall be charged under Section 8.1 of the law in question, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor advised the Metropolitan Police to sue on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he had forgotten contained secret analyses of Al-Qaeda and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown place.
Corporate reserves face debt B&B
British cooperative reserves may have to deal with more than 80 million pounds after saving Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided 2,6 million clients in Bradford & Bingley 14 billion pounds to protect deposits.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative deposits.
The Director-General of the Association of Social Reserves (BSA) Adrian Coles said that he was "obscene", that the depositors and their members must pay.
The 14 billion-dollar debt will eventually be repaid by saving Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest accrued in the meantime will be paid each year to all 700 financial companies that take client deposits.
The Monetary Services Compensation Plan Fund for the BBC confirmed that all 59 cooperatives have been deposited in this issue.
It is subduing that these institutions, which have acted with discretion... now have to pay some of the accounts of those institutions that have not been so considerate.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company is to pay in proportion to the deposits it held and that the reserves are to pay about 18 % of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on debt will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the reserves will have to find 81 million pounds to pay interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Associations of Associations, told the BBC that he was convinced that it was not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions, which have acted prudently during the expansion of the housing market, now have to pay some of the accounts of those institutions that have not been so thoughtful."
According to BSA, no backup since 1945, when it appeared, has fallen.
"We will have to explore all aspects of this in the next few weeks to see what are the options to protect cooperative reserves and their members from an account that could be significant," said Cole.
The interest payable in 2009 shall cover seven months from the end of this September until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be paid for the entire year and this could be almost twice as much.
Since cooperative deposits are held by non-shareholders, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk betrays five pennies per litre
People in Jersey might have to pay more for milk.
Jersey dairy announced that since Monday it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pennies per litre.
This year, it is the second price growth, after two-pencil betrayal in February, and it comes after a research conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers are to decide for themselves whether or not they want to reflect exposure at customer prices.
Before February’s rise, the wholesale price of milk from Jersey last changed in 2002.
Bail for Bangladeshi expremier denied
The Bangladesh Court rejected the request of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasína Vajedov for bail, which means that if he returns to his country, he may be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the accusation that she had obtained blackmail from a certain entrepreneur over fifty million ($729,700) when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several charges of corruption against her.
Chálida Ziyá, a longtime political rival of Schajch Hasyna, was released earlier this month on bail.
Sheikh Hasín is due to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her side, the League of People (Awami League), has asked the local army to give her full freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she has been released on her word of honor to attend a medical procedure abroad, it is not clear, under the conditions of her release, if she remains at large when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now refer to the Supreme Court's Supreme Court ruling.
"The Supreme Court has rejected the request of Sach Hasina for bail by not needing bail when an examination is already being submitted abroad for an honest declaration," said her attorney Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the Supreme Court order."
Her lawyers claimed that she needed bail to return from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
The High Representative of the People's League said that Schajch Hasín is to return home after October 17th.
She was detained last year after the army of the provisional government took over power, but was released from prison in June so that she could go abroad for medical treatment.
Sach Hasín and Khalid Ziyá both reject the charges brought against each other.
Fear of vaccination against armour in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children did not participate in a recent flat-screen vaccination against the armour due to the violence associated with the Taliban.
The UN conducted vaccinations in six provinces last week.
However, she says that for security reasons she could not reach the children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
The UN spokesman said that despite the promises of the Taliban, he would not attack or defend thousands of vaccine workers.
BSkyB lost the ITV lawsuit
BSkyB lost a dispute regarding the review of the Commission’s decisions on competition, which ordered the company to reduce its share in the competitive broadcaster ITV.
BSkyB’s appeal tribunal ordered it to reduce its share in ITV from 17,9 % below 7,5 %.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB had a competitive fight and had a disproportionate impact on ITV.
BSkyB bought a share in 2006 in a trade that as a result prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, ITV to buy.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading announced that the acquisition of a share in BSkyB’s ITV gave rise to doubts about the independence of ITV and called on the Commission for competition to open the investigation.
The head of the consortium Virgin Sir Richard Branson, consumer organization and regulator Ofcom were all against buying.
BSKYB argued that the forced reduction of its share in ITV was unreasonable and as a disproportionate solution - mainly because BSKYB had previously said that it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into the affair of American lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
Tah came in a situation where an affair report drawn up by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticised the activities of government officials.
The report was criticised by White House officials, legislators and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by fears that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the interrogators have lied to the investigators during the investigation in order to seek justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine stated in the report: "A serious complaint, including a potential criminal act, has not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice dismissed nine U.S. attorneys in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry stated that lawyers had been released for weak performances.
However, later it turned out that the dismissal of lawyers was no worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the dismissal was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican Members and Senators, while others refused to investigate the charges of electorate fraud against the Democrats.
American lawyers investigate and prosecute in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but they must not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Minister Alberto Gonzales, got under fire and eventually resigned.
Many other representatives of the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report on the role of Gonzales in the affair was very critical, saying that he bore "primary responsibility" for the dismissal that he "abdicated" from his leading position and in the event "notably engaged".
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loafo's command will be appreciated
The rock star Meat Loaf gets one of Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who comes to the ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold prize, said he was "honored" by his recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the cover of Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
The nomination for this year is led by a group of Coldplay, which has reached a narrower selection in four categories.
Paul Rees, chief editor of Q Magazine, said, "There are some songs that stand over such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
A song written by Jim Steinman needed big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was published in Britain in 1979 as a single, and it peaked in the 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell was kept in the ladder for about nine years and sold around the world over forty million copies.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Aday - suffered health problems in recent years, was also operated on because of irregular heart rhythm after he collapsed on the stage in 2003.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscurious streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon to be sold
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other ground communications, some famous, others only useful.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
This little alley is in the East Village district and it leads north from First Street - without getting on Second Street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of 40 meters, it resembles a dusty passage rather than a traffic flow.
There are no street signs.
She's practically invisible in a regular atlas.
Nevertheless, there is an admirer’s alley.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
The Extra Place wants to expand and create a cleaner passage to shops and boutiques that are to be opened in new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say that they were abbreviated by the alley simply because it was one of the last remnants of the time the block was cultivated.
However, the City Office for Protection and Development, which has a street in its power, is not the least interested in keeping it.
At the meeting of the Land Committee of the General Community, representatives of the City Office and Avalon Bay planned a plan according to which the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the General Community 3, the Committee prefers the alternative when the streets remain in the hands of the city and requested a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The place already owns very few land, and we would like to keep Extra Place in its ownership," she said.
"There could be proposals for repair and administration, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that she wanted to take a small street up and set up seats, some of which would use a cafe, whose interest in renting space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokesman Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to repair this deserted alley and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale proposed the city.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Construction Maintenance Office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and pointed out that the task of his office was to develop assets rather than manage.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a shallow trail in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's big farm was divided into several of his children, and no one was entitled to that narrow strip of land.
The Extra Place was led by the back door of the CBGB, a punk monument that closed in 2006, and the alley is probably the most famous as the background photo on the Ramones album cover "Rocket to Russia".
"The place was amazing," says Danny Fields, manager of Ramones, who took a photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers, who write about fostering the East Village district, are opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that that piece of public property, although secret, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - almost unchanged part of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog entitled Jeremiah’s Vanishing New York (with the subtitle "The Book of Narcs: a bitter nostalgic view of the city in the process of extinction"), posted part of the story about Extra Place from the talk section of the city that appeared in The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow blind alley, dark even in the day, and bound by cutting iron doors of warehouses and sealed windows where the week-old newspaper is being chased."
Except for a few exceptions, it looked like an alley one night ago just the same.
The rat passed through the blind end of the street near the door that once led to CBGB, where the expensive clothing store is today.
There was an empty beer bottle on the walls of graffiti and next to a fresh dose of the newspaper thrown away.
A couple of passersby said Extra Place was rarely meant, but it suggested that some kind of excitement might suit him.
On the other hand, Fields said he thought that some people underestimated the impact of the street in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in places dark, wet and repulsive."
Debate of Bilinguality: Diving into English
In this edition, the focus on education will be on Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discussing the position of candidates for Bilingual Education.
Lance T. Izumi, a California academic worker and director of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Better than you think: why the middle class needs to choose schools".
Effectively speaking to the Spanish electorate is an affluent matter.
Barack Obama's educational agenda just proves it.
Obama's campaign points out that "African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to qualify than white pupils," which is true.
In order to cope with such performance differences, Obama's educational agenda specifically advocates, inter alia, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are only learning English.
However, the question on Barack Obama remains whether his commitment to herbal education, which emphasises the use of languages other than English in the class, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Let's take Sixth Street Prep, charter elementary school in Los Angeles East.
The students of this school are in the vast majority of cases of Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have come only recently, are only learning English.
Even so, in the state math tests in 2008, the highest level of amazing percentages of fourth grade students came to the top.
Almost as amazing as 90 percent of fourth - grade pupils have reached the highest level in state tests from English and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by a different method than Obama prefers.
Sixth Street emphasises control and exercise, constant assessment of abilities and access without excuses.
Next, and Obama should notice, according to Linda Michaels, Principal Sixth Street, the pedagogical approach of the school for those who are only learning English, is "complete immersion".
Diving into English highlights the almost superior use of English in teaching.
Ms. Michaels, who's against herbal education, said to me, "We've had a tremendous success with one brand-new student from Mexico -- after 12 months, you'd go into class and you wouldn't know who it is."
"It works," she said, "for us it works."
Would Obama take school as Sixth Street Prep as a model, what should other schools with large Spanish and English pupils look like?
The results achieved by the school should be made clear from the answer to this question, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Education Association is a long-standing advocate of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education are unclear on Obama's predictions of the response.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should be taught English, he recently trivialized the matter when he declared that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to erase the performance differences, he should think carefully about the educational patterns that work, before laughing and trivializing them.
Oil falls sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices on Monday fell sharply because of concerns that neither the US plan to save the financial markets would have to revive the economy.
Prices of the oil markets dropped by up to 7 percent on the New York Commodity Exchange to 99.80 dollars per barrel in the morning.
Since last Monday, prices have dropped by more than $20 a barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street as well as by two strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices dropped earlier this month to almost $90 per barrel, and again they jumped onto the wave of enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety brought the investors back on Monday, even after the presidency of Congress announced that it had reached an agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history on the weekend.
This report was overshadowed by fresh fears that the financial crisis is far away.
In the latest episode of the progressive decomposition, the government announced that the Citigroup Group would buy Wachovia Corporation’s banking division.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially affected the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the furious weekend talks that led to a plan to save the economy "are proving unable to revive the mood in the market".
As the economic situation deteriorates, commodity demand, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The outlooks for global stock markets, interest rates and exchange rates have severely impaired," analysts from Deutsche Bank wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that Commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is to the extent that the American virus spreads to the world and especially to China."
The Bank's analysts reduced their expectations for next year, as oil consumption fell due to slow economic growth and reduced their forecasts of gasoline prices by about 20% for 2009.
The wild ride in the second quarter beats the record of the team
After spending the last eight seasons in Jets' uniform more than anyone else, Shaun Ellis' defensive player thought he'd seen everything.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter, in which Jets turned the baseball game into a wonderful ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after Jets and the Arizona Cardinals settled the grim clouds above themselves with their tormented game.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranue Colees to a 12-yard touchdown sprint, which perfectly envisioned the afternoon in which their gradually developing cooperation moved a mile ahead.
Favre sent Cole in this quarter after another two touchdowns, including the one in which the Cornerback fell, and the next 10 seconds before half the match.
"It was nothing extraordinary," Favre told Cole about all his meals.
"He's a hell of a player.
We've been communicating perfectly, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Cole were throwing themselves at each other, the defense was attacking Quarterback Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a stray shot and brought him back 32 yards for a touchdown.
The safes Eric Smith type out another pass and pick it up.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best.
The Cardinals team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, they kicked Jay Feely's 20-yard goal out of the field, which got the lead 34-0.
That's the most Jets ever won in a quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when he was called to describe this madness, said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said, "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed a lot more than the third.
A lot of points fell in the short time section."
A rested Gebreselassie improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia again showed why many consider him the best remote runner at all, when on Sunday in the Berlin marathon he overcame his own world record and became the first person to run a 26.2 miles long race under two hours and four minutes.
Winning a pleasant flat track at 2:03:59 was overrun by 27 seconds his previous time 2:04:26, which took place last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, 35, created the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - overcoming the world record or at least being the master of the world at all distances from metric mile to marathon.
Last month Gebreselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing because he was afraid - from a backward perspective perhaps too scared - that polluted air irritates his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on start, 55 degrees on target - won on Sunday Gebreselassie with a brilliant average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on a longer track, the marathon record fell in the last decade more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won Berlin at 2:06:05 p.m. in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had a spasm in his calf two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The break obviously woke him up before she delayed.
"I am so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
A week ago, I started over, and I was a little in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - mainly in Kenya, the East African rival Ethiopia - because he was overly planning his races, generally avoiding the world's marathon peaks, relying on guides as if it were a race on the road, and building world records on the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's enormous running quality.
Held at the pace of four Kenyans reached the Gebreselassie half in time 1:02:04.
After the conductors fell away, two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai, and Charles Kamathi, chased Gebreselassie all the time.
A little earlier than three miles before the goal of Gebreselassie was last taken and fled to Kwambai, which then lasted second place at 2:05:36 and improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in time 2:07:48.
In the women's race ended the perfect year with the seventh fastest time of history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitínková, a relative from Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen.
Record time 2:15:25 holds Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain.
Six-year-old Mikitenko won surprisingly last spring at the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She missed Beijing games because of something described as a back injury, but she recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon, which she was running, improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race smartly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners run into a big head and then reached them about 18 1⁄2 miles later.
Ascale Tafa Magarsaová from Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kipp from Kenya ended third in time 2:25:01.
Obsceneity and obstacles to the lives of black people in a separate city
Hidden among the boisterous amusement parks of Greater Orlando, several miles from everything shiny, loud and round, lies a quiet city in which the pride and complexity of African-American life live.
Eatonville, the first completely black city that was incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "town of five lakes, three croquet playgrounds, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, supply of Quawawawa, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a lonely place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Festival of Zora! to present a gift to Hurston, the most famous female writer of Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a party, even though she made it a tourist stop by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project of the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their real feelings with a white man who "knows us so little that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, when the Montenegrin presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on race, there are many people here who are cautious about the views of strangers.
"We pay great attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of black rise and a community of almost 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is double against the national average.
It is a centre of literature, but also a shaded example of the Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that originated from American slavery.
It is not too surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and protective.
And the worry about the idea of Eatonville really started when it was Zora, which is the only way that the Hurstons are called.
She introduced her hometown through a heartful book full of murmurs like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five of the Florida Tourist Guide’s paragraphs changed the city to road number 17, which leads through the often-moved centre of Florida, to the stage of black history and human drama.
With the difference of the big drum in life and in literature, Hurston's reader introduced Joe Clark's first-eatonville mayor into the store, and then she turned to more personal places.
"On the left side of the road," she wrote, "is a white brown decorated modern national school with well-maintained courts and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, even though he can't read or write."
She also mentioned the new husband of the Dash widow and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of all sorts and anything that fits the hourly hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston Eatonville connected with self-government, but also with illiteracy, re-engagement and sex.
Apparently, this wasn't typical Fodor's publishing house.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"The day after, she said it as it was," says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls' choir, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered as a chimp who often came back after her family moved to Florida's Jacksonville.
Seven - year - old Augustus Franklin remembers that most of the time, when she landed in town, she arrived without notice in a huge Chevrolet, smoked and wore pants in a city that is still proud of decent dress.
Most people were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were mocking each other.
"People always liked to see Zora," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair in the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with the rest of the world, had forgotten.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the twentieth century, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived before.
In Eatonville, there were no more mourning rituals or great public readings.
"I think they didn't understand its meaning to the world or its link at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the Hurston Biography "Wrapped in Rainbows" published in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s.
The Orange County representatives wanted to extend the city through a five-way highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-way main road.
Orlando's hatching has already pushed interstate highway 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming from a complex historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, has ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950 ’ s, the struggle to stir hatred among the races was brought to the heart of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and things at people sitting on the side," Franklin said.
"Actually, we had a lady here who was killed by it.
They were walking out of a melon car."
In a letter from The Orlando Sentinel of 1955, Hurston questioned the highest court's demand for forced integration, and his decision in the Brown case against the Chamber of Education declared that "for my race is more offensive than glorious."
Residents now claim that the desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the young people here.
"Black children were used to hug - I remember this - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and CEO of the non-profit group Reserve the Eatonville Community.
That lasted until the teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You don't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier there," said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped to create space for many other Zory Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, ascended over prejudices with light-minded self-esteem and feelings such as "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975 Alice Walker arrived at the unmarked grave of Hurston and began to fight to revive her reputation.
Five years later, the renowned biography of Hurston from Robert E. Hemenway, who re-entered the American canon, came into the booksellers.
The highway project arrived just as the most famous daughter of Eatonville again found the light of the ramp.
The former neighbors of Hurston now considered her a savior.
To show what could become of its highway destruction, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and each January many return to celebrate.
After a few years of the freeway proposal, he withdrew.
"The five currents of the highway have risen, you would say it has blown straight away, a real civil pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd simply said, "The dawn saved Eatonville."
Victory over a highway project helped to change the image of the city.
Foreigners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started going to the church here in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and residents began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new one-story library (named of course after Hurston) was opened in 2006 on Kennedy Boulevard's re-oiled and decorated library.
Today, the Eutonville Florida anomaly remains: just six miles from downtown Orlando can sometimes act as a dead end in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Today it's 90 percent black.)
People who come to find the story and meaning of Eatonville are often treated with caution.
Allowance for most interviews is necessary to have in advance and certain things - as wall painting in the oldest eatonville church, which was painted by white people and which are depicting blacks in the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a courageous, confident teacher who likes to be full of red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston Festival increased, home pride also increased.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville the way Hurston has seen her whole race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse and equally proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and diverse like other American races and ethnics.
From Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey's voice, there is genuine love for the village when he plans to return to Eatonville after high school to work in the local government or the police that he says he would use some help.
And even younger ones, such as 11-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Cannon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they pass through here, think, 'Hm, this town is nothing against the others," Alondra Kenon said recently on Sunday after church.
"But if you really stop and look into history for a while, it's a very nice city."
We all speak fluently in New York.
Nothing's changed at first sight.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newsstands and the round TV screens on Times Square, they wouldn't realize they're standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never have guessed that in a bee’s bee’s bee, the offices above their heads each day have bankers and managers of investment funds who monopolise New York, the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
Messengers keep running metal carts along the sidewalks and transferring muffin bakers to breakfast meetings.
Hispanics still move between the towers and wear, like human mules, fifty ironed shirts hanging from the wagons on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in front of their morning bagel at street food stations, and it is still impossible to get a yellow cab on a daily day between 4 and 7 p.m.
It didn't seem at all like a crisis until, with all the talk of pessimism, I decided to start a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I was setting up this task to hide with the late afternoon siesta on my local JP Morgan Chase branch, there were about 20 people waiting in the front.
Not in front of checkout windows to pick up or save cash, but in front of the bulkhead where the older clients are ordering checkbooks, tourists are asking about the way to the Macy's mixed product shop and the new customers are setting up the accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker", came from the same reason I did.
However, they have already selected their savings from smaller banks in places they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island.
They chose money from so-called trifts (a bit similar to the building funds), money associations and those types of savings that only operate in one state and claim to care for their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks were silently bankrupt.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion asset bank, went to audition, and when the New Yorkers came home for Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, was trying to catch a 440 billion-dollar bailout.
The employees of the offices and shops, who stood in front of me and feared another collapse, moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe port and that makes most of the rescue on Wall Street.
The ordinary New Yorkers have learned fluently financially in the last week.
Some woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the failing bank, and to her stricken top executive, Dick Fuld, with such familiarity as she was gossiping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed 50-year-old home of my landlord, changed the subject of our usual conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my food supplies.
After my visit to the bank, she said to me, "I now have my savings in the money market funds.
I moved it, I won't take any chances."
Muslim graves defiled by Austrian right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Austrian right-wing side of the Free and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing side of Vlaams Belang, participates in the event presented in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 to the organization "Cities Against Islamisation".
They bear signs similar to traffic signs showing mosques crossed by a red line.
The police are accusing right-wing extremists of denouncing the Muslim cemetery in Austria of the same weekend in which extremely right-wing parties have achieved huge gains in general elections.
Over 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun, near Linz, were once badly damaged between Friday night and this morning, and the police are convinced that it was an organized event.
The culprits have resorted to some graves of Jewish symbols such as David’s star, but the detectives believe that it could have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred toward Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether this incident was connected to the choices in any way.
The speaker from the Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of desecration coming at the time of the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
In the meantime, Austria enters the circle to seek its own soul after the crash of transport in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
Both far-right parties, which won more than 30 per cent of the votes, the Free Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, conducted a vehemently anti-immigration campaign and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the president of the Free Party, who obtained over 18 per cent of the votes, protested against scarves and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to food in which the relation to Islam was perceived.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of the "European Brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and mines and argue that these are political symbols of the ongoing Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
The examinations and analyses carried out immediately after the elections that have built the extreme right to the position of the country's strongest political bloc indicate that this change was mainly caused by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter must not travel abroad
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star who was convicted of sexual abuse of children, has banned the court from travelling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that he plans to travel through France to Spain.
The Kenyan police approved this travel ban last Thursday after handing over evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for sexual abuse of children to officials.
Glitter, named Paul Gadd, did not take part in a hearing at Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
The speaking court said: "On Thursday, 25 September, Ashford's lowest criminal court asked the Kenyan police for a regulation that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not personally participate."
64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as recorded in a sex offender's register.
He has to notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He also has to hand over the scheduled date of departure to the police a week in advance.
If he failed to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
The Kent police have announced that they will not discuss the individual cases of Glitter's possible routes across the county.
The Kenyan police spokesman said, "The Kenyan police will do everything they can to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it's easier to follow someone who stays in Britain, because we have extensive systems that handle potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting Kent's people is the highest priority for the Kenyan police, and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of recorded sexual attackers so that we reduce any danger to the public to a minimum."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities didn't let him pass through passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22nd, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in western London and at the same time successfully demanded an order that imposed on him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in possession of child pornography.
The source from the interior ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, is calm and glad that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the true character, photograph the master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great flamenco masters, unrestrained from the focus on interpretation - I aim only to achieve the relaxed expression of a man or woman.
On one side, an artist.
Second of all, you're human.
Inseparable, if we skip privacy, in those moments away from the audience - then you can see a confidential gesture, a deep look caught in the air or a passionate gesture of hands that are carefree because they are not going to step up to the scene.
German Günther Bauer swaps in "Flamenco-people" theatre performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the less famous face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer assembles a unique flamenco iconography from various environments.
The exhibition, which takes place within the programme of the Moon of Flamenca (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "reflects the growing international significance of flamenco", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people, but when you look at the photographs, you will find that these are not typical images of artists on the scene.
These people portraited "on the street" are artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy... and completely capture spectators.
To capture the personality of these artists there is no need to take pictures on stage.
He carries his personality and character inside.
I was curious about the creation of a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamenco.
The "Cante de las Minas" festival started Bauer in 1997 a long way to portray flamentic singers, guitarists and dancers on board camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the selection of camera and material, resemble a classic photograph.
The application of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical base of the picture and lends it the present spirit, which is an idea that Bauer himself reflects also flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, which, however, does not cease to be surprising and evolving."
What takes away spectators is not the act of dancing, singing or playing, but the personality and character of the artist.
Looking for the moment when we meet the most substantial, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and living, it was and is a constant work presented during these days at the El Fotomate Gallery.
This selection of nearly seventy photographed artists creates famous flamenco figures, such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyosová, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco and will soon receive a book edition that will contain exhibited portraits.
The rating for portraits led Bauer two years ago to the idea of repeating the "portraits of sports veterans" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept of "Flamenco-people" is different, the photographer admits that " taking pictures of people, knowing them and having the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or only short, to enter their lives - that's my passion.
I think the picture is the most difficult genre.
A person encounters or encounters people, personalities that he never knows, or gives him only a few minutes to take pictures.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the El Fotomota Gallery on the street de la Mata 20, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he writes is "trouble"
It takes place in an environment that doesn't yet know, and tells about events for the unknown, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for 20 years and also traveled to Amazon.
The eternal favorite of Nobel Prizes for Literature was admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia festival that the project that currently employs him is "trouble", and that "everything suggests that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had any sense, I wouldn't do it, but I will, and I believe I would finish it one day," he concluded his paper at the festival of exchange of ideas, ideas and words, which he saw in the city of aqueduct around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third anniversary of the celebration of the word and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens' "Our mutant friend" - filled the theatre Juan Bravo to the last place.
With Félix Rome, who introduced him, he had a dedicated audience whose hour of time ran like water - a Peruvian man with amazing accuracy and a single dose of humor remembered how from his original "incredible adventure" from "the pleasure of a passionate reader" and from "the power to live more than I have lived" gave birth to a literary mission; as he subsists "the lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplined", carefully scraping text, correcting and rewriting; or how they influenced his writings by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas and what "remembreasts" are the portent foundation of his stories.
The Hispano American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out whether and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just fun, a fleeting experience" - stressed Vargas Llosa by saying that "people are acting" and "must try to turn them out of line" and called on writers to "not subject to frivolities" and "take responsibility" of their mission.
Climate causes the festival to be lost in Zaoblanc - copiers are missing
A performance with spears that closes the Pozoblanec ceremony was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement by the effect that the surface of the square is not in good condition was confirmed.
That is why, together with Fermín Bohorquez, Pable Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernandez, the company decided to cancel the bullfights.
The adverse weather conditions of this festival have been plagued for a long time, and two of the three celebrations could not be realized.
On Saturday, the rain made it impossible for the other bullfights to run.
During them José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to build bulls in the arena of Castilblance.
But this was the only way to celebrate on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and the reward for a dynamic and aesthetical quality performance was brought on his shoulder.
On the same day of the afternoon Alejandro Talavante exchanged two wounds I kick for greetings and one ear, which brought him an uncovered seat in the arena rather than a toreader's art.
Worse still was El Julie, who walked through the Los Llanos bullskin arena.
In the second round, the hard work, without one breath, has served out harsh criticism from the majority of the audience.
They took control of Alav in a van with two thousand kilograms of hashish
Ten minutes, five.
Ertzaintz road inspection in Armiñón (Álava).
The attendants stop two people in the van and they drive them.
The cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is not to be stopped.
According to a report by the Committee of the Interior of the Basque Government, members of the group persecuted and detained one of the persons driving in the van, a 38 - year - old man identified as A.A. J.
The detainee was charged with smuggling drugs and falsifying government documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out road checks at the N-1 in the areas where they passed the border of the Armiñon district.
They were going to stop the van for inspection, but the driver didn't follow the instructions, so he rushed up and took off.
The passengers of the car immediately began to race when the vehicle stopped at the edge a few miles away, and at that moment both passengers jumped out and fled into the forest.
The Ertzaintzaens finally caught up with one of them and confiscated 2 178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects carried, as it appeared in the inspection of the Iveco Daily delivery.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hashish packages, which were subsequently transferred to the other police departments for detailed expertise and weighing of drugs.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "painted" and disagreed with the information contained in the delivery documents, so the detained person was also charged with falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for another suspect who, as mentioned earlier, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
Detained A.A. J., 28 years old, was transferred to the police department to handle the relevant formalities before they later joined the investigation.
Heather Locklear's actress is arrested for driving under the influence of drugs.
Heather Locklear, a popular Amanda from Melrose Place, was detained this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
The Witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers as she tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito, she reported the magazine People speaking California Road Patrol.
The witness stated that around 4:30 a.m. Locklear "stretched on the gas, went forward and backwards for loud drilling and tried to get out of the parking lot - several times she crossed the sunglasses".
The Witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear moments after stopping at a nearby highway and leaving the vehicle.
This person also alerted the rescue service because "she was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, they found an actress inside a vehicle, which, in part, blocked the car.
"She looked disoriented," and that's why her members took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to undergo the test.
According to the police spokesman, the actress cooperated and excessive amounts of alcohol were eliminated, although "we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was visible to the officers at first sight".
Locklear was detained for suspected handling under the influence of a near-specific substance, and around 19:00 she was taken into custody, even though she was released several hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a hospital where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists on the Andalian Association IU to exercise its powers in Silva's case
The Head-General of IU and the Member of the Joint Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that the final decision in the case of the former Advisory Committee of Youth and Sports of the City Hall in Seville Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after being accused of negotiating for the benefit of his family, would depend on the regional association of the party.
"I am too much a federalist, it is up to the Andalian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares indicated, to which the party will have to step in relation to the former member of the Seville City Council.
However, the chief of the IU insisted that in the case of an investigation into the illegal conduct committed by Silva, "transparency" is absolutely necessary: "IU has always fought for such matters to be as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strique ethical code for all public functions".
"Beautiful Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), the epic bet of Garcia
José Luis Garci in the film "The Flower Blood" (Sangre de mayo), to which he was inspired by the Episodes of the National Past of Benita Péreze Galdós, revives the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French - it is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of about 15 million euros.
In this way, he wanted the film creator to "paint the expressivity of the characters and analysis of society", who always admired the work of famous novelism, explained today with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría during the presentation of the film in front of a large team of artists.
The May Blood with a Meters Over Two and a Half Hour will be shown in the movies this Friday, and in the future there will be more than four hours of TV Telemadrid.
As a great fan of Galdóse José Luis Garci’s literary work, he claims that he fulfilled the film’s “childish dream”, which he owes to Esperanza Aguirre, who, three years ago in Madrid’s Autonomous Province, entrusted him with the recording of the two-hundredth anniversary of Madrid’s 2nd May, he accepted the offer with the fact that it will be based on the episode of the national past.
The budget of 15 million, to which the province of Madrid fully contributed, means to Garcia's "single opportunity" to create an environment with spheres and costumes corresponding to the image of "the shivering Spain, which was wrong in the leader for whom it was going to fight - the struggle for independence led under the government of Ferdinand VII. to the collapse and backwardness of the country," he said.
But the director regrets that he cannot count on the financial support that came to the films Sad Wing (Ala Triste) or Goy's ghosts - almost double the May blood - so he could not record some scenes from the script signed by Horace Valcárcel, with which he worked almost all over his film trail.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and Empesar) works as usual - on the stage with actors with whom he usually tries before shooting and who does not choose casting because it seems "demeaning" and also believes that "in part of the career of the director is to go to theatres and cinemas and find out what is happening in the craft he deals with".
Many of the actors he chose for May's blood appear before his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larañaga, or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Garci with four nominations for Oscar, one of which received one, is the view that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the Seven Tables of the French Billiards and the last selected Blind Sunflower, does not represent the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "this will only come up".
There's no appreciation for this movie, Garcia.
"At first, you think you're working for what's gonna happen after, but then you realize that you're only working for profit, so you're willing to make one more movie," Garci explains with more than 30 years of directing careers.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual link of Seville's Dancer Tortola Valenciaová
Seville's flamenco dancer will give up other Seville dancers.
Carmen Tórtola Valenciaová, father of Catalance (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and mother of Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuelaová), was born in Triana district, and when she was three years old, she and her family moved to London.
She danced modern dances and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a life of passion, a pioneer of female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and fought for the abolition of the corset, which made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of the interwar Europe of Isabel Bayone has been enchanted.
"I wanted to work with Peppa Gamboa and she suggested this character to me - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "it's not about telling her life, it's about grasping her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of flamenco's rhythms.
So the butterfly dance evocated a guajira or a snake dance with a thong.
Her dance was meaningful and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic was also appropriate," she says.
The performance is calculated by involving two exceptional personalities: Miguel Voda, who will sing in one performance as well as in "Open Doors" (La Puerto Abiert), and with the teacher of the dance Matilde Coral, who made an exception and joined in cooperation with her former female.
"Matilde represents the elder Tortola, a mature figure.
I'm happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it's a great honor to me."
The performance also counts with the music and guitars of Jesus Torrese and Paca Arriagy, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pajara, the violin of Rafa El Viola and the cooperation of the actor Juanfri Juárez, "who is the eternal guide of this kind of artist, who are primadons with all and who are always in love with them".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who has played for his time in such distant places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, as she has usually been in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who has a huge influence at some point in time, but no one knows her today and even less appreciates her work," Bayon says.
The performance starts today at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "The New Married Diary" also closes trinals
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of "The New Wife's Day" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez closed his marriage to Zenobi in March 1916, is part of a programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalian Government for the celebration of the "Trinals of Zenobie and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organised to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their death.
"The Trinitarians of Zenobia and Juan Ramona" are heading towards the end of the new edition of this work, an international convention to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the travel exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Sun's Light" which was opened in May this year, and after the surrounding of the different Andalian provinces, it should be planned to move to New York at the time of the convention.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalus Government also ordered eight hundred copies of "The Newly Married Day" prepared by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Perez-Encis to continue spreading awareness of the personality and work of one of the world's world's greatest Andalus poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like each other that much anymore.
"Sometimes God creates perfect humans.
Paul Newman was one of them."
Those are the words of actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "No Evil Purpose" and under the arduous knowledge that Newman has left, reveals his uncomfortably abandoned vision of American cinema and America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
And that he's been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be severely ill.
Even so, he was a man to all of us.
"Sometimes what a man feels can't be expressed in any way, and I've lost a great friend now," Robert Redford said in tears, "my life and my country were better because of him."
Nobody was afraid he'd be funny or exaggerated.
The father of film and country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American confidence is at the bottom, when they desperately seek reasons for pride.
When time is rough and people are without virtue and only a handful of those who are worthy of your admiration - there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he embodied almost platonic ideals of beauty and truth.
He was the official opponent of Richard Nixon and the fighter for lost and won cases, from the drug addiction foundation based on the honor of the firstborn son who died of overdose to his own brand of homemade food and biofood.
A full treasure for a country that has made a lot of efforts to rid itself of a suicidal eating culture.
Stormwaves have flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that not one man had died, but a whole era.
Another Englishman, holder of the Oscar directed by Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was unabated at the top of his career.
A bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has flagged Newman as his greatest source of inspiration.
"This fox has put us all on a pretty high patch," notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live as alive as Paul Newman - is based on honesty and leads a serious private life away from cameras.
This is not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But luckily, people like that are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He got divorced once, and since then he's been married for 50 years with Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a burger if I had a filet at home?" he joked.
Let him be proud in heaven that there is a conflict on earth between his daughters and admirers - it is not too common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he has embodied, he was most proud of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a sacrificial philanthropist".
Imperfect Olympic Madrid races
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after the failed year of 2012, it will be possible 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we're driving the race yesterday, I say no!
He was spoken of as a perfect race, and in my judgment, he was the worst I've ever been to.
So much nonsense that if it were to be evaluated and I was a tester, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's look at it from the beginning, one by one.
Nonsense starts with picking up the race number, which makes a man have to leave early.
That doesn't seem bad to me, but when a person goes there, let them give him everything (including the chip that's supposed to prevent the overload of the track).
Oh, no.
Here one had to pick up a number first (first nonsense, go there just for that) and (after the proper front) - what a surprise! - they only had a T-shirt the size of S (second nonsense, because I need size XL).
Where do we live?
Because of the crisis, they decided to buy only a small T-shirt because it's less substance and it's cheaper?
Okay, well, these are small things compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon for the chip and the queue lasted for over 15 minutes, he still had to give up his backpack.
Over 35 minutes, there was a waiting period, which is at a race where 11,000 people are expected, something beyond comprehension.
So, as expected, the race started and we didn't put our bags down yet, and when it did, it was much worse with the pick-up.
Moreover, waiting extended for 40 minutes of rain, leading to general upheaval and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have an inflammation of the air tomorrow, and some of us like me will not show the right time to evaluate the results because of the chip they gave me, and which I suppose didn't mark the right time to start.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, this one wouldn't come after me.
And so I think we're just going to have to let the well-prepared Olympic town know.
Microsoft is looking for a reception (virtual)
At the conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft presented further developments in the new image recognition and human interaction system in a way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but capable of performing basic activities such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would be moving around the company) and hearing what he hears in the interview.
Thanks to a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptive" can find out how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
He can also sort the present according to conversational groups.
In a demonstration video, the receptionist records a third party and understands that it does not belong to the group that talks to it and that it is not a company employee.
She's asking if she's going after anyone, and she's telling her that she's going to be with her in a minute.
It's all without the blue screen of death.
That's amazing.
But of course that's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, a lot has been said about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the necessary, without the burden of commercial waste, they'd be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover as a thunderbolt when we consider that Microsoft version from version adds new features to Windows and other "extra".
A change of direction would be a worthy act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing importance, and similar software is on it.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who leaned on the theory that it was Google's first step towards a competition with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is necessary layer to understand between hardware and software.
He has the same function as your wife or your husband, if you have to say something to your mother.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth, but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms that idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more to the web browser.
The computer is turned on to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time on the Internet than we do around the windows.
What are half the applications that support the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less difficult, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and I have a little example here.
This photo was taken in one rest room for Microsoft staff in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the drinks machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your search, our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search.
Last week, by the way, the delay in Windows Mobile 7's new version was confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, let's not count until 2010.
In Microsoft, they will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more computerized.
Since Android and iPhones are already on the market, they will have to pay for their delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried him on the coast of Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in one of the lights in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond" as well as Al Pacino in the "Kmatrov" Francis Ford Coppoly, and is also part of the uniform of the mutiny gay community.
And if we want to go into the calculation of his life's roles, we can dive down to a picture of a typical muscle with a pointed mustache that lifts up the act in a nomadic circus.
Basically, it's nothing more than a typical cotton gentleman's underwear, contiguous and without sleeves.
English speakers call him 'tank', but only Fabulux Marcel of Brussels stands out above all others.
First of all, for his name - even though the people call him 'Marcel' - which has a connection with sport, because, as the legend says, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above the other quality cotton, unisex cut, distinguishing the label and (notably known) Belgian flag, which have models of the most emblematic weights as detail at the neck.
And watch out, because the Belgian company doesn't specialize in just a tank of tops.
He also makes sweatshirts colleges, vintage boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, Navy T-shirts, children's clothing, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for a comfortable underwear.
Though it's a shame they're just undergarments.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother.
The enormous image of her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Minica Cruz, a small figure, is a woman full of life.
Their new fashioned actions now take the Sisters Cruz very seriously.
It means a lot more to Monica than just letting some pretty, famous girls borrow their name.
In Paris, Mango took part in a promotional event organized by Mango in its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most important fashion prices that this Spanish company is sponsoring.
She's warm and shy, and she gets close enough to get you.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce a new collection that my sister Penélope and I proposed for Mango at this autumn-winter season, while attending the announcement of the second "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner at the Opera for Valentine's honor.
So it was a difficult but exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango, for which you are already working for the fourth season?
Me and my sister love movies from the '50s and '60s, and we drew a lot of incentives.
I also enjoy wandering around the city and watching women walk dressed, combine and layer their clothes, I do that very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but at the end of the day, everything is connected, and it has a lot of connections.
I liked my clothes a little bit, and I still wanted to go to my grandma's house, study in my aunt's closets, and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going to the desert.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I walked dressed.
You know, we dancers are based on how we are designed to feel good at our hours and exams when we look in the mirror.
And as an actress, if they give you a costume, then you'll really get into character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You were 30 recently, did she put a crisis on you?
No, no, no.
I feel better than ever, 30s amuses me.
I find that a woman is already ready, she has experience, and life enjoys less mistakes.
Biological clocks don't scare me.
I've been doing what I want since I was a kid, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course I know I'm gonna be a mother because my body is asking for it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, and I don't want to miss it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a feeling of happiness and raise him with great love.
As far as the movie is concerned, you've got a few premieres of the films you made last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to them coming to the movies.
I come from a theater world, and so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything now, and of course I can't.
I look forward to the premiere "La ultima hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
On purpose, how you'll like...
A couple of days ago, you had your premiere on a showboat by Naomi Campbell's side, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going up to the pier as a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and she invited me to London to attend a benefit show for her organization, "Women for Better Life", and the clothes we've been playing -- I chose two models from our collection for Mango -- got irritated and the benefit was handed over to this Naomi NGO.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
There's a lot of stuff going on about her, and I, as I know her, can tell you that many of them aren't true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good stuff he's involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity, but if she asks me to make a stand, I'll do it too.
For the benefit of Third World women, I'll do whatever it takes.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in the blood will have to install "alcolock"
The interior ministry requires that the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcohol-induced driving have to install in his car a system that prevents him from starting a car intoxication or if he does not breathe.
The proposal came to light in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme State Department, which states that this is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its aim is to return drivers behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to take the course of driving training.
The General Directorate for Transport (DGT) and the Technology Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate in this experience in addition to the National Authority for Transport Safety.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 % of car drivers charged with more than once intoxication will once again sit behind the wheel in this state.
Alcolock should prevent this because it is a system attached to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breathed air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if it is recorded higher than the permitted alcohol concentration.
Its price exceeds 1,000 euros and would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
The study carried out in this sense in the USA in 2007 showed that, in the case of vehicles equipped with this equipment, offences decreased by 65 % during the first year since the introduction.
In Spain, the possibility of saving 115 people every year is the result.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with this behaviour before it leads to a criminal offence.
And in order to help put it in place, as legislation can be implemented in the usual way, however, the necessary adjustment of criminal provisions requires amendment of the law.
The equipment is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles have already been installed with experience.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on the PSOE proposal (Spain's Workers' Socialist Party), in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British accuracy, at 17.40, as was the case in the program, the Spanish Air Force aircraft, which was accompanied by a prince and princess from Asturia, arrived in the presidential hangar at Benita Juárez Airport in México D. F.
The sun had just fallen, but its rays had to close their eyes with their hands so that a follow-up pair could be seen coming out of the plane.
Under the stairs was the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish prince and princess were coming to the state visit.
- Yeah, well, that's great, it's not gonna get to the airport to get people... she's out of here or anything...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, well...
However, the Mexican press well knows who the prince and princess of Asturia are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport near the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 marine soldiers ready to fire an honest saloon.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a suit of dark blue colors and princess, very redly dressed and with curly hair, has not his usual "peeptoes", apparently reported that in the D.F. there is a storm.
Before they go to the O.R. room, they smile at the photographers and pose to them.
At the door of the hotel, where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, there will be a talkative Mexican television reporter.
Best subsidized fashion price
Probably not a better place in the world to announce a fashion price than Paris and probably not a more remarkable designer and bonvivan than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards to enable international presentation of new fashion talents.
The price is subsidized by EUR 300 000.
Belgian woman Sandrina Fasoli, winner of the first year, yesterday looked at her designs in Manga's exhibition at the Housesmann Paris Boulevard, number 54, and almost wept by milk.
Of course, it is the second largest business in Europe and it has just been opened on a area of 1,335 square meters.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank the designer Valentino for taking over the jury presidency, caused us to dine too proudly in Paris' Opera Garnier.
The company Mango, the solemnly decorated presidential table, looked next to the most remarkable Chagall works.
Nati, who with a heartbroken grief over her brother's recent death, wore the clothes of the Elah brand and the jewels on which the breath was concealed, and was suspended in her son Luis - a nearly two-foot elegan - accompanied Valentina at the head of the dinner table to his honor.
Andik, Mango's boss and owner, took the pleasure of being a real gentleman and stayed with Baron Rothschild without a jacket because they were both offered by two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who arrived at the store in her own hand designed pants and shirt, and at dinner she changed into long black sexy dresses, she took a night walk around the Opera with Goya Toledo, showed us the ballet exam room, and in memory of other times she caught one of the rods and suggested the "grand plíé".
Inez Sastre showed us photos of her son on her cell phone before leaving.
On the second day of the morning we could fall in love with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man riding on a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who came to the Paris Hotel Intercontinental with his own linen and towels and requested that no scent be used in his rooms.
Stars under the starry Paris sky.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001 - counter-stress number
Not 1,000, but 1,000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and furious everyday life.
And in order for this to not be too small, they are all summarized in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30th.
The alarm rings every morning at 7 p.m. as punishment, but even worse it is to imagine yourself being absorbed in the hasty rhythm that brings present life.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is a 21st century disease.
There are, however, neither one nor two ways to combat everyday exhaustion and problems of drifting away from the world of work.
No, the number is nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott, outside the Yoghinian position, classical massages and "spa" therapy on the pages of her book, gathered all the "menu" options, adjusted according to the taste and time possibilities of each individual.
The Protestant book is called "1001 mode of relaxation" and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring peace to the bookstore.
If someone considers it impossible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relations, "the guide" denies this opinion.
In addition, it offers other procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you are not already experiencing adrenaline in your veins, which is regenerating balance in your body, and stress becomes a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off, and focus on reading.
Speaking From Sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they're asleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may scare you, but in fact it's meaningless.
It's a harmless sleep disorder called somniloquie.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure they didn't tell one of you that he was sleeping at night.
This phenomenon may occur very sporadically (for example once in a life of high fever), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There's not just one reason why she'd go on.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, enuresis nocturnal (night care) or sleepwalking, but it does not have to be that way.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stress or moody situations.
In any case, it's a little bit of a researched phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say the individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases of extreme force, it would be appropriate for a child to observe and consult with an expert to find out if he has a problem that causes him great anxiety and thus manifests himself.
We said it was a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example if it is associated with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do so by remembering a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Trying not to upset the child too much before he goes to sleep.
So look for peaceful games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or TV shows.
In the case of very nervous children and those who are given a job to relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them to obtain a certain inner calm.
It'll give the baby a calmer sleep.
When there's a somniloquie, try to stay calm.
Remember that it is harmless for a child and that the next day he will not remember anything.
Useful tips
Don't wake him.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you're going to interrupt his sleep.
Even when he talks, he sleeps, and then he rests.
Remember that if you think several times in a row that you are very troubled, it would be appropriate to turn to the advice or find out what causes such anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not so common), avoid being tempted to question him and draw information from him.
It won't do any good, because when she's asleep, she's not conscious so she can organize her thoughts.
Besides, you might hear what he says, but you don't know what he's thinking, so why he's saying it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you're coming up with.
Never tell your child that you can ask him his secrets at night.
Not even funny.
That's causing a lot of anxiety.
Don't worry for a second, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that takes just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally.
Illhaeustern finally found his way back to victory after a long, thin period.
Without particularly playing a big game, the jaundice have created more chances and have been able to transform one of them.
The game did not have too fast a pace during this confrontation, in which the attackers struggled.
After the first attempt of Captain Kauffmann, who shot from a distance only by hair passed the connection, began to have the Illhaeusern lightly top and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne air, Romain on a long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irritate the defense of Dannemarie.
On the other hand, the rival built a defensive wave in the middle of the field and left only agile Riahi at the top of the attack.
The beginning of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to the two chances of Dannemaria with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeustern, which Marais took care of, well placed to process the ball reflected after the previous Diebold attempt (53').
Golman Illhaeuserna, however, did not enjoy pleasure for a long time, for about twelve minutes he was forced to return to his dressing room and leave his teammates in weakness.
Dannemaria, however, was unable to recover from this and 11 from Illhaeustern, who had just withdrawn to "strengthen" the defence, no longer caused any more trouble, except for the last seconds of the match, when the ball after a great confusion flew very close to the log.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before we fly to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a ride through Brittany.
In order to face the demonstration of the strength of fishermen who severely violated the accessibility of several Breton and Normandy ports on Monday, the French President decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère to meet their representatives there.
The last appointments promised to be accepted "in a constructive spirit", and hope that "he will come with specific proposals".
The Presidential visit comes at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by the Bretton fishermen in order to take action against the sharp rise in oil prices, which reached a peak of 1,14 euros per litre on average.
According to Elysian Palace spokesman David Martinon, "the president will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in order to help their companies regain competitiveness and better ensure the conditions of employment and payment of seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to fish with insurmountability.
On Tuesday morning, they performed an operation called "crawl" (a slow-driving operation) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10km of congestion.
The recreational port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île were not interrupted.
A filter barrier was established on the Quiberon Peninsula.
Sailors demonstrated their determination on Monday when, immediately before the ports in Brest and Lorient, tyres and pallets were on fire, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the coast of the Atlantic and the Channel of La Manche, like the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the trams remained at the port, or to Le Havre, where about 20 vessels blocked the operation of commercial ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped a blockade of important refinery Total in Donges during the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until they decide to act on their own at the midterm meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the "crisis committee" is to decide how to proceed on the way forward, and on its participation in the preparatory meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the State Fisheries Department, which has not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers won't leave anything" and "they won't go to Paris", Liliana Cariou, chairman of the fisheries department in Lorient, said for example.
Fishermen from the profession who do not pay taxes on oil currently pay around 50 cents per litre, however, think that the threshold of the ship’s profitability is achieved only when oil is below 0,30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman Magnificent
The unforgettable representative of "Butch Cassidy and Kida" died as a result of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or also Sam Mendes bowed to the legend of film and to the politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer retains its 2008 supply assumptions
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is relying on 215 aircraft to be delivered this year, despite the threat of recession that is taking place above the world economy.
The fourth aircraft designer in the world, Embraer, retains his assumptions of delivery for 2008 with 215 equipment delivered, his president, Fredrik Fleury Curado, confirmed.
In the first half of the year, 97 aircraft were added by the manufacturer.
The Brazilian designer promises a lot from the Chinese market, especially with a range of aircraft from 30 to 120 seats on it.
To date, Embraer has supplied 41 instruments to Chinese clients within eight years.
According to AIG, 15 % of its assets are being transferred.
An American International Group insurer, who was given over water by the U.S. monetary authorities, thinks that more than 15% of his assets would have gone up to pay 85 billion dollars as a advance, writes the Sunday Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to examine the sale of most of its activities outside of life insurance in the international field and pension activities in the United States, specifying a diary that quotes sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to FT, the AIG Board met on Sunday evening to examine the possible conduct.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory statement from AIG.
The assets AIG intends to dispose of include its International Lease Financial Corp air leasing branch, its 59% participation in the insurance company Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its private equity portfolio, FT adds.
No final decision on these proceedings has yet been taken, FT continues.
AIG must quickly obtain cash in order to pay off the 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve Bank at the risk that the US authorities would take 80 % of its capital while grading it to the appropriate ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historic meeting of Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points to 10 365.45 points.
On September 17, 2001, on the date of the resumption of trade in terrorist attacks on 11 September, the biggest point-point decline in its history (of 684,81 points).
The Nasdaq Index with the dominant technological component has been lost, according to the definitive data after the closing of trading, 199,61 points and settled on 1,983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index has fallen by 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1,106,55 points.
Based on the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street has literally failed after the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue banks by the House of Representatives, a plan which should allow for the recovery of a bit of stability in markets.
228 votes against and 205 against the representatives refused to provide the Secretary of State to Henry Paulson with the funds he requested.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It is a bad signal sent out to the market, which sees that Congress is unable to accept a plan," Lindsey Piezza from FTN Financial believes.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added and expressed concern that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late".
"If this project is really doomed to disappear..., the staff will immediately be handed over to the Fed (American Central Bank, note red) and to other central banks to spark a crisis, which would more secure credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, head of the Global Insight economy.
And with the emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piezza said that in the United States "every new day brings down a single financial institution".
Following Friday's collapse, Washington Mutual organized the Bank's Banking Authority Wachovia's rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly turned around and demanded immediate intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are not facing "only the US crisis, but the global crisis", an analyst from FTN Financial added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The profit from the 10-year voucher fell to 3,632 % compared to 3,827 % on Friday evening, the return on 30 years to 4,161 % compared to 4,357 % the previous day.
Obama won points in the first TV duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House, the second debate followed, the task of which was to find out who of the couple John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The leadership tents of the Republicans and Democrats campaign were not surprised when they both declared their victory in the television duel, followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however decent he was, was not brilliant enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential elections, a decline in surveys.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% versus 44% for McCain), believes that democrat is the winner of the duel.
Among the undecided voters who are concerned, Obama is the winner of 39 % of those questioned, while, according to the CBS survey, 25 % is the winner of McCain's victory.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and at the same time the only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be wrong to underestimate her.
She is gifted," warned Bill Clinton, however, on the weekend.
Seventy-seven McCain systematically raised his undeniable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "naive" of his rival in the issues that formed the core of the first encounter.
"It seems that Senator Obama did not understand that..." there was repeated charges.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
In such a violent spirit, the Republican television video has been carried since yesterday.
On the other hand, Obama stressed that he was the future.
He didn't lose his head and turn out to be brief and precise.
He raised his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still did not understand, while Obama did," he said on the weekend a democratic spot, which says to the Republicans that it does not sufficiently take into account the impact of the crisis on "the ordinary American".
"Throughout the 90-minute debate John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday before 20,000 people gathered at a election meeting in North Carolina for a rainy rain.
He didn't even say words like "medium class" or "working," and the financial breakdown clearly favours Obama, whom Americans consider more capable of saving the economy at the edge of the abyss.
"Next week, a decisive reversal could take place," the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama's "economic transparency" to the one Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
For a candidate for Democrats, the current disaster is "the final verdict of the eight-year bad economic policy, as operated by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
The Illinois Senator reiterated that, despite the unexpected Wall Street jumps, he should manage to reduce the taxes of 95% of Americans, and also noted that the implementation of the country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy sources is his number one priority, together with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates cautiously avoided questions about the 700 billion-euro financial assistance plan, which was adopted by Congress last night and which is highly unpopular.
"Have you noticed that there have been elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday night immediately after closing the polls at the main square in Minsk to protest the irregularity of the elections to parliament.
Although no results have been released so far, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, demis".
Some admit that they didn't even go: "What would it be like if they did what they wanted to do with my voice anyway," says one youth.
He does not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a transition towards democracy.
Sanctions, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian sexes and the freezing of certain assets, could be abolished if the election is deemed to be pure.
It wasn't like that, according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting of votes," complained Juri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of 12 parties.
"It is about cosmetic change," stressed Alexandr Milinkievich, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections and the leading personality of the pro-European movement, "because it is important who sums up the votes, and with us it is a powerful power.
If some opposition Members enter parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
Their entry into parliament, however, may mean space on television, regional meetings and bill proposals."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to take part in the political functioning, as "a dialogue with the European Union needs to be initiated.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is in crisis and we are not reformed, we are threatened to become the protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has monitored the elections, does not declare the elections valid.
It stresses that participation seems too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"What have you noticed that some elections have taken place?" asks Social Democratic Leader Alexandr Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was no foot in the election rooms.
And there will be as many as five opposition Members in Parliament as possible, the ones who are most in compliance with the regime."
The night's silence has once again taken place in October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Interview - Blood That Is Safe Again
Héma-Quebec celebrated yesterday's tenth anniversary and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was justifiably pleased because Héma-Quebec became one of the most reliable and effective blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained confidence in the public, who was seriously shaken after a scandal with contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the state reserve of blood administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusions Committee was contaminated by the Immunity Deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and disfavor, the Canadian Government launched a public investigation in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at explaining the circumstances leading up to such a tragedy and recommending that such a disaster be no longer repeated.
While Judge Krevere went missing with the report, some provinces put in motion a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Québek, Gélinea’s committee held this role.
After Gélineau and Krever's report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Quebec, which was to operate Québec, and the Canadian blood company to supply all the provinces and both territories.
"When Hema-Quebec started his activities in 1998, only 38% of people still had confidence in the Québec blood system," Dr. Décary recalls.
"The situation was challenging.
In a systematic effort to increase the safety of blood products and work in this area, we have regained confidence in the public over the following years," he says, adding proudly that at the beginning of 2008, Héma-Quebek had already trusted almost 94 % of the Québek population.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is very fragile".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Quebec has applied the precautionary principle.
"We were then witnessing in Europe the occurrence of many cases of human disease of crazy cows, new variants of disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," says a woman who has been leading society since its founding in 1998.
"And we had no idea whether this disease could spread with blood.
We therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of Krevera and Gélineau, according to which, if we do not know this and when there is a serious disease at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, a selective measure should be taken.
Thus, in April 1999, we refused blood from people who had stayed in the United Kingdom since 1980 for more than one month.
A few years ago, it was safely proved that this disease was transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that sticking to the principle of caution made sense."
In 1999, a much more accurate technique appeared on the market to detect HIV virus: tests using nucleic acid (NAT) that allow the donor blood to reveal directly the presence of the virus itself, and not the presence of antibodies on which the tests previously used were based.
NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the deaf period that occurs between the moment of infection of the patient and the moment when our blood techniques can be detected by the first viruses, explains the specialist.
We've been able to shorten this period for less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing or finding out.
This improvement has made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
The risk of getting blood contaminated with HIV is one person out of 12 million today.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone gets HIV.
Since Héma-Quebec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products every year, it will take 24 years for the first case of transmission of HIV through the blood product.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe the blood transfusions necessary to heal," says Head of Management Héma-Quebek.
"The challenge for the next decade is to preserve the safety of our products.
We never know what disease element may appear in the system.
Just last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by stabbing insects.
It is necessary to be constantly cautious," continues Dr. Décary, stressing that in addition to safe supply, Héma-Quebec must also count on sufficient supply.
"The needs are growing because the population is getting old.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for a network of blood donors, which on average consists of only 3% Québecians eligible for donation."
Any healthy person at least 18 years of age who meets the criteria of admissibility, but can only donate blood once in 56 days, that means six times a year.
14% of the people offering blood are not on average accepted because, for example, they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited a country where mud colds are found, they are excluded for one year.
"With this 3% we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Inadequacies are very rare.
Members of the donor network, however, need to be supplemented proportionally by how old and unable to donate blood.
However, convincing people to give blood is difficult, especially to hold them back and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life today is so unrestrained that we will only find an hour to donate blood," Francine Décary said.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Quebec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eye bubbles and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before they are stored in Hema-Quebek, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Québek.
The umbilical cord, previously considered biomedical waste, results in blood rich in stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousand blood samples from the umbilical cord into the bank, and we assume that we will receive them over a thousand a year.
At the beginning of next year we should start offering them for transplants," Dr. Décary said, which describes the blood collection program from the umbilical cord as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they don't have access to it," because Hema-Quebec doesn't have the resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Québek.
Football - Impact in the Semifinal
The Impact of Montréal qualified yesterday at Saputo Stadium during the second and decisive match of the quarterfinals played for the total number of goals in the semifinal round of the first USL division, thanks to the victory 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both games) over Sonders from Seattle.
The publisher Antonio Ribeiro gave the decisive goal in the 90th minute game.
After both sides, the first half of the group was filled with the publisher David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who was able to consult Matt Jordan in favor of Sonders.
On Friday, during the first of the two games, the quarterfinals suffered an impact in the Starfire Complex in Tukville on the suburbs of Seattle defeat 2:1.
The impact will be measured in the semifinals by its forces with Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnnessoto, Thunder settled the home game deficit 3:1 and finally won the 4:3, however, Whitecaps advanced to the semifinal round with the total number of goals 5:4.
The impact should clash with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, however, details of the series of matches will be confirmed until today.
Short - Kovalev's winning goal
The first attack of Canadien is ready to start the season.
A unit composed of Alex Kovaleva, Tomáš Plekance and Andreje Kosticina last night at the Centre Bell encouraged an attack on Canadien 3:2 on separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the collision, scored a goal, Plekanec gathered two assists and Kovalev cleaned up one play in this fourth three-colored victory from six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by giving a single goal during the separate raids.
"I am not ready yet," the Russian warned.
"I need one more fight to make me feel good."
"In the first third he tried to handle too much," observed Guy Carbonnau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a great applause."
Charest bets north
Prime Minister does not rule out early elections by the end of the year
As soon as the Assembly of the Liberal Party (Parti libéral) ended, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Québek, where the new Yves Bolduc Health Minister (left) is running for election in today's supplementary elections.
"Move the border of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visibly seductive way at the end of the meeting of the Liberal Party of Québek in Lévis, without giving details.
During his talk, pictures were presented behind his back in a picture mill.
On three round canvass ran loops with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Québek from the view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Huge means, just like during the electoral period.
At the press conference, however, the Prime Minister refused to rule out early elections in autumn, even though he indicated that he had a very busy program.
The Plan of the North is the fourth dimension of "visa", which the Prime Minister intends for Québec, a vision of "new economic space", which includes an agreement with France on labour, a convention between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - Northern Territory on the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has recently mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister has limited himself to explaining why the North represents "a jewel with enormous potential", but he has not set a deadline, the level of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At the very most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further divorced: in particular water power plants, forests, but especially mining sectors, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructures.
North, according to Charest's estimate, contains "nicil, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This land is twice the size of France, it's in Québek.
And it's not just us, but it's in us," he stressed, as if he wanted to show that he was calling a certain national foundation myth.
Québec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, the prime minister erected: the pursuit of gold in Abibi, Québec engineering, James' cove.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after being theatrically silent to look at a huge map behind his back.
North, 70% of the territory of Québek, includes part of Labrador, which Québec has always been asked to specify the prime minister during the press conference.
"This is a traditional attitude that has been repeated by all previous governments.
There is one border line that has long been left out of the Convention and if there is a suitable opportunity, in the name of the government, I will take this position again," he said.
Otherwise, "there is also a need to reconsider our vision of the North in relation to climate change", he said when he spoke of the Northwest crossing, which will open year-round as a result of the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking over the territory becomes an obligation.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the original nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Québec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequistian MP from Ungawa), have already started negotiations with some thirty communities.
The Inter-Ministerial Committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important position.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be imposed".
The development of the North should, however, take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The plan of the North will be "jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visi" as a fluent follow-up to the vision of liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Just like the liberals who preceded us, we changed our minds to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the still shaken themes of the weekend, which was launched on Friday by a large cocktail of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the front of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted suggests that Beauharnois' headquarters be baptized on the Aljellard Godbout dam.
"From Godbout, which founded Hydro-Quebec, through Lesage, which carried out the Calm Revolution and the Nationalization of Water Electricity, up to the Bourass, which created James' Bay, has enabled our party to create the future," Jean Charest said.
At the press conference he responded to another authority, this time conservative, namely the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
When a row came to Eastmain1a-Ruper's power plant, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm only saying this between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his member base, giving a big applause.
The same prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and no doubt in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling elections in the autumn of this year, which allows him to do so.
However, he stressed that his programme was loaded, especially the mission of the federal council in China and the Québec-New York summit.
The weekend convention provided the leader of liberals with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "strengths to change the constitution", which were very smooth: PLQ (Liberal Party of Québek) specifically requires recognition of the "specificity of Québek" in the Constitution.
He also wishes Québec to appoint some members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Television Council who would have veto rights in the event of decisions taken in Québek.
On the opposition's side, the plan of the North was sceptically accepted in its main features.
PQ chief (Parti Québecois) Pauline Marois again pulled out the development policy of northern Québek, launched by Landry's government in 2001.
According to her, when the government of liberals came into power in 2003, it refused to comply with this policy.
If she had held onto her, "we would have been further today", Marois noted her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today) François Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in government.
"We accept, however, that it is not just a theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - Dishonored Land
It was Vic Toews, an executive of "justice" (of irony) in Harper's cabinet, who allowed himself to tell himself last summer about Louise Arbour that she represents "fang" for Canada.
To trample on a woman who fought unrelentingly for justice and who deserves all our admiration, this tells many about the prime minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that, as the only one of the participating Western countries, did not bring back to the country of its national imprisoned in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
The government, which does not at all consider that at a time when the acts that were committed to him were to take place, Omar Khadr was a juvenile adolescent.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, Canada denies its word and lets rot under the inhumane conditions of a child soldier.
The only one who relies on the parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and, in particular, the Association of Canadian Lawyers are defending the repatriation of Omar Khadra so that he can face a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes before torture: few care that this young man is psychologically destroyed next time, and no doubt it persisted after so many years of torture.
We do not realize this, but we are just witnessing the permissive erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the words that Harper is so fond of and which of his mouth sounds so empty.
The time has come when there is no more morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, mistreat him, to imprison him according to the libol of the boss of the minority government so far (how will it be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that reports Honesty, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what was the reputation and seriousness of our country.
Shame is, Mr. Toews, in this denial, not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwellian discourse by Barrick Gold
In a letter dated 17 September, Le Devoir wrote to Patrick J. Garver, the executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barick Gold.
Orwell's logic confirms that the world's largest gold producer has launched the pursuit of three authors and a poor little publishing company for an insult to honor in order to provoke a "transparent public debate" and demands six million.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of harassment for insult to honor, but the law.
It's no surprise that Garver is completely overturned by this fundamental distinction.
Or is it for Barrick Gold the best way to lead a public debate, to bring down anyone who dared to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the process takes place, authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend honorable sums to be ready to defend themselves and fight in a very uneven fight with the army of lawyers supported by almost bottomless pockets of mining society.
The tactics in these uneven fights are often based on the destruction of the defendants in order to enforce a conciliation procedure, which fills the mouth with opposition and will also put anyone who dares to commit this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had a public opinion about the whole thing.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, there is a debate in Canada under normal circumstances in exchange of ideas, not in the wound of a sneezing.
Therefore, mining companies were not enough to open their books, their documentation and to bring about a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light into the whole thing.
However, Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in public opinion, and he smudges petitions and letters in support of the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he might demand a "public debate" and at the same time disprove the public's views?
It seems that this word in the vice president's world only refers to paid lawyers, not all Canadians; it is a rather narrow concept of this concept.
In democracy, they have the right to speak to the Nazis.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public, which supports authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of mining society.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge the matter, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, not in the context of what many feel as a prosecution, in which the defendant is to be covered by a mouth (in the context of his prosecution of the "public debate" Barrick, by the way, has just given an official call to the authors of Noir Canada to officially announce that they should stop using this term...).
If we ignore Garver's surreal speech, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on university freedom of study and the search for truth that is essential to every democratic society.
It generally denies the right to quote credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations that form the very basis of intellectual activity.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that do not please rich companies of this world without exposing ourselves to repeated harassment, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted to have a public and transparent debate, she could have created it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He's entitled to an answer.
The university environment we belong to has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s exaggerated lawsuit clearly shows that despite what he claims, he does not have the slightest desire to have a transparent debate.
For the university world, it is a loss, as well as a public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures that would restrict such an unauthorized prosecution.
Operation to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
Bush's administration and congressional envoys, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue plan since the great crisis of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan, how to use $700 billion to curb the financial crisis that has been plagued by Wall Street for months, must still be approved by the two chambers of Congress.
In particular, it foresees: better control of elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the payment of saved public money, new measures to capture the number of homes seized for non-payment and the right to monitor the amount of wages paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosiová and the representative of the Republicans at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday, minutes after midnight, after the two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress and have reached an agreement that will be effective on the markets," said the representative of Bush's administration, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done so that the real economy and the ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis just taking place on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is a crucial point: if we don't do it, trauma, chaos and disruption of American daily lives will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
During the last hours, negotiations have taken place on the maximum turnout of fear of the effect that further failure should have on the deployment of investors.
The time limit set was the opening of markets this morning.
Both candidates for the US President were invited to the negotiations later, and they both expressed themselves more for the agreement, but they did not mention their dissatisfaction with the fact that it was necessary to resort to such a far-reaching solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has attached himself to the agreement on certain measures, in particular measures aimed at enabling the owners of the residence, and measures on remuneration of the heads of the state of employment of the protected companies.
"If we ask the taxpayers to take special measures for the irresponsibleness of some people, there is nothing to be congratulated for.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on television waves.
His Republican rival John McCain, who was asked by another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I would love to see the details, but I hope so."
"The rough features I've read [showing] that it's something that we're all going to have to spend and what we're going to be able to move on with.
Choosing inactivity is simply unacceptable," he said.
The goal of the 700 billion-dollar plan is to buy off suspicious claims and risk and non-sales assets of American financial institutions for taxpayers' money.
The plan comes after 14 months of the crisis developed by the crackdown on the real estate market, which initially led to the collapse of risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then moved to further, expanded forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of cash and the breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
The collapse of the first draft agreement from last week is a matter of conscience for Republican Members.
From the moment the Democrats came to the conclusion that for some "toxic" assets companies with difficulties the government will only handle, but it will not buy them, there is a belief that the no-east situation is blessed.
In an effort to bring the conflicting views of Congress closer together, a measure has been added that the government will be able to introduce new fees that would help it get its contribution back if, as a result of the programme, it will have to absorb losses for a period of five years.
The new plan is based on a first amount of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added, if the President deems it necessary.
The contribution of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in saved companies that will pay dividends in case of profit and will be able to resell when it's over.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the borrowing procedures of the loans covered by the plan, as well as to set limits on the level of valuation and compensation paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The members of the plan would like to undergo a vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, voices continued to rise against this project in both the Republican and democratic camps.
"It is absolutely obvious Washington can't hear you," Republican Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Financial Commission, reported to the voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
However, it is not the solution to make money on taxpayers."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, moderator of a group of congressmen called the "sceptical committee", presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred esteemed economic professors, among them three Nobel Prize winners, wrote: we ask Congress not to rush and scrutinise carefully which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time in Europe, it has been reaffirmed that this crisis is a global crisis.
After the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced a partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which has been at the brink of collapse since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion USD) due to the crisis of risk credits for property purchases in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, among the top 20 European banks and among the top ten insurers.
"We will not lose this money," Dutch Finance Minister Wooster Bos said yesterday.
"In return, we get voting rights in the bank and influence.
And that is exactly what the surveyors and the households of today are able to appreciate."
On the other side of the Channel La Manche, it seems, the British government has launched the birth of another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Brigley, of which more than $41 billion ($75.5 billion) were credits for the purchase of real estate.
According to his announcement yesterday, he will buy out branches and accounts of clients of the British Bank, the Spanish Bank of Santander.
Bradford and Brigley will be second bank to Northern Rock, which the British government has had to nationalize since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icons
His beauty with azur's eyes has long represented his trump, according to others, weakness.
Did this American actor escape with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity, and unrelenting talent that he possessed also separated him from the power category that produces real stars.
But what a runner he was on a long track!
Paul Newman died on Friday, 83 years old at his Connecticut ranch as a result of lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of American cinematography's fat years.
Less grand than Brando, to whom he was similar and for a long time he was some rival on the film screen, Newman was a more careful actor, certainly a fragile but also an apostle of freedom and the breakup of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and the mother of Hungary.
Of these European roots was born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
No excessive ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because it saw the whole country in love with self made mana, a warrior at the war in the Pacific, injured in a battle that at the beginning of the 1950s studied acting in Yale, then visited the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated the triumph in the theatre, in television and in turn in the film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a racing car racer, who was placed second at a 24-hour race in Le Mans in 1979, while also a sexual symbol, despite the fact that he had been a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him also go the dens of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged stars, allergic to the call of their own show-business, which will forever remain to a certain degree mysterious.
A decent man, in the most sublime sense.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend caused a twist to the movie's lovers, while his great role competes on the black screen of memories.
After him, he defies more than half a century of constantly changing American seventh art.
The memory of a charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his meaningful wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Kočka on a burning roof, adaptation of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
In the less ancient past (1990) we recall his sensitive Mr Bridge, anxious at an advanced age of marriage, who did not meet all expectations.
So many other Newman Pauls have made history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a deranged, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Someboda Up There Likes Me, a role designed for James Dean, taken after his death, which Newman gave in 1956.
Sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, Oscar for best movie in 1973.
A bitter and vindictive pool player in the amazing The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same figure in the Color of Money Martin Scorsese, bringing him the only Oscar of seven nominations in 1987.
This face traveling forever, it was him.
It's him again.
In his career, he competes with different ages.
Young people know him primarily because of the iconic Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
The fans met with him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy Brothers Coen.
He then closed his career as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several film legends that soon left the craft, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood with its gilds, manifestations and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, "to be a live challenge underplaying", judging that he pushed too much of the saw in his performance.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles were not always as tender as the tray.
However, the first lovers played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lumps and despairers whose fall and revolts reflected in his perfect features.
As director of Newman, he revealed few familiar sites of his shy sensitivity.
His 1968 film Rachel (according to the novel of the Canadian woman Margaret Laurence), in which his wife Joanne Woodward played the leading role, gives a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
His son Scott, who lost to an overdose, was dedicated in 1984 to Harry and Son, a work full of shame and shame.
In the rush of honor that came to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former comrade Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) mournfully declared: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of life, these are the main characteristics of a dead actor.
If we remember his legendary career, there is also a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, an independent film, a resistance to Hollywood's decline.
His likeness we were used to seeing on bottles of wine vinegar, sauce, biscuits, and other foods, which may have seemed rather untasting, although at first it was a gag.
However, profits from the sale went to the account of his Heavy Childhood Foundation.
Newman got involved in society until the last minute.
He left his five daughters a letter containing the following sentences: "Always and until the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here."
And it was an honor for us to be able to follow the path of life of such a bright and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the factory for the invoices Zuschlag & spol.?
Soon, on 8 October, the trial against Janos Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
In addition to other criminal offences, politicians and their associates, including document counterfeiting, are accused of fraud committed in the long term and systematically by a criminal organisation which has resulted in extremely significant damage.
According to the D.A.'s office, they used money obtained in public competitions for their own ends, and they often made fictitious invoices to fulfill their tasks.
Money from the state and government - a total of approximately 65 million forints - traveled in part to the treasury of Fiatal Balloldal, in part into the pockets of individuals.
The way in which the investigating authority also informed it was that the money obtained in public competitions had been collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real counter-assessment and the commitments accepted by the association had never been sufficient.
According to the prosecution, a large part of the invoices were fake.
Prints of these invoices came from the Józsefväros market; round stamps were made in Kiskunghalas.
On behalf of which companies the production of invoices takes place, it was decided, among other things, on the county road along the northern coast of Balaton, to which Istvan Lados János Zuschlag was sent.
According to his statement, he was first appointed to look at pensions and restaurants.
They requested accounts for their consumption, according to which the model of which was followed by invoices presented in public competitions issued by, inter alia, the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, and the Office of the City.
The invoices were mostly presented by István Lados with his associate Andras
On his "studio path" Lados looked at one of the cellars.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its associates in 2003, this catering facility was provided for the 90th group of Biztos Pont.
Of course, there are so many people who would suddenly fail to fit into this facility, according to the company manager.
In addition, she was using the formal and content errors invoices presented in the summer 2002 by a foundation called Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomia had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet a hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
However, the publishers of the rich fantasy magazines exaggerated even when they brought to the documents the company dedicated to the same hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in whose accounts, according to the information provided to the State Department, documents sounding in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppa did not or were not configured.
Győző Farkas for hvg.hu said that when he was summoned to the D.A. and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that it was fake documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were on the wrong spot."
As he added, in addition to the formalities, it was not agreed that 100 people were accommodated according to the invoice, for there are only eleven rooms that do not have that much capacity.
In addition, nutrition was also indicated on the invoice, with their restaurants not working for a long time.
The zealous manufacturers of invoices did not even see that the seen Budapest Travel Office organised only foreign travel, and the cash invoice, which also did not match the company’s invoicing practice, stated foolishly as a travel mediation service in Hungary.
Moreover, as was the case during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, although the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
On the four documents presented by the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. did not agree, among other things, on the level of VAT. The company’s activities are not covered by the 25 per cent, but only 15 per cent of VAT, and the employees of the hotel were exposed to only printed invoices, but the invoices were written by hand.
In addition, the "publishers" of the invoice was damaged by the fact that one company had indicated how the investigation of the State's office revealed, as an activity carried out by the road transport of goods, which was not carried out by the company originally based on the investment consultancy.
The fact that the invoices are issued by the Foundation Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and the associations XXI. Šázadi Kulturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false has also failed due to formal deviations - an inadequate format of invoice and an incorrect stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Kunfehertó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that the invoices would be issued by them.
For example, the counterfeiters did not notice that HIB s. r. o. from Nyíregyháza was at the time of the fact that the group from Fiatal Városért was fed to her, in liquidation, and that is why, according to our information, the liquidating commissioner of the company also denied that the paper would be issued by him.
The invoices were conscious.
The second group of invoicings are those who knew they had to exhibit a fictitious invoice.
Esély Budapest Foundation has issued accounts for about four million forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of Fiatal Balloldal - Ifjú Szocionalisták.
The head of the company Collab s. r. o. made one of the accused Ludovic Györfi to issue a fictitious account.
Zuschlag and his associates also cooperated with Biogate s. r. o, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided the Jobb Jövőért and the Atlasz and Vörösfenyő Foundation with invoices worth about five million forints for which there was no real economic activity.
Neither did the money movement, since the invoices created were later cancelled, which the organizations had already forgotten to mention in their documents.
Other groups of invoicing companies include those who had ties to the defendants.
For example, Iván Kubatov was appointed representative of the Ukrainian company Delta Trió s.r.o., which deals with fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not to be found.
The company launched several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computer technology funds worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment Ltd, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian man, who was to hand over documents concerning the company in 2002-2005 as well as Ivan Kubatov.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that, on behalf of the company, he issued invoices to the companies Atlasz, Hoppa and the Foundation Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and himself accepted their opposition.
At the request of Iván Kubatova, Romanian officials were established by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get the job.
However, the companies benefited him because, at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szentho, who also prepared their charters, he made invoices on behalf of companies of Atlasz and Y-Generacio associated with Zuschla.
In the name of company investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Cubas a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The State Department concluded that Kubatov had come to 10 percent of the amounts indicated on invoices and VAT.
In order to produce fictitious invoices, this time for Biztos Pont, a man also used Szi-Beri k. t.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarszágért submitted proposals in January 2006 to the Public Competition of the Mihálye Tancsicse Foundation (TMA), a publicly beneficial organisation of the Socialist Party.
They obtained 500 000 forints, but did not invest on the objectives set out in the proposals.
In order for this to not show, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were found in the home inspection at Árpad Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, part of the defendants will probably describe the course of the production of invoices, as they have already done on the prosecution.
It may be more interesting if he decides to reveal everything to himself the main defendant Janos Zuschlag.
His previous statement is not too detailed, and even though he has already promised a number of times that he will expose everything in an extensive way, he has not done so far.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for the large part of the damage, 50 million forints, maybe the socialists made a deal with him, and Zusi will take it upon himself.
However, he may have been offended so far, as his requests to ease the conditions of his detention, i.e. the placement in the home prison, have remained unheard of.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes, who have committed much greater harm that they have not yet done, may freely walk or at least wait for the end of the conduct of their homes, he does not have that option.
Truffle Psychology: Why are we spending more money?
In auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimating goods.
Neurological and economic foundations of this acquaintance - and seemingly irrational - have been able to reveal behavior to researchers in the field of neurology and economics of the University of New York.
According to their study, published in Science magazine, people do not want to be left behind in the eBay auction type, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
Experimental auction research attempted to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers gambled, the other group participated in the auctions, using the FMRI method to examine the active area of the brain of experimental persons.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction game, the important element of which was to switch the other side, began to work intensively in losing the whole brain-skinned, called strioatum.
This brain area plays, in addition to many other functions, a role in the "self-replicating" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, price-cutting can be explained by researchers in an effort to avoid a quick reaction to the striata.
In order to support their theory, the members of the research team carried out a series of economics of financial cross-cutting investigations.
Under different conditions, three groups were auctioned against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product is, and they made bets.
In addition, members of the next group were promised that if they get out of the game, they would get another $15.
The third group received $15, on the contrary, before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members lost the money.
So the difference between the two groups was all about the fact that one was stressed by winning and the other by losing.
However, members of the "against loss" group were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the neurologist's hypothesis.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
They have so far explained the appearances of the observable during auctions of the joys of victory and avoiding the risk.
Until the neurological imaging methods helped us resolve the difference between these two theories by now reaching a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to find a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is reported among the main causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 of them are being treated, and the reason is that patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a summary of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, a marked inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the originators of the disease and the diseases they cause differ from one another.
Depending on the underlying diseases, hepatitis type A and E is spread in two main ways: hepatitis type A and E digestive system (e.g. infected with food, water), hepatitis type B, C, D and other blood and body fluid viruses (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
Passengers should in any case protect themselves by vaccination against A and B, there is no vaccine-type C virus.
Hepatitis A symptoms appear two to three weeks after eating infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, vomiting.
Then a jaundice, light stool, and dark urine will form on the skin and on the whites of the eyes. Treatment may take two to three weeks.
Each year, millions of people will die worldwide for the more serious type of disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that it is estimated that only every tenth infected is treated medically.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected with their disease do not even know, the cause of the disease destroys the liver cells in secret, and so the first symptoms come in many cases up to 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important that timely prevention is carried out on a regular basis.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more often than on average: among people who have had blood transfusions before 1991, among drug users and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated global number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C is 200 million.
Since the disease can prove a routine laboratory examination, a person should turn to his practical physician if he notices any sign of unknown origin.
In early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing infection and preventing cancer.
September 30th is the world day of hepatitis, which was first organised by organizations representing the sick worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to highlight the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its formation, and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Who believes in God, does it hurt so much?
According to recent research, belief in God works as a certain analgesic that could have made death easier for already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have done an interesting experiment to explore how belief in the god of pain affects a person, reported the British daily Telegraph.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, they subjected 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists to electric shocks, while all observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to eliminate much of the pain.
The technique of examining the human brain has also shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
Research is the first of a series of studies to be attended by scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
The test was carried out precisely by attaching to the left hand of the test subject a sparking instrument that produced electrical shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to carefully observe two paintings: the 17th century Sasferrat Virgin Mary and the 17th century Lady with the Franciscan Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would arouse a certain state of piety among the believers, while da Vinci’s image was chosen because it was not different from the first one and seemed to them a soothing impression.
The test subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanner and received four of the following 20 electroshocks during this period, while separately monitoring the image with a religious or general theme.
The Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe" as if they were "carefully cared for" and "rested, filled with peace".
They felt 12 percent less pain in watching the picture with religious themes than when they had Leonard’s work ahead.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image and atheists, only the right photograph needs to be found.
"We would have to find a picture that will be very positive, from the position of mother or father," said the psychologist.
England's Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases also change our personality," Wright added.
After such excellent results, it is only a matter of what effect it would have on regulating the pain of the believers if they showed them some Madonna from Leonard or a painter of a similar caliber.
Would it mean looking at the quality of the Virgin Mary achieving even better results?
You're what you'll share
Google can declare its tenth birthday that people can find it in their pockets at least as well as in the sky above their heads; they know where they were on vacation, what they were going through and what they were interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, that's still not enough.
However, with regard to skeptics making a parallel with Orwell's dark vision, the very essence of the 2.0 web is not clear.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary for Google founders to stick to their original intention, which he said: "Let's organise all the information in the world!"
According to Google's spokesman, after ten years of secular work, only at the beginning can she work with all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer questions like "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what work would actually be good for me?" – on such seemingly simple questions, however, software will not be able to answer until they know enough information about users.
Not all internet users well know that during the internet search the exact words you are looking for are also captured from which IP address you were looking for and which pages you are looking for have moved to.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, for example, users can keep their surfing history, look back at what they were looking for and what they were clicking on, and then generate, in the long-term perspective, findings adapted to them much more directly - the same logic will also be based on the Recommendation service, through which the system will offer products and services on the basis of previously mentioned and preserved preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone sees what I'm doing? - they ask the users who have a fear when looking at Google data monopoly.
In most cases, the scope of potential power represented by the company, the counter-reaction does not create awareness in internet users of guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or even rebellion against power.
However, it is confirmed that all the expressions sought are not only captured, but in justified cases can also be issued by a third party, in such legal cases the personal rights of internet users do not protect anything.
The most famous example of recent times was probably coordinated action against Brazil’s paedophiles, during which he provided Google’s Brazilian Government with information that enabled the identification of pedophiles from Orkut’s community pages through it.
Internet users who are concerned about personal rights could, however, still have breathed in May, when a company hand in hand with an EFF electronic rights organization successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google must not be forced to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI in the future.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought out nearly fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it obtained by appealing for strengthening before the years of the adopted Child Protection Act, but failed to obtain lists of individual users' items, as well as complete lists of websites and keywords covering a period of two months.)
Google’s opinion is so controversial: it is whipped by those who fear the provision of their personal data, because it feels that their intimate sphere and private life will be by using Google’s services, being exposed to injury, and acting against it with a revolution, which belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
Meanwhile, America's geek culture and its wild stalemate, bringing together enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees a new generation as a big-fired, "corporation that is currently storming", unlike its rival Microsoft, considered by Windows to be conquerors of the world, however they both fight for the same goals.
This can be caused by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require its users' identification code and does not want them to be paid for its application; an open, free and continuously fresh source of information and a package of programs acts as much more accessible, more youthful, "cooler" than an official software giant.
However, it can also be caused by the fact that geeks understand precisely the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personal rights, which has brought exactly one of the most enviable keywords in recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing but cooperation, that we deliberately leave our tracks behind and use the communication channels that we have available, and although their range is different, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can keep a profile right on several community pages from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or the last app.fm, which records music that he listens to, all of which can then be connected to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, besides a blog that will automatically display his latest photo gallery, which he stores on Flickr or Picasso.
However, we can learn about a lot of the extra cases that she turns out to be: a friend in the morning when she looks at a flood of photos of common friends she can easily figure out who her silly friend was spending the night with, or can throw away his employee just because he has a sincere opinion on top management on his blog: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has been completely reexamined today.
The one who lives an online life consists of what he shows, so we can define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And anyone who wants to hide or at least avoid Google Monopoly has the option (beginning Scrooge, which uses Google search engine, however, deliberately leaves no trace).
For example, a small number of people do not register on community pages on purpose to not be able to find them. The Google Online application from the text editor to the editor and the news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to the giant server parks and that do not make up the most quality profile possible.
Public opinion does not expect too much of a secret when Google shows teeth.
The company has a current value of $156 billion more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising areas are threatening investment by advertising agencies and services introduced at a constant pace seriously impairing the life of not only Microsoft but also many other software designers.
However, critical observers also find counterpoints that have an unsettling impression: top management, for example, rejected employee protests after twice the company's fee, and any frequent daily meals of employees were too costly, but all of this is lost, in addition to the fact that Google had already bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and, in the sense of their agreement, to filter out any finding that is of good taste, in respect of the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never introduces new services ahead of time, only when it can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the coming months and years can be diverted from the world in new places: while some believe that Google's project is aimed at scanning and archiving books and magazines is taking on such dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with America's Supreme Court, others fear its Health system, in which we can compile a complete medical profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google compiles a genetic database can then serve as a good starting material for the next generation of writers sci-fi, the famous novelist Cory Doctorow "Scroo-view" describes with Orwellian reministances a future in which you can only approach a person with the help of Google data.
A double killer from Ózd was helped to remove the marks of two young people
Two juveniles interviewed the police in the case of a double homicide in Ózd, according to reasonable suspicion, were helping to remove the traces of the crime, the spokesman for the Supreme Police Directorate of the Borsod County said on Tuesday.
Persons have been found guilty of acts involving suspects and are currently accused of aiding a criminal offence.
Both juveniles, according to MTI information two girls, are being prosecuted for freedom.
Assistance to a crime is punishable by deprivation of liberty for up to 5 years.
A suspect from a double homicide in Ozda, a 23-year-old man here, was taken into custody on Sunday.
He's a suspect in a pre-planned multiple-murdering crime for common reasons.
During the investigation, it was apparent that a 23 - year - old young man owed 53 - year - olds more.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so he lured his creditor to a plant in Ózd last Wednesday, where he first killed a man and then his 9 - year - old daughter.
According to the MTI, the young man was preparing for the crime in advance, which is also evidenced by the fact that the murder was committed by a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
The weapons and the circumstances of their use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange to buy a 100 per cent stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party, even though the Czech Republic had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the range of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the state owns the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants 60 percent of the securities sold in a few months.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, Polaków’s offer represents the highest amount that has yet to be offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech papers, the Viennese Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse were still offered.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all stakeholders, and did not rule out that this could lead to the collapse of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by experts at stock markets to be 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholder agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with approximately 25 per cent stake, followed by the Czech Savings Bank with 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 per cent.
On the financial crisis from the perspective of the European leaves
In their Tuesday comments devoted to the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European leaves are reminded of "the second September 11th".
We can thank the American President for the global financial disaster, the charges of the Roman La Repubblica. The President was not even able to sew his own side in support of the quickly paid bill aimed at correcting this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which was reminded by billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk about the second September 11th.
Also part of Madrid's press sees the culprit in Washington.
According to the daily El Mundo, the world economy has brought to a close the collapse of the lack of political leadership there.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system continues to grow, for which the world will eventually pay.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool to resolve the crisis.
World economy hangs in the air - just when one of the biggest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be overlooked, points to the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
To date, individual states can throw a life-saving circle to the money institutions, and taxpayers can save them from the collapse.
However, if other banks collapse like Dominum cubes, there will be no more money or improvisation.
In the long term, it is necessary that the Member States of the European Union move through their national egoism and unify control of fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, they received more than 100 billion euros in financial institutions, reminding Vienna's Der Standard that, as Americans do, they are concerned that in order to address the crisis, they will have to reach deep into their pockets and European taxpayers, more and more realistic.
The European Union has been experiencing a crisis that has been falling like a tsunami on the old continent until now, seriously, has not been addressed.
The "saviors" do not have to have hundreds of billions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they firmly determined in which case it is reasonable to reach for taxpayers' money to avoid even more damage.
An intelligent car imitates the flight of a bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop technologies capable of preventing collisions if not mimicking obstacles in the world of nature?
Like the bees.
The original strategic idea of a surprising project presented at the CEATEC Japan Fair was introduced to engineers from Nissan Beetle. It was about building a new generation of systems that prevent collisions.
In cooperation with the Tokyo University, Nissan designed a biomimetic robot control system BR23C, a robotic minicar equipped with bee properties, with the ultimate aim of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is actually very similar to our safety cover," explained Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of the brand for Technology PR and Research and Development.
The complex eyes play an important role, allowing bees to see more than 300 degrees in all directions.
In order to copy the complex eye function, engineers were involved in the idea of laser long-range.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 metres ahead of BR23C in the 180-degree field, calculates their distance and sends signals to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns into a collision prevention operation.
The obstacle is captured during a fraction of a second, then the robotic car starts to imitate the movements of the bees and turns the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent collisions immediately change direction.
Unlike any existing system, this evasive maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive manner.
"If that were not the case, a robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and a robot car project.
They must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology fits the most vulnerable and inner layer of the safety cover, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what bees do to avoid other bees.
This process must not take longer than the eye blinks.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be upward, downward or upward, it can only be two-dimensional and only in a direction that can be rotated.
In the case of a robot car, instead of endless possibilities offered to bees, only the possibility of rotating movement, speeding up and slowing down was applied.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer accumulators that are lighter and have higher energy density, which means they have longer durability than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, it is an important instinctive, intelligent reaction, not a processing ability, but less data storage.
This mechanism must process and respond to only a few incoming signals per second.
It is not necessary to store and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres, so it constantly uses only a few kilobytes of memory.
He doesn't need a memory with a giga- or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing a technology for immediate avoidance, which is estimated to reach a series of vehicles within ten years.
Another possibility of application may be the connection of the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the motorist to the specified end-point after the escape.
A bloody dear child already has a name
The bailout bill of $700 billion, which is to be split into several instalments and the aim of which is to buy out non-quality bank loans, is already in writing.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
Following further talks, which ended on Saturday after midnight Eastern Time, Congress representatives reached an agreement in a few days on the ongoing debate on the rescue package totalling 700 billion dollars, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," announced Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the House of Representatives, according to which only the signing of the agreement is left.
Both Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the package compromise.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson announced the result of the compromise: "The programme will work and will be effective, but further steps must be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 o'clock in the Washington time (then at 2 o'clock in the morning of the Central European time), however, no special rise in the stock exchange was effected.
The 2008 Law on Emergency Economic Stability, which is to be set up, will be voted on Monday first by the House of Representatives, followed by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, after which reports of an agreement were also welcomed at the White House.
"We are satisfied with the progress that has been made at night, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program differs, in part, from the Bush administration's original proposal, in which it was intended to provide a total of $700 billion for the purchase of non-quality mortgage-backed securities.
Now it is possible to spend at least half of the amount of 700 billion in the first round, and that is that 250 billion will be used immediately after the Congress decides on Monday, and the finance department will buy for them securities secured by mortgages that are assessed as poor, then the fate of the remaining $100 billion will depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be monitored by a special body, which will also be a member of the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The spending of the second half of $700 billion will depend on the next decision of Congress.
The Ministry of Finance may, within the meaning of the law, apply a combination of tactics: it can at the same time buy out non-quality loans, mortgages and mortgages secured by mortgages, and other "equipable" loans.
The redemption may take place within the auctions and directly, the competent representatives of the ministry reported.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to take part in an insurance scheme in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee for funds that are a cause of concern, for which companies will pay the price corresponding to the amount of the damage expected.
According to Henry Paulson, the law provides the necessary means to pay up to $700 billion to meet the urgent requirements of the US financial system, whether it be an extensive purchase of bad funds, insurance, or averting the systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the major monetary institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, the chief banks that have gotten into trouble and are waiting for the help of the state can count on the government to lower their distances - which is simply called a "golden parachute" in the overseas slang.
They will be limited only in certain cases, and these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction basically means that if the Ministry buys in the course of the auction, a tax premium will be imposed on gold parachutes if the failing bank directors are not sent to retirement.
In the event of a direct buy-back of non-quality loans, the government will aggressively step forward in order to ensure that the money for management is not excessive.
It is necessary to add that the existing golden parachute contracts do not change, the restrictions concern only new contracts, which is to be another incentive to participate in the programme.
"This is the first case in American history where there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of the Directors-General," said the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State in the banks participating in the programme will have the right to acquire the share, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, as once the economy and the bank together are placed on their feet, they can also make money on this transaction.
The proposal states that over the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal setting out how the expected losses from the financial sector can be recovered to taxpayers.
Of course, there were also voices on both sides in connection with the plan of doubt.
"This is not what American citizens have asked us to do, because this is what a dollar of taxpayers will not protect," said California congressman Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that it was precisely those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street who insisted on adopting the provisions.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to 12.9 percent in August 2007, the Central Statistical Office announced.
Export sales prices in the industry increased by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent year-on-year.
Industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent year-on-year by 3.2 per cent as the result of changes in domestic and export prices compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 percent, due to the previous month's minimum.
The domestic sales prices in the processing industry also slightly increased by 0,1 % compared to July.
The biggest price increase took place in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industries (2.8 per cent), mainly due to the monthly increase in prices in brasar and sedary products by 4.6 per cent, in terms of footwear production by 2.5 per cent.
Higher price levels of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly price increase in the production of chemical materials and products (1.6 per cent).
Price reductions occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), the production of electrical machinery and apparatus (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum - in the woodworking sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices in paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other processing industries, we measured price increases between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sector, which weighs heavily in the domestic industry, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, especially by the continuing influence of the officially determined increase in gas prices from 1 July.
In the 12-month comparison of domestic consumption in the various sectors of the processing industry, prices increased most in the professional oil processing sector (32.4 per cent).
In the co-production sector, 13.2 per cent could be observed in the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products which have a decisive weight, then 11 per cent price increase.
Price reductions occurred in textile and textile manufacturing sectors (2.5 per cent) and the production of electrical machinery and apparatus (0.3 per cent).
In other processing industries, the rate of price growth ranged between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the processing industry increased by 10.2 per cent last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sector exceeded prices from the previous year by 18.7 percent.
In terms of sector-wide distribution, the highest monthly increase in prices (0.7 per cent) in the production of tangible assets was shown in August in the domestic sales.
In sectors producing consumer goods prices increased by 0.3 per cent, in energy processing and further processing sectors prices did not change due to the previous month.
The largest price increase due to the same month of the previous year was possible in August 2008 in the energy processing and further processing sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods sector, we measured an increase in prices of 6.8 per cent, on the other hand, in material assets the price decrease of 1.4 per cent.
The export sales prices of industrial products measured in Forinté in August increased by 1.1 per cent compared to the previous month, with a 12-month comparison of 3.9 per cent.
Our home payment decreased by 1.7 per cent over one month due to the euro, and by 7.1 per cent compared to August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent compared to the euro and by 15.9 per cent compared to the dollar.
Next year we're going to the United States without a visa?
According to Kingy Goncz, there is great hope that around January 12th, the US-Hungary visa-free agreement will enter into force, the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about this in front of local Hungarian community leaders.
In her opinion, "it is almost all that matters now if an electronic road permit system is built at sea in due time, in respect of checks".
At the same time, it noted that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists will have to register before departure.
As of today, the Hungarian diplomat continues in the Washington talks.
He will meet Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Central Cross to the Star of the Order for credits to the Hungarian Republic and will conduct interviews with the foreign policy advisors of the Presidential candidate for Democratic Party of Barack Obama and the Republic of John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for the bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major American parties, assured on Sunday their support for the government's bailout package of $700 billion, however, are also politicians who demand the demission of the minister of finance.
Following a several-day marathon of Congress meetings and administrative representatives, it was announced on Sunday morning: a basic bailout package was concluded.
A financial package aimed at overturning the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are similarly referred to as the most suitable of both candidates who would lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys together with how they got to the forefront of the economic issue, Obama again gained a certain advantage and McCain's head start spread, which he secured after the Republican convention by Sarah Palin's nomination as vice president.
Obama expressed hope Sunday at the Detroit Election Assembly that a 700 billion - billion - package law would be passed quickly by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contained passages concerning consumer protection, which he also supported.
"We must act immediately, responsibly...) to your places, savings, the whole industry, the stability of the entire economy threatens danger," he said in front of a 35-thousand crowd.
He didn't miss the opportunity to call McCain's notions of economics obsolete.
McCain said in an interview with ABC TV: "It's going to be a bit of a struggle... but nothing doing just isn't possible."
As the Republican Senator put it, the proposal sets out the establishment of a commission overseeing the Minister of Finance and the limitation granted to the top representatives on whom he has insisted.
Obama for the CBS station declared that McCain had no more important role to play in the negotiations than he himself was with the minister in daily contact.
On Sunday, the President of the House of Nancy Pelosi said that the House of Representatives would vote on the bill by Monday.
Overview of German language print
The right-wing camp is intact, only voters within it became more confident - so analyzes the weak result of CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spigel.de)
In the online edition of the left-hand German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats His Fathers".
According to a noted political scientist, CSU's erosion began long before its office took over the sad duo Beckstein-Huber.
The Christian Socialists have been restoring Bavaria for decades - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The cutting of the period is a problem of all Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The debate was not completely surprising for CSU, but on Saturday the process ended, which could have been expected for nearly ten years: the undeniable hegemony of one state party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent for the first time since 50 years below the 50 percent limit.
This was repeated three years ago during the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, even in the period so often referred to as Stoiber.
The reason is the modernisation that CSU has consistently carried out in this country and that is being eaten by its parents.
The sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at a pace they have been very wrong. Secularizations, educational results, the residence of Germans from the east and from the north in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not have been without consequence of the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation is linked to growing opportunities, which also has visible political implications.
The right-wing camp is unbroken, only the voters within it have become more confident, more critical, more self-sufficient.
It is also obvious that in recent weeks CSUs have fared the most from the classical civil layers; people in free occupation, tradesmen, graduates and higher education.
This has already reduced CSU support to below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepress.com)
A conservative Viennese journal in its article entitled "Who, Who, With Who? The presidents are on the issue of coalitions withholding" deals with a confused internal political situation arising from the Austrian elections.
The EESC wishes to deal with ÖVP.
The ÖVP shall advocate interfering with the SPÖ with its internal affairs.
BZÖ appears to be open to all negotiations, greens are not yet ready to negotiate on the coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything is spinning around the coalition; in a debate organised on public television, the presidents of the parties did not have much to look at in their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed his wish to deal with ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is certainly possible - in some social countries and in the social partnership.
The question whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of ÖVP, as Vice Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As Schüssel-Molter's course was said to have been voted out for every fall.
Repeating this direction is out of the question.
Molterer responded to the red offers carefully.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere with the internal affairs of ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition, it is so far completely open on the side, these issues need to be addressed definitely within the ÖVP.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider again appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóková: A vicious circle of poverty and segregation needs to be broken
In Paris today, the European Summit on Equality, which is hosted by France, is the current Presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóková, a member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of professional grading in her message addressed to the plenary, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children, and also the most serious obstacle to their application.
He opened the summit - on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
To negotiate among invited government representatives, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil society working in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MEPs, Fideš Járóková pointed out that alongside the discrimination in recruitment of labour, the Roma are forced from the European labour market primarily because of their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma have no secondary education and because of the poor quality of basic education they can achieve a higher level of education, only a small part of them."
Járóková further stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investing in early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MP, it is necessary to establish awareness of these links in the widest circles - between Roma and non-Roma children.
The sooner a Romani student starts school, the greater the chance of becoming a productive member of the labour market; the more they contribute to the national budget through income tax and excise duty.
"It is the right of the Roma to ensure the right to quality education and guarantee the removal of their under-quality and separate education," Lívia Járóková said.
According to the Member State, the coherence of the European Union, with emphasis on the objective and the negotiations, is needed in order to speed up the processes of the desegregation of schools, and it is essential that the existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations be properly observed.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment needs to be broken, so that Roma children can participate as full citizens in Europe's future," Járók demanded.
Each member of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities' guarantees the objective of the European Summit on Equality, organised every year since the Berlin meeting, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and eliminate discrimination at the level of Europe and the individual Member States.
CSU: temporary grace
The fate of Duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the disgraceful election debacle, the debate on personal issues has so far been postponed by Bavaria's CSU.
The President of Erwin Huber and Earth Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may still remain in their seats as long as this grace lasts.
The fate of Tandem, who has suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of votes, will be decided by the party's extraordinary convention during the last October weekend.
In any case, members of a highly criticized duo were allowed to hear that they would not be able to take full advantage of their posts.
So they tried to calm the angry members of the faction and base, who for the loss of an absolute majority demanded a day after the "Bavor tsunami" export of personal consequences.
Five years ago - truth, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of her career - the Christian-social union gained 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but only 43.4 percent had the strength.
CSU has been in Bavaria producing 18% of German GDP "self-governing" for 46 years.
Although conservatives in the southern federal country continue to have a key role for the Hungarian economy, they will still be forced to coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of reorganisation within the party is the fact that a member of the narrow intelligence team who will launch a probe hearing on a possible coalition of the monk government with a liberal FDP, with respect to the right-wing group of the Free Voters, will also be Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered to be the possible successor to Huber.
It is ironic that Gabriela Pauli, the candidate of the Free Voters, used the duo Huber-Beckstein to carry out his campaign against Stoiber and then made a ruthlessly short process with ambitious municipal political forces.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transitional period, Stoiber, who has come from behind until now, will also have an active role, the former Prime Minister of Earth, and former CSU President, on 28 September, called his political career the most enduring day.
On Monday, Huber spent a number of driving notes on the CDU’s address and, according to him, they would be far more supportive of the sister’s side.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to both CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor if CSU, which played a significant role in the 2005 national success, does not somehow build its legs with common forces.
According to Merkel, who has hardly concealed her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on Berlin's big coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier and the crisis of social Democrats will continue.
The SPD achieved 18.6 percent of the worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko:separation - 110:0
In Sunday's elections, not a single opposition MP arrived in the Belarusian Parliament.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexandr Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE), by the illegalities which occurred in the assembly of votes.
OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10 million-nation country lacked opposition for a good ten years, the opposition, united on behalf of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before the elections last night, had seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who, on the basis of the amendment of the constitution in elections with the debated process in 2006, would re-establish his presidential mandate, would "allow" this time to have several opposition Members present in Parliament.
ODS has thus abandoned the previously considered boycott.
In the background of opposition expectations, it was that Russia was increasingly heavily dependent on Belarus - which, in order to mitigate the impact of the ever-inflicted Russian natural gas imports, took credit and contributed to bringing Beltransgaz, the owner of the pipelines of the country, into Russian hands - wishing to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to the Belarusian political establishment assessed as anti-democratic Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians were not granted entry permits.
The release had previously indicated that OSCE, when assessing the electoral campaign, placed emphasis on positive developments and not on shortcomings - for example, on a ban on a third of the opposition candidates.
However, Monday's OSCE flash report already had reservations about the campaign, during which the opposition candidates could not actually appear in the press, especially since the opposition cannot be present to add votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, there can be only improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released to freedom, and Minsk is willing to engage with Moscow even in smaller confrontations if it continues to reject Georgia's rejected South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms the federal state, has considered the two territories independent for the past month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started," said our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remain the same, even though "it was very much to let a single member of the opposition into a meaningless parliament".
In view of the opposition's results, he does not plan protest actions, rather trying to deliver his message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"There are many problems with this, of course, that we have to print opposition letters in Russia, that they put obstacles to local authorities, but I see that the change is increasingly supported by more and more people, even among older ones," Milinkevich said, pointing out that Lukashenko's regime, which considers to be its greatest success the creation of social security, is not considered to be the right or officially the most supported layer of pensioners.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the growth of business deficit, it is only a matter of time before social security 'insulting quiet cemetery' collapses," Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition policy, the Russian election observers were viewed as democratic.
The Head of the Community of Independent States, Sergey Lebedev, Russian intelligence agency Ria Novosti, said that "people do not believe words, but acts", so the absence of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that a rotating door was introduced when the employees arrived and left.
From now on, however, this new measure against the wicked will work, against those who bite and then go to coffee during their working hours.
The news against laziness was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renat Brunette, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Mauri Masi.
"The rotating door - says Brunetta - is a tool for better work, higher performance, more power and more services," the minister said.
"A new period of responsibility and transparency will now be opened.
This is about reformism," Brunetta also emphasises.
The Chigi Palace will complete the introduction of the Council Presidency in all buildings.
For Masiho, "the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections from employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a joint procedure with workers and cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven in the morning."
During one conference at the University of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister will finally announce that within three months, the absence of public workers for the disease decreased by 50%, which means 60,000 more persons per year at work."
And it adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
"their pay-as-you-go dynamic – explained the Minister – has doubled over the past 8-10 years due to the private sector and is far higher than the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have gathered to reject Brunette's decree in accordance with a request supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Administration will present today figures on the lower absence of work due to illness – he writes of the Consumer Protection Association – the people of 'the effluent lazy' are constantly growing.
In Italy we have thousands of productive and correct employees in public administration who have gathered to declare war with illegal standards contained in the decree."
On Taru, it will mainly protest the exclusion of hospital allowances which depend on activities; the extension of the period in which the patient can be checked, the time-limits in which the check-ups will be carried out and the other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Work injury, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day in Italy there will be 2,500 work injuries, three people will die, and twenty-seven will remain permanently disabled.
Inail values confirm that for 2007, we have roughly 1,200 deaths as a result of work injuries.
These values testify to the seriousness of the prosecution, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double deaths compared to murder.
In order to re-emphasize the attention of institutions, social and information resources on this dramatic problem, Anmil is celebrating in all Italian regions the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents, set for the second Sunday in October.
"The disturbing data extended by the Anmil and the same tragic reports these days confirm how important the issue of safety of work is," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for Freezers and Disability for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his lively admiration for the continuous joint effort on job security, protection of injured workers, assistance to families of victims and participation in public opinion."
"In a natural way, there has been an uproared 'dost', frankly shared face-to-face with tragedy, which has caused a stir in the media and participation of public opinion, but daily reality again offers dramatic cases, even repeating itself in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is no doubt a source problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
In particular, numerous educational initiatives are being taken to ensure that young people facing the world of work gain a clearer awareness.
It is necessary to note this phenomenon, not to give up because of its alarming social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
On his part, the President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini stressed that "as a result of the death of a work injury, it creates an absolutely critical social condition, as it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort towards the necessary cessation of this situation."
"As for the dates of the work injuries, it seems that they show a positive turn, but it does not deny that the number of deaths as a result of the work injury is as alarming as it is," President Anmila Pietro Mercandelli noted again.
"We don't want this "direction for reduction" to lead to less attention, because the moment the attention stops, tragedy breaks out.
"We believe that there is too little in general to stop the problem of injuries and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion - Mercandelli stressed - to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training of workers, right from the school age".
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - regarding communication and public participation.
But most importantly, there is a greater sense of responsibility for employers to the phenomenon, which represents an exceptional social phenomenon. "
Mercandelli finally declared that it was a progressive degeneration of the level of right to compensation foreseen for working victims and the "removal of supportive care" to which the system has been received in recent years."
"The aim is therefore to return the employee to the insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who harm themselves must not depend on spontaneousness or giving time to the legislators from time to time."
Mp3 players accused, exposed to risk
Listen to loud music for a longer time and use portable music instruments as Mp3 players may cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a notice published today by the European Commission, which has been circulated in Brussels to quote the opinion of the Committee on Health Risk Science, which has recently risen and identified (Csrseri) Eu.
"From this scientific point of view – we read in notes – it turns out that 5-10% of those who for at least five years listen to music using portable musical instruments, weekly more than an hour a day, and maintain a high volume device, risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that so many young people who use often portable musical instruments and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unknowingly damage their hearing in an uncorrectable way," admitted Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings – the leader continues – give rise to a clear risk and have to respond quickly.
What is most important is that we must encourage consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to review the existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding, so that they become fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem in view of the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Scientists – the Executive Officer Eu has concluded – confirm that there is a need to be concerned and now the European Commission will examine together with other members and parties who have raised the problem, what measures could possibly be put in place to better protect children and young people from the noise exposure of which portable instruments and similar devices are the originator of which."
At present, there is already a European security standard that limits the level of noise of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage that can be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to limit these damages very much by seeking solutions as a reduction in the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee states that users of portable musical instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for a period of only five hours a week, exceed the currently valid limits corresponding to the maximum permitted noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk permanent loss of hearing after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and their amount can be estimated between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno leaves the Commission free to move forward for the future of the capital
Today we begin, in March we close, in June we will have sums.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning in its new residence behind Caracal baths.
President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up manuals for Rome within six months.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunt and the General Council will assess the analyses and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of Campidoglia and its councilman Gianni Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas – it wants to emphasise Alemanno – it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by the political decision-makers who remain Giunta e General Council.
It is not about any exchange of functions, but only about trying to have some place where to work out a great project for Rome.
In March, the work will be completed and then dissolved, as these institutions must have an exact time frame.
In June – the mayor announces – we will present a strategic plan and take advantage of the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome".
To the one who accuses the Commission of futility because its opinion will not be binding, Alemanno will reply: "It is all about the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are as good as the Attali Commission's proposals, and I am sure of that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics will cry out about everyday problems and the urgency that will arise from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to emphasise that "this Commission is neither a useless enterprise nor a bluff: it is completely free, the citizens of Rome will not stand for the euro and will serve to think and engage the best intelligence the capital has".
For Alemann, essentially, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan as a starting point, neither definite nor immobil to allow our city to have the authentic rise at the level that it needs, and to think in a united spirit on its future."
The future, which, according to the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited only to the current general border, but will look much further" not only at the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status the capital, but "it will include the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
A famous American president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, decimated the economy of the United States and maintained relations (as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam."
The attacks against Obama are increasing just as the date of the elections approaches.
One lady from Miami wrote on the web: "This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the nerve: he thinks he will reach the highest position of the nation, which had two governors and five black senators everywhere!".
In fact, these attacks do not say much"; they are attacks of clearly racial origin and do not answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? And then we have surveys; they all say that Obama will win and with a big head.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
One newspaper from Mississippi, from the belly of the South of the United States, wrote a comment: for once in the polling booth, we know well who the American patriot will give his voice to.
One side of American mentality will come up, which has remained scythe until the last moment.
Say what you want, we'll take care of it ourselves, if Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
But beyond all these considerations for Democrats, George Bush's main weapon is.
They asked 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent him home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were rescued, and the Americans were not forced to pack up.
And yet Iraq became for most Bush's weaknesses.
Whoever takes the place of Georgia W will have to perform a huge task.
The U.S. economic collapse was felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in the newspapers, and many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the state of their profession and the assumption of the future.
Well, today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly say that they were less concerned about credibility.
He doesn't feel isolated like he used to.
The problem is for American journalists money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis in 2008 is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
Despite the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put the newspaper together, they are a huge problem.
According to the journalists concerned, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism to change significantly as widely understood by the general public.
The American journalist goes through a clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten pressmen and executive seniors are convinced that a journalist on a national scale is making a bad trip.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against a broadcast.
For journalists it is not difficult to see where the website goes.
The bigger publishing industry travels to the Internet, which many view as a "killer" of print.
The "economic pressure" highlighted by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred journalists questioned admitted that they were leaning towards technology in the hope that for their journalist, "they would do something good".
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run newsrooms – that is, leaders – and reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are confident that their reporters share their values, while at local level the value drops to 23%.
This has something to do with "certain work" for someone.
Leaders who think they lose their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, they move to 30%.
As for "certain work" regarding personnel (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In such a vast nation as Usa, with three hundred million inhabitants, and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want to take or leave the question.
Leaders receive almost always huge salaries, and the editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month outside of pension and insurance payments.
As far as vacations are concerned, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year, up to 15 days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists often get sick during one year, according to their own confession.
It's just a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: JUDGMENT IN LINE, COPPOL DETAILED IN GROTTAFERRATES
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the submission of an entrepreneur with the real estates of Daniel Coppola, who requested that he be able to move from his town, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the counter-offender sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the own-cost process, he received last week's release from home prison, which was converted into a forced permanent stay in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that a realtor with real estate change his place of residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this movement (to which pm has been expressed) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence they are accusing him of.
Elity in Danger
This phenomenon appeared a few days ago when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the rescue plan to provide $700 billion to the White House: a significant proportion of Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is breaking the republican side, constantly more divided between its old East Coast soul, milder, receptive to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, which is, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "the ones from Washington" and to the world of finance, strong mainly in the states in the middle and in the south.
A soul that manifested arrogantly by the vote I spoke of at the beginning.
But this just quoted thing is just an example of changes, big changes that the current economic earthquake already shows: not only in the United States, but in the whole West and perhaps not just here.
Both in Usa and in Europe, it seems that this crisis works as an accelerator to the phenomena that have been in the incubation for a long time, which have grown tight in the new climate and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the regeneration, the extraordinary revival of the market, the dual category of State power in relation to a certain renationalisation of the economy.
Indeed, the crisis is a crisis of financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but in which the budgets of people and families living in a single country are mainly included to the greatest extent.
This created a political problem for those who run it at the same time: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also voters.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be essentially out of the question or that it has nothing to add: obvious evidence was given by the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different national strategies and which cannot be decided on a common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, rescue plans, market recovery, new rules and especially the distribution of funds: at the moment we get into a tight spot, only states have economic means, a lot of financial resources to be able to try to put everything in order.
It also has the necessary means and authority to use them: two sources of enormous value, under certain circumstances, that no market and no international organisation will ever be able to have it to the same extent.
This new emphasis, which the crisis places on the national-national element, is, in fact, in full compliance with the growing importance of trying to make recent economic progress one factor closely linked to it: territorial nationality.
Paradoxically in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of the sieve, ever more sophisticated technology, having the imagination, while we were convinced that the world's finances were already destined to rule the world, out of nothing we realized that our future would have to struggle more and more with such little intangible things as water, oil, oil.
All things who would say so can be moved from one place on earth to another, but in any case they are linked, absolutely, to the restricted space, to the territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler certainly has more cards in his sleeve than who isn't him and who has the misfortune of living in a place without oil and no water.
I'm getting a second news story, which, however, predicts a break.
Who talks about territory, the state, the government, inevitably talking about politics, that is, leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, it seems that two convergence phenomena are being created.
On the one hand, realizing that there is an objective need for authoritative leadership, a request for someone who can grasp the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of dissension towards existing leadership, particularly economic leadership, which has proved to be equally inappropriate and full of dark spots.
And together something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: discriminating, impatient, incompetence and inability to be present, trying to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems that there is an increasing spread in the masses of the population of belief, rather than that their actions are the same as the ideas of the popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the right sense of the word, that the elite have already overcome their time and is indifferent to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership briefly feeds on one branch from the underground, but a strong movement to remove the ruling classes and traditional political arrangements is manifested in the sudden election "rebellion" or unexpected changes in collective moods in recent and most recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavorsk to the downfall of Labourists in the United Kingdom, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps to do so also has a victory over justice in Italy).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have ever more problems understanding, hence representing, which, not from today, is being created in the deep layers of Western companies and that the economic crisis is getting stronger again, growing, potentially overwhelmingly obnoxious.
Before this, it would be too much to talk about a permanent "mass revolt".
But we certainly can't say that it means having a proper open eye.
Super glue to walk around the walls
Overcoming laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is an object of various American research centres and now a team of four institutes has drawn very close to it.
Scientists managed to keep a stokilogram body glued to the vertical wall with a sticker of only 2.5 centimeters square.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, in Akron, the Georgian Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by a team of researchers is the development of materials already in existence that use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf tubes.
«The foundation of glue can be seen as a series of pipes laid like a stack of spaghetti» explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists inspired the legs of the gecko, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to provide perfect grip.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper showed that the new glue is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time “will simply be detached from the wall” explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a provisional glue" adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk around like Spiderman? Perhaps so, but researchers are thinking of far less fascinating uses as a combination of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon pipes are the conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could concern air space engineering .
So far, no superheroes.
ANOTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to research on new glue.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, California scientists introduced glue formed from microfibrous fibers as hair that cleanses itself of dust by moving around the surface to keep perfect propriety.
Medicines: Never with juices
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, together with some life-saving medicines, their consumption changes with increasing or decreasing effectiveness with serious health effects.
In order for David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, to highlight the risks of juices both ready and fresh in combination with some medications, at the current 263th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, causing a new alarm: just one glass of grape, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some life-saving medicines, to cancel their beneficial effects and to expose patients to risk health.
Grep juice has already been blamed for increasing the toxic effects of some antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines, and neurological drugs.
DRUGS IN RISK– The Italian medical agency itself announced in the information bulletin two years ago and aroused doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers posed by this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink if they take medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NEN GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contains substances that suppress drugs.
Long list of effects suppressed by grapefruit and other juices.
From here the call of Michel Carruby, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "These phenomena are mostly reported immediately to various international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So, always read the illustrative list of medicines you get, and if you encounter anything unclear, don’t worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification” emphasized an expert for Ansa.
Nobel Prize for Economics Paul Krugman
Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old NovoKenyan who teaches at the University of Priceton and who is a famous editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of foreign, economic and political steps taken by Bush administration.
Several months after the September 2001 assassinations, the day Enron broke up, Krugman predicted in a New York Times commentary that the second event would be, in terms of the consequences of the history of the United States, much more important than the first.
A prediction that caused no controversy, which, after years, proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and shocked at the speed with which collapses such as Enron and Worldcom disappeared from public interest, Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Binigo Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is "an economy of great importance", but also a popularizer that has "a very aggressive style, particularly critical against the excesses of Bush's liberalist administration".
Open Office, we have the third edition of the package"anti-Microsoft»
It is issue day Open Office.org 3.0, a package of open source personal production that aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to a more famous Microsoft Office.
After about a year's work of voluntary workers controlled by the SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office has been shown to the general public with various news: to welcome the screen and to the revised and improved window opening, add another, much more substantial, as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
The emphasis is also placed on cooperation with the Office 2007 package, the Open Office is able to open the document and with a new Microsoft file (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
It is interesting to see the special functions of some models such as what allows you to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the ability to transfer the PDF component to the graphic design and preserve the original page view.
From this point of view, we can still create "PDF hybrids" documents that resemble typical Adobe graphics and have the properties of a table processor or text program.
Cooperation is an element that has been greatly improved within the application programmes: in Excel it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts of change, in the text programme each employee is assigned one color to comments to make the identification clearer in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on transferring some Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should reverse the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, and was added to the English version, which is on the Mirror from Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD may also be sent home or to the workplace on request.
And if the subject of freeness can be a driver for expansion in households, it is the business area of the Open Office package that is much at stake, and it can already count on the various projects implemented in public administration and in schools.
And there is no shortage of offers of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
The Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a table processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for presentations similar to PowerPoint; Dbase, as in the case of the famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, in the end, is a graphic model.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and when we consider that by today we are almost 3 million and 600,000, with the release of a new version it is possible that this figure can be exceeded.
The Kohl results are also positive, it's the fourth case of doping.
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: it is Rakukana Bernhard Kohl, from the team Gerolsteiner, the third classified and winner of the top top shirt.
The report quoted pages from L'Equipe.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive racer on Cer, Epo 3rd generation, after Italy's Riccard Ricco and Leonard Piepoli and Germans Stefan Schumacher, also he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of the Kohl blood samples belong to those carried out in the last weeks by Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the control analysis confirms the positiveness of Ceru, Rakukan will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the two years of disqualification.
Kohla's report on the positiveness of the Epo Third Generation is confirmed by the head of the French Anti-Doping Agency Pierre Bordry, who announced to the Associated Press that he had already reported on the result of the Austrian government.
The 26-year-old Rakukan placed himself on the levels of winners behind Spain by Carlos Sustre and American Cadel Evansem, and he also won a laced top of the top.
Immigrants: Don't York Times ask, is Italy racist?
Italy "as a country of emigrants only in the last house has become the preferred destination of immigrants" accepted with resistance.
It transforms this beautiful country into a nation of racists? So they inquired in a long article of the New York Times that devoted this article to a debate on racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre originating in Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan because he stole a box of cookies.
This case illustrates what the New York Times define as "paradox of the north": the northern areas are also those where "more integration and more work" is registered, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant thinking in the country and the strongest support of the Northern League".
In order to confirm the increasing tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT quotes cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
The new legislation required by the League, which seeks to halt immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
A tendency of both Pope and President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting with Benedette XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and the church to work together to defeat racism".
Students with expensive rent victims - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students doesn't know the crisis.
According to Sunia's latest research, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"It has already reached such dimensions that the entire layers of students have lost their right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to bear," explains Sunia, Laura Mariani, the head of the study office, "in this city, the big demand from students has deformed the market in such a way that it has stimulated the process of price rise, which has also been increasing to residents".
In most cases, the offer of rentals includes several offences: contracts in a free manner, not registered, without a limited rent, and the associated leases.
Sunji needs an exceptional intervention that could be used to regulate prices through the revision of taxes.
If we look at the details of research, we see that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, there is a need for a single bed of about 450 euros, the minimum price of 650 (Bunde Nere) over the average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) for a single room is equal to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria).
In Florence, one bed stands on average EUR 350/400, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones near the university, 250/280 Euros per bed in a double room are needed, from 370 to 500 in single bed.
In Rome, in central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros per single room, 450 beds in a double bed.
Values are slightly lower (EUR 550 per single bed) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room of the Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples there is 300/450 euros for the bed, 400-600 euros for the room, with the highest prices in the Polyclinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want EUR 250/350 for bed, at least 350 for single room.
Prices are definitely lower in smaller cities, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities such as Perugia, where the most frequent phenomenon is renting students from countries outside the European Union, there is finally another anomaly: an increase of roughly 25-30% of the fees they want for foreign students, compared to Italian students.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, the city is disrupting historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls are closed for the benefit of Multiplex.
"The place without movies is like blind, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Thornator successfully records what is happening in the major Italian city centres, as well as in rural towns.
The process of restricting cinemas, the birth of large multisaliums in suburban towns and the subsequent disappearance of monosaliums in central urban areas is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of a real cultural crime.
"It is as if we lost a friend, a friend with whom we shared a piece of road and a lot of emotion," says New Cinema director Paradiso, a film that he won 20 years ago to Thornator Oscar and the grand jury in Cannes, telling the poetry of one village cinema and the sadness of the way of life that must have been lost forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, 316 cinemas have closed their traditional tip, and the highest account has been paid mainly by halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Torín, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures is Emilia-Romagna with the loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first one responsible for their disappearance is the onset of multiplex, are just the three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinemas: by 195 paid more in Lombardy in the last five years, by 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
«Italian procedure has developed irrationally» says Paolo Protti, President Anecu, "is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that those already existing will survive, because when one cinema closes in the city, not all its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then let's not even talk about insufficient funding for the fund for the benefit of the operators: the previous state debt is roughly EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is embarrassing that the government does not respect existing laws.
It would take between 16 million and 18 million euros per year to support the sector."
Interesting is the bologna case, the first Italian city to care for closures and which decided to find the east by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first such type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historical centres and in the suburbs.
Among the planned standards are tax relief steps in favour of operators and the advantages for the audience in terms of mobility: audiences will be able to reach the restricted transport zone and will have special prices to stop and in certain parking areas.
“I like this initiative” says Giuseppe Thornatore, and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures.”
However, it is certain that in order to be able to resist the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema was a theme that was always important: the closing of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and growing up, was a spark that convinced me to start "New Cinema Paradiso", which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass before the already closed Rialt or Quirinal on Nazionale Street, where I shared so much emotion that I do not have to look at the inscriptions blackened with dust, I turn the other way.”
The link between politics and the Mafia group 'ndranget, Mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to regulate the election of the city authority according to the interests of the mob group Piromalli."
The charges brought against the mayor and the V.E.G. Gioie Tauro Giorgiovi Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone and the mayor of Rosarn Carl Martelli, imprisoned this morning because of their external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are difficult.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, an old middleman between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson is a lawyer, the chief's deputy, who is already accused of committing mafia crimes, sentenced to 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards as well as common sense," the state officials wrote when two local authorities expressed their willingness to pay for counsel to Piromallim.
"So they would allow the Mafia Group – the judges write – to officially enter the city's offices and facilitate already such enormous possibilities for public administration control and management."
The president of the Calabrian Regional Commission Agazio Loiero does not hide that "the secret agreements between local institutions and organised criminal underworld are much: "There are areas where the focus of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'ndrangets, heroes who are still undefiled'."
The arrests this morning followed the arrest last July by which police showed that the mob group of Piromalli had received final intervention .
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro has been disbanded since 1991, the reason why the link between organised crime and local administration was then anticipated - was relieved of local politicians' functions in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, who was elected the right-centre coalition at the time of disbandment after a narrower election in May.
He screamed for scandal when the Prefecture ordered the disbandment of the council.
He called for the responsibility of the then Deputy Interior Minister Marc Minniti and accused him of building everything for political reasons, but the judges in the detention order signed this morning explain that the Mafia group had even gone so far as to request a change of draft A3 motorway.
Of the other interviews directed against Dal Torriono, the public prosecutor wrote, "the desire to transfer the claims of entrepreneurs, representatives of some larger group very close, as is generally known, Piromallim and to adapt the elections of public administration to the interests of the Mafia group."
When the energy comes from the waves, they come into the game with a big one.
It is an infinite bearing that covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface and is now being discovered by large world energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, outflows are the new sources of inexhaustible energy on which the look of the colossals like Chevron has now sought to reach out to these sources.
The possibility of creating energy from sea movements has been studied for more than a hundred years, and research has intensified in the 1970s in relation to the first oil crisis.
When oil prices dropped around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went sideways, but now the environmental organisation and the new increase in oil prices gave the sector a new impetus.
World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 said that about 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea waves.
This amount would be twice the energy currently produced in nuclear centres.
Plus, there's currents and tides and tides.
Giants attack.
The company that invested in marine energy was Enersis, who agreed in 2005 to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it seemed like a huge revolutionary move.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more companies are betting more on marine energy than traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies – said the spokesman of one company, which is connected to the U.S. oil wheel, in the economic daily Wall Street Journal – and they are considering opportunities to work with us."
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of a project for the use of marine energy in Alaska.
This signal cannot be underestimated, especially when we consider that it is in Alaska that the U.S. continues to reap oil and recently President Bush has come up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the traces of marine energy and Verdant Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, show an increasing interest according to observers.
Technology, because we need to work out.
Experts talk about technology that is still in the beginning, because they don't know what the impact will have on the use of marine energy on the environment.
Meanwhile, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and do not seem to cause major problems to the ecosystem.
For greater energy production, however, technologies with a greater impact on the media need to be used.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a fighting system that is connected to each other.
The force of waves, which moves with the battles up and down, is changed with the help of cylinders and cylinders to hydraulic pressure within these battles.
The pressure spins the turbine, which delivers energy to the generator.
Energy gets on the shore by submarine cables.
For the time being, there are four facilities of this type in the project phase, which are only waiting for federal approval and some of the energy could serve for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is already producing energy for the shopping centre and parking using six offshore turbines in the New York East River.
The flow of water during the tide and tide causes the turbines to rotate, which the generator lives with this rotating motion.
Verdant said they had a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorization to use this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
Special interest at this point deserves the potential for inflows and outflows, they say at the Institute for Electrical Energy Research.
Although this is an independent factor, inflows and outflows are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and thus fall even more reliable as a source of energy.
It was to the energy of the inflow and outflows of nations like New York, Maine and Alaska, with other coastal states that had already invested $7 and a half million in 2008 and had projected investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
