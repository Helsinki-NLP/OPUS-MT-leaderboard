The interim Governor of Habarov, Mikhail Degtjarev, called on Alexander Gamov, an observer of “Comsomol Truth” to avoid demonizing bribes against rallies in support of the arrested ex-head of the region, Sergey Furgal.
I want to talk to all the political commentators, the political scientists, the participants in every talk show.
We don't need to demonize the people of the Habarov region.
Here live hardworking and wonderful people, shared by Michael Degtreev.
In an interview with Degtjarev, he recalled that he was a member of LDPR and a party of Furgala and added that he wished him good luck in court, and that the party and himself, Vladimir Zyrinovski, would support him in court.
Full text of the interview is published on the KP.ru website.

In two Mexican states, there was an alarm from Hurricane Hanna.
The Mexican National Civil Defence Office has declared an “orange” (high) level of alarm in the two eastern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon, due to the approaching hurricane “Hanna”, TASS reports.

About 800 shelters for the population were prepared by the authorities.
There will be 10,000 people to help people, including rescue workers, the Nazi Guards and the military.

Semilarski v. Procurator's Office: ex-Vice-Mier Tartu's cassation will be reviewed on 4 August
This means that it is likely to be decided in early September.
The courts of the first two courts dismissed Semilarski ' s claim, but in April his cassation complaint was brought before the Court of State.
The Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant on 12 December 2019 because her authorization was not within the jurisdiction of the administrative court.
The court ' s ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for damages in criminal proceedings.
“The prosecution and the court of departure should regulate such matters,” explained ERR Press Secretary of the Tartu Courts, Annette Cratesmann.
She said that Walvo Semilaski appealed the decision before the District Court, which on 5 February did not change the decision of the Court of First Instance.
Now the Lord will have to say his word.
According to counsel Semilarski, Oliver Nees's juror, his client was unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
It now requires the Public Prosecutor ' s Office to refute false allegations and to compensate him for moral harm.
The complainant ' s allegations in the special cases of the Lebanese District Prosecutor ' s Office of Margus Gross in October 2017 were the reason for the complaint, when Semilarski and others, at that time Deputy Mayor Tartu Artem Suvorov, were detained on suspicion of several crimes.
“We will recall that, when I was detained, the Police and the Prosecutor ' s Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential authorities of local self-governments, were sold.
These hanging public suspicions accompanied me for about two years.
Now that these allegations and suspicions have proved false, the Prosecutor's Office does not want to say anything about it," Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nees, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor should act.
“The claim of bribes and sales proved false, but it is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings in Russia as well as in Lithuania that, at the stage of the investigation, representatives of the State must be careful to choose the words so that suspects are not represented as criminals before sentencing.
The presumption of innocence, which unfortunately was not respected in this case against Walvo Semilarski, is also binding on the Prosecutor's Office," Nees said.
“Samillarski’s public perception as a serious offender and briber in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still found to be unacceptable, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the complainant”, he added.
According to Rus.err.ee, former Deputy Mayor Tartu Walvo Semilarski will not be held accountable for the charges of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is accused of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation in dealing with particularly large-scale transactions.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, former Deputy Mayor Tartu participated more than thirty times in meetings of the City Administration in decisions involving companies operating in Tartu, whose owners or leaders Semilarski had actively communicated at the personal level in extra-working hours.
According to Gross, Semillarski had a personal interest in all of these cases, and therefore had to refrain from participating in the decision-making process.
Earlier, as Russian.err.ee wrote, the Prosecutor ' s Office had raised Semilarian suspicions of acquiring bribes and violating anti-corruption legislation in dealing with particularly large amounts.
This happened in October 2016 when he was detained along with other Deputy Mayor Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
At that time, the Prosecutor ' s Office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both Vice-Presidents.
After that, both officials were resigned.
The Suvorov case was later brought before a court that fully justified politics.
The Walvo Semilarski trial is still ongoing.

However, most fans remain FOR the old version: "Sergey, the old version of the song is clearly 1,000,000 times better!
Support me with the dedicated "Hands Up" fans, "We don't need a "new crumb."

How the CB's decision to reduce the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia has again reduced its key rate.
It fell by a further 0.25 percentage point, up to 4.25 per cent of the annual - formal, historical minimum.
Based on the return of the short step in reducing the rate, as well as the tone of the CB statements and the updated projections for the Russian economy, the regulator is more optimistic about the economic prospects than before.
This means that the current monetary policy mitigation cycle can soon be stopped.
“We have continued to mitigate monetary policy, especially given that the risks of inflation decline remain lower than 4 per cent in 2021”, said the head of the Russian Bank Elvir Nabiullin.
They relate to a significant decline in economic activity, the decline in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, Nabiliulina said, would take more than a year and a half.
It noted, however, that following the lifting of the pandemic, economic processes were revived: energy consumption, consumer demand and investment demand had been restored, construction and production of consumer goods had increased, and annual rates of transport and manufacturing had slowed.
According to the updated forecast by CB, in 2020 the economic decline would be 4.5-5.5 per cent, which was expected to be 4-6 per cent, and the economic recovery growth in 2021 would be 3.5-4.5 per cent, and in 2022 it would be 2.5-3.5 per cent.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the forecast at annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per Urals barrel in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
Previously, CB was expecting $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia ' s inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2 per cent against previously expected 3.8-4.8 per cent.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the mitigation cycle, according to economists for Russia and the CIS, the Renaissance Capital, Sofia Donetec and Andrey Melashchenko.
For example, the Bank of Russia has consistently reduced its key rate for more than a year, and since the beginning of last summer it has dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
At the last meeting, the CB reduced it to one percentage point in June, owing to low inflation rates due to the dwindling demand and the need to stimulate the pandemic and related constraints on the economy.
Chances for monetary policy adjustment persist (at the next meeting on 18 September and before the end of the year), but the limit is close, according to the lead analyst Rosbank Evgeny Kosheev.
The combination of pro-inflation risks also indicates the proximity of a break in interest policy - broken supply chains, a possible increase in costs due to epidemic prevention measures and a faster (compared to expectations) recovery of demand, he said.
To complete the subsequent action of the Bank of Russia, more attention will be required to the inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as the external volatility that has increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts, Koseljev points out.
In any case, a reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in the rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as possibly at the mortgage, says Senior Analyst, Open Bank Analysis Officer Maxim Petrovic.
The rate adjustment would be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he clarified.
The interest rates on credit requirements may fall by a further 0.3-0.6 per cent over the second half of the year, the mortgage rates may end in the range of 6.2 to 7 per cent, not excluding the economy of BSS Prime Minister Anton Pokatović.
The average deposits will also fall by 4.2-4.5 per cent in the coming months (almost higher than 4.5 per cent).
They may continue to fall to 4 per cent if the CB reduces the key rate in autumn, Pokatović believes.
Centralist Party pledges to pay all its debts by the end of the year

- It was a very beautiful story, they immediately gave birth to a child, everything was beautiful and wonderful.
At some point Sasha was covered in all this, and he wanted to go for a little walk.
And if any other woman treats it right (you think she went for a walk, dance a little bit), it's not about Olya.
She can't stand things like that.
And his story about a little walk was that the sister promptly married another person and gave birth to his child.
When Sasha came to his senses from what happened, he couldn't believe it.
He was trying to crawl on his knees, give away diamonds.
His lion's pride blew his head off.
He wanted it all back, and how to get it back, he didn't understand.
They have a friendly relationship, they have a common child, but he still can't get over it.
His destructive behavior is a cry of desperation, an attempt to kill, or attract her attention.

Question: The ruling Union of Farmers and “Green” Lithuania once again spearheads party ratings
Lithuania's Alliance of Farmers and Greens, the leader of the ruling Seima coalition, led the party rating.
This was demonstrated by a survey conducted by the company of social studies of Vilmorus during the order of the newspaper Lietuvos ritas.
After the 2016 parliamentary election, “Christians” lost their first place and for a long time led Russia's main critic in Lithuania, the opposition “Conservation Union” of Christian Democrats (conservators).
However, recently, the President of Lithuania, Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the elective capacity of the parties, said that the Alliance of Farmers and Greens, following the parliamentary elections this year, would likely be able to form a coalition again.
This statement has led to the outrage of the conservatives.
The latest survey showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6% of voters and 17.2% of voters would vote for farmers.
According to Director Vilmorus Vladas Guidis, the gap is in the wrong direction, and yet the rulers have stopped falling behind the conservatives.
According to Guydis, the sociological success of the “Christians” was facilitated by the news that their electoral list would be headed by Prime Minister Saulus Skvernalis.
This politician was the first in the “Christians” list and in the 2016 elections.
Thirdly, the Social Democratic Party, which now stands ready to vote for 7.1 per cent of respondents.
She lost 2 percent unexpectedly for me.
Fourth: Labour Party headed by Russian businessman Victor Uspassky (6.2 per cent).
The remaining political organizations, according to the poll, are still unable to overcome the 5 per cent electoral barrier.

Extra claims for purchases shall be excluded by law
The legislation may establish exhaustive requirements for procurement applications.
In the autumn session, at the plenary meeting, the States planned to consider, on second reading, a bill requiring the content and composition of an application for procurement, to which only small and medium-sized business entities could participate.
The amendments are made by the Government to the Law on the Procurement of Goods, Works, Services by Certain Legal Persons.
The bill was drafted pursuant to a road map for the implementation of the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Strategy in the RF by 2030, approved by the Government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that the contracting authorities are entitled to request from procurement participants, entities of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Also on the list of requirements for those documents.
To date, the Law on Procurement of Goods, Works, Services by Certain Legal Persons is a framework for the procurement of certain types of legal persons.
The requirements for the content, form, layout and composition of the purchase request shall be established by the purchasers themselves in the procurement documentation.
“As a result, the contracting authorities impose excessive requirements on the content, formulation of an application, mandatory presence of certificates, certificates, statements of which are comparable to the deadline for submission of applications, which makes it impossible to participate in such purchases and reduce the number of participants in the procurement”, the bill explains.
The new Bill provides for a comprehensive list of documents that the contracting authorities are entitled to request from procurement participants that are entities of small and medium-sized enterprises.
“The adoption of a document would eliminate arbitrary imposition by the contracting authorities of requirements for the composition and content of applications by participants who are entities of small and medium-sized enterprises”, the explanatory note states.

Once the polygon is closed, it rises to recuperation, and the ground is filled with soil, and degasation and infiltration systems are installed.
This allows chemical processes to be stopped inside the landfill so that it does not become flammable, anger does not develop, poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill continues to rise to be a useless dog in her housing.
Why don't you make her something useful?
For example, in Ruz, where the rectivation of the Annano site was literally completed in the daytime, the authorities are considering making the mountain slope out of the heap.
This range from 1976 to 2016 has grown so that it has gone beyond the land allocated to it.
Therefore, the recuperation had to buy off adjacent plots, de facto already incubated by garbage.
"Sometimes it's going to take a little bit of time for the "sit down," and we're going to think about what we can do to make it useful.
The head of the Russian district, Nikolai Parfenov, told reporters.
Two sites will become renewable energy sites
The Torbejevo Polygons in Lubertsa and Timohovo in the Bogorodsk district will be sites for the extraction of renewable energy from landfill and biological gases.
A gas station capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year will be launched in Torbeeva by the end of the year, which will provide its own needs - the heating of administrative and production facilities.
Timochovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste treatment complex.
A museum may be established at the Kucino Balashiin district, which was closed after the citizens' complaints on the Front Line with the President of the country.
“It was such an idea to establish a museum for the rectification of Podmoskovya sites”, the Minister of Ecology and Environmental Management of the Dmitry Kurakin region announced in advance of the Government.
Israel reported a drone crash in southern Lebanon
The Israeli army drone crashed in southern Lebanon.
The armed forces reported that he had failed “in the course of operational activities”.

For the first time, Furgala's shifter came out to protestors
The Vrio of the Governor of Khabarov Region, Mikhail Degjarev, for the first time after his appointment, went to the shareholders in support of the captured ex-head of the region, Sergey Furgal.
The meeting was broadcast on his Instagram page.
"Moscow hears everyone, so I sent you a scream so that the region doesn't shrink without power... About the Furgal I repeat, he's my friend, the "b" is a single party, "c" -- I'm really worried about his destiny, the party's helping him, he's handing over products, Girinovsky's gonna crash into all the offices," said the governor's deputy.
According to Degtyarev, the Khabarov region cannot be left without a leader, so by decree of President Vladimir Putin, he was appointed to head the region so that “a remarkable building (the government of the province) would function, everything would work, the budget would be spent on social needs”.
The Governor’s Vrio explained that he had not gone to the protesters earlier because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
He therefore broadcasts in social media and reads all the comments to them.
On 25 July, two consecutive protests were held in Khabarovsk.
The rallies in support of the former Governor have been held in the region since 11 July.
Before the next action, Mikhail Degjarev said he would leave town on the day of the rally.
His cortage was stopped by protestors and called for a statement about the fate of the arrested ex-governor Furgal.
Deguerev had previously refused to go to the shareholders.
"There's really something to do with the leader, rather than go out and talk to those who shout at the windows," said the governor.

linking the Vatican and Nazi Germany
This week is 87 years from the date of the Treaty between the Vatican and Nazi Germany.
A document signed a few months after Hitler came to power was the basis on which the relations of the Holy See with the Fascists were built.
One of the contractors was Cardinal Pacelli, who six years before the Second World War became Pius XII.
In Sochi, the body collapsed on a truck cabin, killing the driver.

Beautiful high minarets have only adorned Aya Sophia
Once again, about Aya Sofia, Vladimir Zelinsky's text came up, which, please, must be protested.
First of all, there's a free entrance - hurrah!
I haven't been to Istanbul, but God's house is better than a paid entrance.
Secondly, Muslims took this land as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volgo-Occa River, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up the Church in Grozny) and dropped the apple trees on Mars.
God help you!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Are we all going back?
You don't think there will be any pagans who will need to return their gates to the place where the Decapolis is located?
Thirdly, the Muslims improved the building and invested resources in it.
I mean, it's just like the factories and places that the Lenins took from the bourgeois in their property, they belong to the lenites, Putin and other nomenclature.
They improved everything from the Kremlin to Angara, so it was all theirs by the right of the progressives.
The beautiful high minarets have very decorated Aya Sophia, very much.
There was a stupid nun, she became a stupid nun with beautiful minarets.
Fourthly, there are no “Islamic” and “ Orthodox” civilizations.
There are those who believe, and there are hypocrites, and there are banishments which unite faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
It's the opinion of an official of the British MIDA Toynbi who believes that he is ashamed to think so.
And the believer everywhere is the place of prayer.
And always.
The believer does not pray except where he is asked to be removed, but goes elsewhere and prays there.
But he is a believer, and he is not a defender.
We're hats, not rock stones.

The decision to expand the PPL would not be supported by either UEFA or FIFA
Russian Football Union (RF) President Alexander Dukov believes it is wrong to expand the Russian Premier League (PPL) to 18 teams at present.
“First, it was an RPL decision, but I agree with it, because it is wrong to change the rules after the tournament has been completed.
This violates the integrity of the tournament and the sporting principle.
And certainly this decision would not have been supported by either UEFA or FIFA," Dukov said after the final of the Russian Cup "Zenit" – "Chemki" (1:0).
There are currently 16 clubs in the PPL, but an option has been considered to increase the number of teams to 18.

Kirilenko shared his memories of games with Bryant and Jordan at NBA
The head of the Russian Federation of Basketball (RFB) Andrei Kirilenko shared his memories of his games against the legendary Coby Bryant and Michael Jordan in the National Basketball Association (NBA).
I knew Bryant's self-love couldn't be hit with a thrashing motion to avoid stimulating his sports malice.
Kobi had the killer's instinct, so at the site I tried to talk him out of taking the game with the aggressive key.
I complimented him at the site, saying, "Oh!
Kobi, good shot, great passage!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he almost forgot that he had to take the ball once and pick up three or four more points.
We spoke well with Koby," says Kirilenko, "Weirth Moscow."
He also described his first game against Jordan.
"I baked it.
For the first three minutes of the match, I was running away in total admiration from what a legend I had seen on television alone was near me.
As long as I'm happy in my teeth, Michael's got a lot of points.
Soon I left with the thrills, covered his brooches a few times...
In that game my team won, and Jordan still scored 44 points," added the head of the FBI.
In the NBA Kirilenko held 12 seasons.
He was elected as Utah Jazz Club on the 1999 Draft under a total 24th number.
In addition to Utah, which he spent ten seasons, Russia's Forvard was in favour of Minnesota Timberwulfs and Brooklyn Nets.

On Sunday, 26 July, the interim Governor of Khabarov, Mikhail Degtjarev, was surprised to hear that the region is purchasing Sakhaline gas from the American company Exxon Neftegas for dollars.

I had no idea that such a thing was possible in 2020 in Russia, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Degjarev noted that the issue had been discussed with the head of Minenergo Russia, Alexander Novak, during his visit to Khabarovsk on 24 July.
The governor also stressed that Gazprom had moved to Russian TEC and power by 2025, which meant that Russian gas purchased in the “normal” rubles would be used.
The Sakhalin-1 project is implemented through a product-sharing agreement where the project operator is 30 per cent of Exxon Naftegas Ltd, another 20 per cent of Rosnefti, a Japanese Sodeco 30 per cent and an Indian ONGC 20 per cent.
The Khabarov Region has been acquiring gas from this project since 2005.

At the same time, the American added, and he was intimidated by the reaction of some people to the series's storyline: for example, there was a case where “a man in a deep pool shot down a symphony site and said that it was not true.”
"Then there were a couple of times when we met disgruntled locals who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who came in first with the claims started to help us," he summed up.
The shooting case explains the issue, which took place in Kabardino-Balcaria in September 2019: a drunk man attacked a car by a gun group, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier, it was reported that Olga Baranetz, a public defender for the family, had filed a complaint with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roscomnadzor for the service of more.tv, which posted the Russian series "Chiki".
