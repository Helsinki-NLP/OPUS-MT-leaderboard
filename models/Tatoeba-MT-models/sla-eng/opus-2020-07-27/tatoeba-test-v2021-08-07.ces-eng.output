According to the Tatoeby directives, members are encouraged to add sentences in their native language or translate them from a language they understand to their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to compose a natural-sounding sentence in their native language. When we write in a language other than native language, it is very easy to create sentences that sound strange. Please translate the sentence only if you know for sure what it means.
