It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How do they treat you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take time.
Why don't you go after him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're cold.
We're walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
Do you like the wheel?
He's a bread fan.
I feel like a fool.
Tom doesn't give me enough help.
I'm not gonna use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean to him?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We only met once.
Thanks for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's fire them.
What's it worth?
Our water was so thick.
Tom pretended not to notice Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my father.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He's probably still there.
You looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
Nobody knows that.
The drain was jammed.
Breakfast is from seven to nine o'clock.
Tom came back last week.
Everyone was scared.
I've seen it before.
You made a good choice.
The Nudists consider nudity normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I was kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good wife.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
The wolves stalked the herd.
That song has haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll make it.
Did Tom pay his rent?
This gentleman is an acquaintance of mine.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
The racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you fired a gun before?
I really like that tattoo.
Get a ticket for free.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they been doing so far?
Tom's a mess.
I don't live in Boston.
The government was being sued for damage.
Nobody trusts Tom.
The clock had a guarantee.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
Who did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ring.
Tom was doing what Mary told him.
Show us where you found him.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for that job is great.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom knows he wasn't a good father, so he's trying to redeem himself.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have a confession to make.
Alcohol affected him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom got a little blush in his cheeks.
Nobody cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would have responded reverently.
I have to help him.
He's critical.
You'll understand when the time is right.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit on the ink.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go to a picnic with John.
Don't be cheeky with me.
I think you did it.
We don't come from monkeys, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Who do you usually eat?
I consulted him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It's been going on all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rough.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop abusing Tom.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom was having breakfast later.
Are you helping?
Are you two related?
He likes ham with eggs.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather take the subway than the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did you do your best?
Mary's rewinding the movie.
She has a nice handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom wrote the report himself.
Do you buy one of these?
He doesn't look so good.
Hey, can you give that back to me?
That was personal.
I'd better go too.
Excuse me for a second.
Take off your hat.
Acting is very good.
Please don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I won't be lonely here.
He asked me to look at him.
We'd better not go out on a storm like this.
Took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Should we really eat pizza this early in the morning?
Can you go back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
Would you like to sing?
You're lucky.
My nose flows every time I get cold.
We've met several times.
Nobody liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you can understand.
Everybody's looking for happiness.
Did anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something about her.
Tom treated me terribly in high school.
Tom wore a hat that still cost the price.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
You have to make a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to get help.
That's what the paper said.
Tom said it was an emergency.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom is obedient, even submissive.
Where did Tom open up?
Mike said he'd come.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're cannibals.
Don't make a man with a mold.
She tried to do it herself.
Run!
Is it worth the delivery?
I like tails.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy me those?
You didn't see it like that, did you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
Mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've been putting this off too long.
I don't understand.
That's sad.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you're doing, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We take checks, too.
The newspaper costs a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were witnesses.
You hit one.
Macedonia has four verbic ways: express, conditional, ordered and superior.
They haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The calm surface reflected her lines as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you for a second, Tom?
These pants are right on me.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's quite true.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw the trash on the ground.
I remember when I met the Queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom seemed angry.
What will the Japanese economy be next year?
That's exactly how I got in trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
What do you mean you're not sleeping?
They're giving me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a filling.
I have to think of myself.
I was trying to find him.
It's a big gate.
It's a child's play.
Tom's not mad at you.
I'll be back at six and a half.
Tom's fucking driving me away.
I was only gone an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show has to go on.
Make a good stand scandal.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to do it?
Don't get any attention.
I almost passed out.
Pick your favorite bat.
Is this Jupiter or the bull?
We ran out of gas.
Tom's a trallable girl.
Who do you have on the list?
He has a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait for him here?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought Mary flowers?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with here.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
May I go with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about was food.
Make sure you don't get caught in the mud pit.
They both coughed.
The train went through a tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We didn't wait for them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you want tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the fateful day on which they will try to escape.
Everyone's gone crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom's known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still yes.
I'm here to look for her.
It's totally wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom police already questioned him.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom left.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
Looks like you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got the room moving.
No survivors.
She was supposed to shut up.
I'm not like you!
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They laughed quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I put a slap on his face.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do the trick.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were over a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king was particularly troubled to give speeches because of the heavy speech flaw.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is too heavy.
The weather is flawed.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels tried in vain to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to go to jail than to run away.
He's licking himself.
When are you studying?
Tom had a hard time swallowing his pills.
It is worth quoting a famous passage from his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom is reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by cannibals.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get right on it.
Didn't you hear me shouting?
Take a walk.
Don't eat too much.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Take out the clamp.
I have no plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
You didn't want the prize, did you?
Look at the smoke.
I'm glad you're glad.
They're not honest.
Why can't you go now?
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at the glowing star.
I don't know how to help him.
Buckle up.
Make him confess!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can You Explain Why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert. Your theory sucks.
We went bankrupt.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me a little?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you have to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's not even a Ronka height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded!
We discussed this.
Tom caught the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Let them call me.
The electric heater warms ceramic tiles from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the woods, monkeys came down from the pine trees.
Let's forget about it for now.
Because of his father’s sudden death, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're quickly receiving data.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll resembling the whole thing.
I don't know.
At first, I couldn't stand him.
His sleeve's stuck.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'm gonna stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone's gone but him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's sinking.
Pipes are jammed.
I insulted you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They were knocking next to him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
By mistake, Tom told everyone that I had died.
I think we found one.
The deadline for the reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom is just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on planktons.
We need to get out of here now.
I'm ready to do it.
My water got to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you'll have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia liked the concerts very much.
Invite them to join us.
Where do I park?
Does he care about anyone?
How is that your fault?
Tom's beer from the bottle of wine.
I fell off a wheel.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
Do you mind?
When does this show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are falling apart.
Tom got Mary to donate money.
I got it with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But you lied to her.
I'm not married yet.
Is it deep in the lake?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel very good today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did you ask her for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-phase process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom's running through the bottom.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Mustard's really hot.
We're advertising our products on TV.
I was merciful.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That happened almost thirty years ago.
Tom is too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that before.
You've been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I need to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is anyone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She'll have to leave soon.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
He's been blocked.
Tom's struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, he didn't get what he was hoping for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You have to stay away from him.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfactory?
Tom put his hands out.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says the previous dentist told him he would remove his nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Do not expect everyone to share your opinions.
That's exactly what Tom proposed.
It's acting kind of wrong.
Tom's a smart guy.
The curry powder is a mixture of more spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
It's been a rough night for me.
Tom was driving around the city with his brake up.
Yeah, anyway.
Do you want a camping trip?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to rule Mary out of the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks suspicious.
Keep it to yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty high.
I'm not employed.
My old English teacher must be turning into a grave by now.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly, not realizing that their own conduct is undesirable.
He wears high heels to make it higher.
Do you like bowling?
Sorry, I think you dropped something.
You just need to talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't make any noise.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What difference does it make?
We finally meet, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
You gave up the idea.
I must sound ridiculous.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
You're so stubborn.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have a rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go on a mountain trip.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used inappropriate expressions.
Your coffee is generating energy!
Tom was a nice guy.
It's a big show for football.
Why did you ask me that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom's a skilled writer.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom writes his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They must give up the idea.
Tom's really upset.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all experience her behavior as repulsive.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Avoid it.
His eyes glowed with anger.
Why were you yelling?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
It's possible Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can do anything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You've given your word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "Me too."
There's a lot of birds in this forest.
Please let me stay.
Let's walk.
He was just about to meet me, Tom.
You should ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible Tom is richer than we thought.
I never meant to fool you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have that kind of desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your strain.
Apologize.
Could not find the address of the hotel.
Smoking means suicide.
The hard-wings, butterflies, and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light the fire.
I wanted to bring you this as soon as possible.
What's your hat?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom skinned his knee.
Where did the pinions come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made out of leather.
I need to rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom performed, and the crowd clapped.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but it didn't work.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink sodas.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize the tipon.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Bring her in.
You're cooking turkey with light bulbs.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going, so whatever he wants it to be.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan drank five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking slaughtered.
I know how it sounds.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I'm already feeling much better.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
Too bad the concrete's not burning.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped at once.
My dad used to bring me here when I was young.
What a nerd you are.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should've kept my mouth shut.
I'm a mess.
Tom got here early.
He dried his wet clothes by the fire.
He's always snorting with his English knowledge.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have covers?
No part of the pig has failed.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticking.
What happens next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
The cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened was a rare occurrence.
Tom packed his bags.
What good does that do?
That's very helpful.
Tom had his phone vibrating.
I've decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not going back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl walked slowly.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time.
That didn't go very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't eat lunch.
There's someone behind it.
Since the note was written in French, I could not read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
Room's full.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open my head.
This was Tom's idea.
I decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn't resist.
Tom is still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear that.
Tom made Mary laugh.
That was the main idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom, think about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your necklace.
That doesn't have much priority.
Take this.
How much is it now?
You got it?
I could not help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your pretty eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I'll never capitulate.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first cockroach I've seen this spring.
Do you want to dance?
Why did you fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works at the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems fun.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care!
Linda was sick and suspected of being pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 from the front gate.
The meeting started more than an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do what I know and I can.
I have money.
You can learn here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom, fix it.
Tom threw the arrow.
It's not cocooning.
It's not safe for me here.
Unfortunately for me, Mary came to the party in a delusional dress.
I'll say what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't say anything about anything.
The worst kind of hangover is emotional hangover.
Let's get a grip.
The beekeepers remove the vinegar to collect the honey.
I'm supposed to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget it.
Tom won the fight.
You should have brought them here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom's eyes lit up when Mary stepped into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you have helped us at all?
It might be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat's hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't seem very possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are a lot of big cities in Brazil.
I still haven't solved that puzzle.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he really is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
This isn't blue, this is purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs usually kill them before they reach one year old, so they eat people.
Could you get this arrow out of my leg?
I've forgotten how smart you can be.
Can I see that one?
He's spending all the money in water.
We're not holding anything back.
I guess I just didn't think.
I'm not really sure.
Let's get this over with.
I've told you a million times that you shouldn't exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
The book weighs.
Why should we find her?
I'm just saying be careful.
Tom keeps lying to me.
I hear him in the next room chewing gum!
Did you get scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's take a walk in the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, obviously you have romantic feelings for Tom.
Could not find the lock.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you teasing me?
Please, talk to me.
Angels guard us and guide us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
Therapy didn't help.
My grammar is weak.
Tom was standing by.
Tom's going into town.
I'm interested in Japanese culture.
This is jave.
Who saw me.
Tom's getting close.
Tom's the real hero.
Where'd you come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
It's done.
These goats are naughty.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn't think for a second to try to convince Mary to do it.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his locker.
Maybe we're related.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not the other way around.
Tom sleeps tight.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about it!
He was standing right in front of her.
There's more than one way out.
Tom, you've always been very protective of the kids.
I asked the same question.
We had to look for a place to stay while our house was renovated.
He gave me six lazy slaps.
I'm safe.
Your eyebrows look weird.
That's why I can't help you.
I still haven’t found time to write that report.
I can do it without it.
There are those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
She's getting dressed.
Tom threatened Mary.
Tom couldn't be prevented.
I love walking by the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get off.
We have to find him.
He used me.
What a shame.
Tom's nodding.
I don't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm thirty years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
Do you know how to run?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use my dream.
And the sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Surrender the compound.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was covered in blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you very much, Tom.
This afternoon we'll be eating cherry from Italy.
Tom's from Boston, too.
That's a tough bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I've been gone for three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need sunscreen.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unsocial.
Tonight's fine with me.
They were heading east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand this guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The Ceramics that fell off the roof were torn apart.
Who owns this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped clean the tub.
Come by anytime.
Tom would have kicked us out.
Tom, don't be embarrassed.
Just finishing up the report.
Come on, hurry up, it's an emergency.
You better go.
Tom got out.
I've got two cameras.
What did you find?
Dan confessed to Linda that she was a heavy drinker.
It's on Tom's drawing.
The game is not over.
Tom put his drink down.
They stole my wallet on the bus.
Don't argue with me.
Seems like it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to say.
I'm not here to be of any use to you.
Did anyone get hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
They paid me to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary screaming.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
Amoebas are life.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't have to mean Tom's dead.
The waves create the wind.
Get a clean glass out of the closet.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left a message.
Is that all you saw?
That would be a disaster.
I like how French writes their word for "bubamara".
The lift can lift 20 tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's too risky without any help.
Is that any good for you?
We're pretty good.
Pig's cut to pieces and fried.
Ask a professional face.
I love trips.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom seemed to be trying to convince Mary to do something.
I want to get up and play.
That's kind of nice.
Tom wiped his forehead.
This book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
Gangsters forced a lot of money from the rich guy.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's rather boring.
Your conscience bites you, doesn't it?
I wanted blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that scar on his chin?
Tom had a bruise on his hand.
Get a handkerchief, your nose is flowing.
Tom was going with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeats the question.
They were originally farmers.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do something you're gonna regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely comes out.
We set up a tent.
I didn't think it was gonna rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
I wish he'd stayed.
She has ten children.
Tom threatened me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
Now I'm pretty healthy again.
Tom was still wearing his pajamas and his bathroom when I got here this morning.
We've all read that.
Go this way.
You're backwards.
The sentence is not accurate grammatical.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
They invited me to their wedding.
Are there any other questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary’s first teacher.
There's a fountain in the middle of town.
You have to help her.
The reader will soon realize that my analysis is accurate and that her results are more reliable.
I've tried.
A broken tree was blocking the road.
Don't interrupt Tom.
There were no more blankets.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my attempts have failed.
He's got the best math.
They were so happy together.
I thought you already found a place to stay.
He put his head in my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't have liked that.
Did you see the rainbow this morning?
Tom believes in strange things.
Tom likes to dance.
Tom told Mary he saw John with Ellis.
He hurt me and he called me an asshole.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were passengers.
I think Tom's vain.
Some fish can change their sex.
I can take it from her.
Get some food.
It might be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought you might be able to help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do this.
He's making us work too hard.
Slow down.
He wants every wedding to be the groom and every funeral to the deceased.
Tom's probably fine.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised to see Mary with John.
Have a good night.
I told you the truth.
They offer free condoms.
Wet climate conditions are not specific to the peninsula.
Tom knew Mary would help him.
Tom's never there.
Please do your best.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom pulled out a pen.
Why should I care what you do?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Should we arrest Tom?
How long should this medicine be used?
I don't need a bed.
Put us on Facebook!
Did you buy us anything?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are truly happy do not write down their happiness.
I still don't know what to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please show me more.
I need to paint my house.
We didn't create it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I'm learning English.
Usually what causes the pain?
We're addicted to work.
This box is made of tin.
She dropped the test for a reason.
Trust your gut.
He can't do that.

Just try it.
I like to dance, too.
Tom was a piano teacher.

Is Tom interested?
Here it is.
I want to have a little chat with you about Tom.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know what's best.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never surfed.
I'll find something.
We ate turtle soup.
We can work in the open if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's treasures.
That cake is calorie.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm afraid of death.
Tom seemed a little disoriented.
It was effective.
Tom's alive.
I'm hiding Tom.
We'll be able to sit you down soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
They tell me you know how to do this.
You're experienced.
What's wrong with her?
It's not usually a pen.
The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
They'll pay us well.
Tom seemed upset.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
My car's gone.
I'm not much bluer.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So these are the weirdest prisoners I've ever seen.
This is where I spend most of my day.
Should we wait here?
You come out so naked, you'll catch cold.
Does it still hurt?
It was pretty funny.
I set it up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did you say something tom?
Everybody busy?
They don't want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom got shot.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't resist.
We did a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Hand me the wine.
All the shops are closed.
You've made it white again!
Stop beating your dick.
Tom's done with the dishes.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
Useless drama.
We believe in God.
We need to take what we need to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Did Tom agree with his associates?
That smells like cheese.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you a little advice.
No matter what you do, always do your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report the rape.
Tom is a responsible adult.
I can't call them at home.
You're a racist.
I already forgave you.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
Somehow I still don't believe it.
What's the shortcut?
Thanks again for coming.
They're baiting us.
The wounded soldier was barely walking.
The sun's just rising.
I actually know the answer to that question.

I was beautiful.
I like Tom's discreet humor.
The light bounces off the water.

I'm not fucking with you.
You can ask Tom.

Go back to your seats.
Can I touch you?
Are you missing something?
Sit down and make a man cry.
Do you intend to help him?
We walked through the trees.
I'll do it anyway.
I knew you'd stand on Tom's side.
They couldn't have avoided them.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
I'm sorry I didn't call them.
Pray to God, not to his prophets.
Tom was acting like a date.
We're even with him now.
We're walking to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch this afternoon.
I hate it when you fight.
I should have been more polite.
Slow down, Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
He was watering his lawn.
I'm sorry, but my answer is denied.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is not to give Tom any gift.
Tom was a hard worker.
Tom used to live right next to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She has short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to study.
He went down the slope.
Do you want me to make something up?
I have to put water in the radiator.
I'm going with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's take a look.
The European wants to drink wine.
My husband is a good man.
He's got a lot of debts.
She knows the more important capitals.
What's under the blanket?
Nobody wants to play with her.
Tom to all the drinking tours.
Are you ready to go?
Tom's obviously out of his mind.
Tom came to them.
You think you can trick me?
My name is Ivan.
I didn't think Tom would want to come with us.
It can't be him.
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her performance.
The teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I'm taking my passport.
It was a masterpiece they often talked about.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she gets back.
I don't have a pen.
Who do we have to start worrying about?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom likes vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They've come to the conclusion that the ship has sunk anyway.
Did you buy the cure?
Did Tom drink?
It hurts my job.
The question is who's gonna do it.
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Everybody happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I should call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy pisses me off.
It's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please ask me what it is.
Hey, what is it now?
I'm not ashamed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom is a wunderkind.
He's walking to school.
He's starting to get inside our heads that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very condescending.
Now the question is, what do we have to do?
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
Ended up fourth of 56 runners.
Don't make any noise.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a kid, he obsessed himself with the girl who lives on the other side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom's forgetting.
Sounds very good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom irritated Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my chambers.
They didn't act fast.
I'm weak.
Wear a loose sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever unless someone kills them.
I wouldn't want to mess with Tom.
They'll never get you into that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Is he looking for Tom?
Here's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't called.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
These animals are under threat.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned to look at her.
Don't you dare ask them that.
That can't be true.
Tom's done.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has tremendous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We heard carefully so that we would not miss a single word.
I already have plans this weekend.
Why are you so upset tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We're exaggerating.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late to make up for it.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are hilarious, and they get even better once he's had a few beers.
You have lovely eyes.
You don't know business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yeah, it'll be fixed... when the willow gives birth to grapes.
Tom's a consultant.
Can I talk to you for a second?
He insulted me by calling me an ass.
Since when does he have fireworks?
Maybe Tom's lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing you do.
I didn't betray anything.
Just yesterday I thought of you.
I know where to look.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It's impossible for him to give up smoking.
My hair is falling.
The big question that no one has found to answer, including me, despite 30 years of research on the female soul, is, "What do women want?"
I tried to pretend to be something I'm not.
Villagers reap harvest.
Tom's not gonna like that.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the break-in?
I can work anywhere I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've looked everywhere.
What was the object?
Every time we split up, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Are you sick of me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was hilarious.
Tom needed some advice.
My laser printer also knows how to scan pictures.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe her?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that painting is.
Everyone's up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
What are you guys talking about?
Hold my luck!
The concert is over with the national anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not gonna move.
Wait a second.
I've got something to do.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He ran as fast as he could.
I won.
Every shade is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
No comment.
I think he's hiding something.
I hope there's enough air in here.
She married zero from a man.
The wind is down.
Nothing's changed.
You don't have to wear anything this way.
The old man precipitated before he died.
I don't like this book.
Lucky I hit him.
What would Tom be looking for that for?
The sun is a star among billions of others.
I've got the haystacks.
Can someone help me?
We'll go this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you Google her?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
This mystery is solved.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have much to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, there's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's true for me.
Are you sure we shouldn't make an appointment first?
One who can hear the butterflies laughing knows how the clouds taste.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
He wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't deal with them.
They pulled lots to see who'd go first.
I gave him a chance.
You've got a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
No hope.
It's not for yftar to eat like goods!
But if I were in Brazil, I'd be a lot more afraid.
Have you ever worked as a bartender before?
Did you forget that again?
I don't like it at all.
I just got off work.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I've got the flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food is cooled, heat it up in the microwave.
The stream is to the right of us.
Tom's not an old man.
This seems too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he saved.
I think now is the time to leave.
This guy's a bandit.
Tom might have seen it.
Tom's knocking a little.
Tom is very immature.
What are they up to?
How's the volume on the cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he was drinking.
I like your company.
Tom, you have to stop.
Tom likes a rematch.
Tom stuck a fork in the box.
Will I be replaced?
I need to get us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
Whales are kind of mammals.
Dan waved Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom seems stressed out.
Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, but you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
He's getting ready to roll.
This will greatly facilitate our work.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would he leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings were not returned.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of funeral marches.
We're probably lying to each other.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, tell me, and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this.
Roll up your sleeves.
I can't believe we actually did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
I'm good at that.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a bunch of questions.
Who's running things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It's gonna get a little late.
What are you drinking?
The way it came, it went.
His legs were numb.
Tom picked up his keys.
It's all stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on the map?
Tom is unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom went to the Midget.
Look forward.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Is Tom bothering you?
This is my latest review.
I've been sick for two days.
This hose is garbage, it's too thin.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a mule and a donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
Coming out of the rain doesn't come under consideration.
I'll have them go right now.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I got an ace.
There was no living soul in town.
I think you know who I am.
Haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Would you like to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was hitting Mary with a rotten egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take it from here.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes sense.
I set them up.
What are some of the symptoms of mushroom poisoning?
And what are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I like watching lesbian porn.
And who are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John writes his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that keyboard chord?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom was worried right away.
I don't have feelings for her.
I guess I was expecting a little better.
I already do.
He's writing a letter to his mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom pretended to be surprised.
It was impossible for the boy to swim the river.
Tom was here earlier than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old cabin has a certain charm.
This topic is taboo.
We barely escaped.
Did they hire you?
It's leaky gas.
Tom could see Mary sending messages.
You'll feel better.
Tom was a little stoned.
Let's do this right.
You can cruise all year in Hawaii.
Tom was motivated.
You might have to help us.
Most think that computers will never be able to think.
What a coward I am.
Brother, you can't just walk up to a woman and scratch her -- that counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her I loved him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's sedated.
You can't do what you think.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
You've been smoking a lot.
I'm a patient man.
It's not happening here.
It is better to be optimistic and cheat than to be pessimistic and right.
The water was milky.
I'm waiting for the light to change.
The boy was silent.
The hull of the ship is divided into more watertight parts.
Since you've been cooking, I'll wash dishes.
Let's just leave the subject.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They've been attacked.
You can't lose your temper.
He's got fake eyelashes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear the knock?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Oh, no!"
He's not the shy guy he was anymore.
You got it?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I need to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
There were boys all over the group, some were playing jamming, some were playing ball, others were riding a wheel or riding wooden horses.
Doubts destroy friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk left in the bottle.
We both should go.
The pain that causes love is sweeter than any pleasure.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We're gonna find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
The energy is coming from inside.
Nobody believes them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
You hit your head.
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Put the seat back.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom's getting angry.
I don't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom buy Mary?
I don't know how it got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm mad.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
It's hard to make new friends.
It's weird how people in the tropics eat spiced food like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom had no family.
I can't determine what the baby wants, because it points to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Although he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom's got a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go pick up Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim's never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a fake lead.
Tom fought.
I said he might turn up.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like that has happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Do you know how to fix a bathroom?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're handcuffed?
I'll give her another chance.
Tom's been with me all morning.
Her skirt has a bow on one side.
Let's eat something.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing fine.
She can neither read nor write.
Tom, you hurt your leg.
Get in there.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We've all noticed that.
You have very pretty lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
Nobody came with me.
I know Tom will eventually get out of prison.
The most expensive thing is the land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom, you've made a list of things to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is sour.
We ran out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why do you object?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father, he's my father-in-law.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Calculate how much money we're gonna need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much is that over there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you getting up at six o'clock?
Tom sat down again.
What country is Boston in?
Tom is very strong.
Tom spends too much time on his computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I had pneumonia, I was just combustating in my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me right now.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean.
I had a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom sees something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You heard the man.
Tom's got a headache.
Oh, no.
There's nobody here.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
He did his best.
He's a glutton.
First, let's talk about what Tom has to do.
My mom buys me a toy.
I'm not taking that chance.
This house needs repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a errand boy.
Tom's not listening.
They want everything you've told them you're gonna give them.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something about him.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, women and men are quite different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the answer?
Is that necessary?
Tom's behind.
I'll never give you up.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well dried up.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Perhaps it would be best if you called them.
Some people don't like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I gonna do?
Does he bark at your dog?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German doughnuts.
We were eighteen at the time.
I make $13 an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I love broccoli, but I hate cauliflowers.
I don't like seeing him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran away.
Keep doing that.
This is repulsive.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he doesn't know what Mary wants to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
They got you drunk.
Tom started to feel sorry for himself.
I think you should choose her.
You're being polite.
You're gorgeous.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out the candles and make a wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom cruelly looked at Mary.
Tom was wearing a hoodie.
Tom looks determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended not to know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you done yet?
How long has it been?
It's not getting any worse.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joke.
I've been much worse.
Tom's trying to stay calm.
I use that computer.
Tom used to be thin.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
I only had one glass.
Nobody writes to me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I ask.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom is my problem.
Tom's mom told him not to talk with his mouth full.
Everyone's in control.
Every customer has his rights.
I'm only calling you as much as I can hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What did you do last time?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
This statement is wrong: I'm going to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
They're obsessing us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't get invited to parties often.
He doesn't look anything like his dad.
Tom's not very tough.
It was after midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Did you change the shampoo?
Tom looked around, didn't expect anything to happen.
They convinced me to give up smoking.
You can take your coat off.
I don't think they followed me.
They have no defense.
He often helps others.
Tom's a big pessimist.
You're entitled to a phone call.
Skiing was actually much more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's go get that guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I don't want to get in trouble.
Their friendship quickly grew into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'll stop.
I turned the lamp on.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out the form.
I don't imagine fun like that, but whatever you want.
Do you think Tom would want to come with us?
Yoga comes from India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom buttered his toast with butter.
We have work to do.
I heard him sniff.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives over there on the hill.
I'll accept anything.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It'll be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom seemed used to such problems.
You're gonna be okay.
Everything was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the fly.
You rarely went there.
Tom's stiff.
Let's sing and dance.
After the war, the winners are always right, and the defeated are guilty.
Tom and give Mary a doll.
The translation of jokes is quite difficult, if at all possible.
This has been an arena day.
I bring bad news.
This isn't helping.
Overcome weakness.
How many push-ups do you do every day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
Do you happen to have a key?
Let's be realistic.
Lemon tea, please.
Tom doesn't have a job.
Maybe this will help.
I hate him just as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body was drenched with alcohol.
Tom's healing.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is difficult.
I'm not leaving with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a little joint.
I'll make sure we finish the projects in time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
Music is universal.
You squeeze too much when you shake hands.
And if we don't find them?
Don't let me come get you, Tom.
You won first place in the game.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan was smoking marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
Yesterday she stayed late.
You're dirty.
Everyone was quiet.
What exactly happened between us?
What's wrong?
You gave up the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How do we find them?
Maybe it's acting weird.
No one can be saved from death.
It won't help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble many times.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I just want you to come back here to Boston.
Democracy encourages freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You're gonna need a ticket to travel by bus.
We're very pleased.
Is that all we need?
He was desperate for health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom has earaches.
Dan got hit in the head with a hammer.
Who gave you that idea?
What was Tom doing?
You're in the middle of a nightmare.
It's not a good time right now.
You don't have any more alcohol.
When are you leaving?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom's become famous.
It's stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.
What's on your mind, Tom?
Your mother's advice would be superior to your friend's.
We have not yet escaped the danger.
Tom's freaking out.
He's been waiting ten minutes.
She was wearing a vest.
Dan's looking for the police right now.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him over there.
Monday is the first day, Tuesday the second, and so on.
They're moving fast.

You're not gonna command me, man.
Did you ask him to leave?
Tom has three uncles.
What a beautiful sight!
Tom has a plan for everything.
Don't get fed up.
Tom needs to relax.
I'm jealous of Tom.
What else did you expect?
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
I'm gonna get stronger.
This elephant worships little children.
Thank you so much, Tom.
This is difficult for her.
Mary put on lipstick.
She's got a picture.
She swims a lot.
The flowers are wringing.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise you.
This is so annoying.
We need more American slang on Tatoeba, now!
We're sorry.
Maybe Tom's gonna be scared and then he's gonna quit.
Is this seat taken?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don’t thank me yet.
I want some tea.
I wouldn't want to get in any way.
Nobody wants to sit with you?
It would be really nice to keep your mouth shut.
Tom thought Mary was a bad influence.
Where's your gun?
Tom wants to do it.
It wasn't easy for us.
I was a passenger.
I'm flying from school.
I often heard him play the trumpet tune.
Unsatisfying libido is what produces all art and literature.
This is really hard for them.

Stick to the plan.
If you get hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me.
She's complicated.
Make sure the gas's off.
Would I take part in this event?
There's almost no coffee left in the cellar.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written a few books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I prefer coffee to tea.

I'm sleeping on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you give Tom a message?
He flirts so aggressively that women eventually run away from him.
Tom set the curtain on fire, by accident.
Did you talk to Tom?
It is difficult to understand self - injury if you have never felt the need to practice it.
This is gonna hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's night.
Pressure's rising.
Tom responded immediately to Mary’s question
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom's been driving that car for three years.
Can the morta be used in dishes?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them?
Tom started dreaming.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom salts his salad.
Tom is the leader.
Save Tom.
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy right now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They don't have a choice.
No one will find me.
Tom is very angry.
In what situations would I use it?
Can't we start from the beginning?
Unfortunately, you're gonna have to do this without someone else's help.
We're all threatened.
Tom won't like him.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom sighs.
Take Tom's weapon.
Look back.
Tom hasn't been back in three years.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Do you do any sports?
Tom, meet your new nanny.
He's afraid of getting lung cancer.
I'm so cold.
Tom played the piano for three hours straight.
I got quality.
Did anyone find anyone to babysit the kid?
I'm quiet.
He was chasing the thief.
It was an extraordinary experience.
Tom chuckled out loud.
Does it matter which one of these I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Do you intend to help me?
The current government has many problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
I'm not gonna say anything.
It would be good.
Quick on foot.
Tom's very stingy.
That's what I said.
Tom has a butler.
Dan got Linda to safety.
They're my cousins.
It's eleven o'clock.
I'm a homosexual.
Tom, think about it.
We shouldn't have let her go.
The man is wrong.
I can't wait to find out what kind of gift Tom prepared for me.
I've seen him face-to-face.
I love all my children equally.
I'm not gonna do what you're asking me to do.
Tom seems pissed off.
What do you know?
Whose picture is this?
There's no substitute.
The hypochondriac invents diseases where they're gone.

I slept on the bus.
The rainwater evaporates when it's warm.
Ask him to wait till I get there.
Her son is a genius.
I lost my manual lamp.
It looks very well written.
That was the whole point.
Tom must still be at school.
I never say anything, even though it pisses me off.
You're below his level.
It's my turn to be early.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
Tom might hire Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom for this.
Tom is very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you going back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
Please, air the room.
Tom is still trying to get Mary to accept the job.
How much of our bodies are water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very clever.
Please help me welcome Tom.
You're very smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don't stay longer than five minutes.
If the time was running, the radioactivity was dwindling.
Should we believe that?
Why did you get so dressed up?
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I don't need to convince him.
Tom's sitting behind Mary in French class.
How can you help her?
Tom got lured into a trap.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to chemistry, we have plastic.
What brings you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.
You're a faggot.
What are you up to?
Why are you being mean to me?
I can't read without my glasses.
I don't mind helping.
Nobody's done anything else.
I'm sorry to barge in like this.
These books are new.
Thank you for inviting us.
Tom erased the dishes.
That was rejected.
I'm not asleep anymore.
Tom made a pretty good statement.
They must be worried.
I've got him.
That gave me an idea.
The fed in the watch broke.
I asked about him.
Tom says Mary likes you.
Come on, everybody.
This is a good place to park.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom's not very old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
That's his job.
I wish I had the camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You have to do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You have to protect the child.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabbed a weapon.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's have a good time.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always makes me feel better.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you buy something to eat?
Boston is a great city.
Look at me.
How many liters of oil does he collect in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
There may be another world.
We don't have anything you want.
This one's green.
Tom repented what he said to Mary.
Go find him.
He's in the basement.
Tom's getting restless.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'm gonna scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom, you brushed your hair.
They all sat down.
He gently touched her.
Maybe we should turn around and come back.
I don't like walking.
She seems a little young to be married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're about to begin.
His brother is more patient than he is.
No one could prove anything.
What kind of hobbies do you have?
So, I'm serious.
No talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do it.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Shall I give you a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write Tom a thank you note.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light's faded.
Come on!
And if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wanted to have breakfast in bed.
Dan's walking his little dog.
It had to be done.
I flipped the lamp.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's exactly what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's testimony.
That's pretty close.
We were worried about you.
Experience doesn't inherit - everyone gains their own.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
This fabric stretches a lot when washed.
The truth is the goal, not the destination.
I'm hiding him.
Have you heard of him?
Tom started talking.
I escaped from class.
Tom is still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without bait, it'll be hard for me to fish.
Tom was taking a nap.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces inhibition.
Tom needs two help.
I'll tell him to go now.
Tom seems confused.
Nobody wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her pupils were black and deep like the abyss.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him a little more with the kids.
Everybody's got drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He's a hard critic.
I was curing the cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten something?
We played basketball in the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn the radio on, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a really good place.
I have a lot to do.
I'm here to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim because it was cold weather.
That's not necessary.
I just wanted the situation to clear up.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll get back to you.
It doesn't get to Tom's house this time.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life away from the Himalayas.
Tom's out.
Please repeat.
You're very dramatic.
Tom licks himself.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She had gone to school.
They say Maria Antoinette was responsible for the French revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's cool.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We tried.
But it's cool!
We're like brothers.
Let me make you something.
You've got too much work to do.
Could that be Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He was voted mayor of Boston.
Police found shoe prints at the crime scene.
I asked him the same question.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom saved the letter.
Tom would like that.
She ran out half naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is, who's gonna tell him?
Tom to Mary was sitting.
Tom can't be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What will you give him?
Is that Sarcasm?
Tom's a vortex.
I'm gonna have to try to deal with this alone.
They've probed the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than 30 messages yesterday.
Are you sure this isn't about making diamonds?
You let Tom get away.
What Is the Answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls wearing high heels.
Dream you know.
I looked at her.
A great crowd gathers together.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
The weather in April is immeasurable.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you crazy, people?
I'm warm.
Tom was the boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.

We're friends with him.
I may admire others, but I never dared to be anything other than what I am.

I've always loved a dog.
You're perfectly safe.

Now you can't help us.
Do you know how much that costs?
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
They were after you.
Let's go down the street.
There was no living soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I don't dig wells.
I still have a few minutes left.
Hold on a second.
Tom loves you so much.
You're a good cook.
There's no shortcut to the top, just the break-in.
Tom's pretty weak.
Its surface was as flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom gets paid a lot.
It was sad.
You seem to care about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Automobiles are now spread out.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's got chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I waved Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I must be punished.
Who ate my lunch?
The Orgular was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you can help me.
His aunt eats an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do as I show you?
I'm making eggs.
I like blue.
The girl freed the bird.
I didn't tell you to take bribes.
Don't sugar my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a stuffed bunny.
I think we should help him.
If there is no pornography with it, it will be done.
I've been ringing for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play a bagpipe?
They chose her well.
What does all this mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a pleasure spending the night with a smart, funny and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of her parents' control.
Tom's a mess.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you were gonna text me tonight, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess.
He's undressed to take a bath.
The river of sweat started pouring down my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just drop it.
I'm learning math.
The pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How did you make out?
Movies are a great time.
I didn't see anything at first.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love jazz.
They're staring at you.
I would do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests can we expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everybody smiled.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
Our flight was canceled due to adverse weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patiently.
The singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
It's possible they'll come back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board is against it.
The world lights up the sun.
His argument was logical.
Get over here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'm gonna go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom had made a tree.
Oh, that's great.
Avoid bad associations.
The airport is nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
It's not coming out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to look after Mary.
Mary wants to drink hot coffee and Tom wants to drink hot coffee.
I gave you a fake address.
I went down.
I'm not angry anymore.
There's a lot of chance Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I care what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom's giggling.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
Why would I need a lawyer?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'm really gonna try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where's Tom buying it?
It looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can anyone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's all quiet again.
It's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Take your clothes off.
I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help.
Tom's having a hard time with his anger.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new man.
Bring me a drink.
I think I'm cold.
The question is whether or not it can.
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom will kill me when he finds out what I've done.
He's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls who were lower than you.
I have to tighten my seat belt.
Tom was about to collide with Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get burgers.
You've probably seen worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is no place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He built a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing up.
I'm getting weaker.
Cake looks nice.
Did someone break your heart?
That's how I feel.
What made you sad?
We want to see Tom.
Where have you been, Tom?
Who won the prize?
Please come on time.
The Germans have a mild attitude toward nudity.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they laid his body in a large grave.
Women like men with mustaches.
Did you forget your wallet again?
Do you accept the tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do it, then who?
I wish I could have been like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunder.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I never got lucky.
His body was stained with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I'm really freaking Tom out.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The island’s inhabitants are friendly.
Let's try it first with Tom.
I've always preferred mysterious characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's with the hat?
Tom is one of America's most prominent songwriters.
There can be no coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't bother Tom.
Tom will never come back here again.
Nobody likes knuckleheads.
She cried for a toy.
He tried to climb a distant mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom's pretty banged up.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We got here first.
I already gave her your number.
My soap burns my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom really liked Mary.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This isn't the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're a fast learner.
We ate very nice food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got beat up.
No one's gonna bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought stinky garbage bags.
I'm suffering from asthma.
He got used to working in the garden two hours a day.
Tom rarely comes out.
Tom caught malaria traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where he hid Tom's diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're really strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
That's a good memory.
Can he do whatever he wants?
The time has come for us to say good-bye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really warm.
We bring them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I planned to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom's still not quite aware of what happened.
Cocaine's a drug.
This is a little harder.
You seem to already know the answer.
Could you take us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns this ship?
Yeah, so?
I asked where Tom was.
It was of great use to us.
What do you usually do in your spare time?
I'll come and save you.
I've got a pebble in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We've had sex.
Who made the doll?
I haven't lost hope for a moment.
Her long hair was masculinely brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please give him a chance.
I never ask for a handle.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't go in my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't mean to brag.
You didn't need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's his purpose?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got some doughnuts.
I'm studying French.
Don't let me see you.
It was too late.
I live on the bottom floor.
Girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to make them stop.
I enjoyed Tom's wits.
We need to call Tom.
They're gonna hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's leave him alone.
I never wear suits.
The heater's broken.
He's gone.
His clients make up mostly poor people.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why does that bother you?
Tom says he wants to do it too.
Women like men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I don't give a shit about them.
People die all the time.
That nickname fits him perfectly.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
She's ruining her clothes.
He pulled out his sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom's reluctant to go.
Tom seems a little down in the morning.
Nobody understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom kicked the mule.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss the subject with you.
Did you ask them for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works at the bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Pass the onion.
We're old friends.
Tom took his hat off and bowed politely.
That's one reason.
Give me back my book, I need it again.
Mark thinks he's a skilled writer.
Tom looked.
My ears are buzzing.
I take the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very neat.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a loser!
Who makes his breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom is complex.
Tom didn't want to bow.
Tom got suspended.
They were getting together.
She's going to be a teacher.
I have no intention of telling Tom that.
I'd like marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom seems distracted.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That is all we know about them.
Do you think that's what's bothering us?
We might find help in the nearest village.
We hope he's okay.
You're capable, but you're slacking.
He works at the embassy three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
We might have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom became violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this yourself.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's furious.
It's work.
We'll figure it out.
Commendation moves students to work more seriously.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom, open the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom's about 30 years old.
What's the matter?
I can see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two men.
Tom measures on the scale.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom's changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom's up his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken up.
He's fucked.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title “Lady ” was used only for nobility.
Tom's been learning French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How do you choose a man just one?
I'm here to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I came to help you.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on the bloodbed, with a dagger buried deep in his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
They pay me to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't have been safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be so proud.
You used to be so funny.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I'm listening to the kid's laugh.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are forging something.
Just leave us alone.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins fights.
You can handle this.
Did you hear those thunderbolts go off?
Don't mix business and pleasure.
I work in Boston now.
Put a crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy with his job.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent's off.
This is one of mine.
Nothing stops us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got up out of the couch.
Don't piss Tom off.
I turned the fan on and I directed it towards the wall.
This is a home jam.
Tom asked for Mary’s help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's corpse in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not entirely true.
Rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you some water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm getting tired of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as he saw him, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked inside.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank lent a million dollars to the company.
I still have a lot to tell you.
I always write myself down.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what matters to you, and I will do my best to destroy it.
Play it easy.
My son always interrupts me when I speak.
This is Tom ringing.
I'll drive myself.
Looks like I had too much to drink last night, my head's falling off, and I'm so hungover.
Tom was having a good time.
Tom said he didn't remember his name.
I'm gonna grab onto your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have an interesting book to lend me?
Tom was moving carefully.
Just get in there.
He claimed a sword from steel.
I moved to a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I've said my own thing.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose.
When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom's an only child.
The woman calls her husband.
Tom really found something interesting.
They had so many more of us.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't believe you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
The day is furious.
I don't even know which one is which.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What is their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are as follows.
This is the pool where Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to meet me at the post office.
What college did you study in?
It's about integrity.
Please don't fire my hand.
I better call him again.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't fuck with Tom.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
A blood vessel broke in my eye.
That's where Mary visited yesterday.
You overdid it!
He's got a son who's gone missing.
I'm trying to work.
What kind of taste do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a feeling the show's gonna give up; they didn't sell a lot of cards.
Tom's coming.
Tom doesn't think he should use deodorant.
Does he often swim, Tom?
The girl's asleep.
Go do your homework.
Don't make the kid eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're a laughing stock.
Tom paid me.
It's my job to read books.
He was executed.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted a lot of kids.
Tom seems like a mess.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Give me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has his own flaws.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what Mary was planning to make for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I got the impression it's been raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom seem upset?
They'll probably come with a car.
I'm grateful.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Even though Jane had one less suitcase than I did, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live at all?
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do it right now.
I can't sleep with the light on.
There's too much acid in the orange.
Tom came to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he was gonna pour the pot.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please don't add any comments.
That was Tom's only flaw.
Do you remember what you wore when I met you?
Lightning is usually accompanied by lightning.
Tom likes cinnamon tea.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I go with Tom?
Tom looks nervous.
I've got a little fever.
Tom knocked him to the ground.
There's no end to this teaching!
The glasses are in the glass cabinet.
Give us some time.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to hook up with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while riding a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom is British.
John and Eve are best friends.
I'm as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the shrink.
How do you still not sleep?
Everybody knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing it.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They were making love.
I set fire to the waste.
We both saw him.
That would be rude.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two annual times in tropical areas.
I think I made a pretty good point.
I'm replacing it.
Look at the watch.
Isn't this wonderful?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm back with my ex-boyfriend.
Just do this job.
I think Tom is wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he can play tennis, but he doesn't.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign say over the door?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
My hair and how my head is held reminds me of Mary.
Don't get in my way.
Now we're looking for them.
My shoes are soaked.
Tom would have returned.
She always works hard.
Which country are you a citizen of?
The trade in ivory is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'm meeting Tom.
I prefer cats' dogs.
There's still a little room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still can't swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom is the father.
You know what I need.
You can't handle this heat.
These two seem to have settled down.
I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
I need you right away.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't have any money broken.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I made this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't mean it like that.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Keep up the good work.
When do you close?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you might say.
Can not get message: %s %s
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go looking for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to the party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you doing in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I am still concerned about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree is sailing.
We'll keep in touch.
We're doing almost everything together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary yelling at John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits long.
Go with crutches.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everyone was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
Louder.
Back then, the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was depressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought he had bigger tits.
Maybe soon I'll be ready to go.
Tom doesn't know how to feel.
There's still some tea in the tea room.
I must have parked my car elsewhere.
Buddhism — Religion or Philosophy?
The noise made me nervous.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was everything just a dream?
I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," the blind man said.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a priest.
I'd like to see the warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is he like that, Tom?
I'm having sinus problems.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom ran out of water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She skilfully handles a saw.
Turn it off.
I don't share my real name on any website.
You've forgotten the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I have three children.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been raining for a week or so.
He's slowly recovering from the disease.
I want a whirlpool.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom seemed really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's in the attic.
Her face was crushed with sperm.
Tom's fair.
This is what you need to do first.
We met around noon.
I don't feel like doing anything tonight.
Bring him a drink.
Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm very confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so they ordered him to leave the firm.
I'd understand what it was about you.
Tom strives to become a teacher.
Have a nice week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom needs to leave now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why do you blame them?
It's too expensive.
We're being childish.
Tom was a barefoot.
Tom would love this.
Tom, get up there.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer, but I don't remember what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what's started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
The nail pierced the tire.
We made wood.
This is much better.
I'll make her chop your lawn.
Tom's good at math.
Tom pulled his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom has always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're Brooke.
Your sons are quite handsome.
I know how much it's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We've been eating lobster and we've been eating lobster.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They broke through the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the other night.
That is so horrible.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them an apple.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I don't have any use for it.
It's not working yet.
Give me an example.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Were you honest?
The cup was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't give in.
They're getting close.
Mom and Dad aren't coming with me.
The vampire came to life in the coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've done my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be submitted?
Tom's got a bruise on his eye.
Tom's firm is compromised.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't get back to you.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.
When I came by this morning, Tom was still in his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror is clouded in the bathroom.
Tom was taking pictures.
Tom thought Mary was gonna be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough money on me right now.
"Vegetarian?" "No, are you?"
Lightning hit the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
It's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They've raised my salary again.
I'll never get there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom's got a job to do.
What should we do today?
Do you believe in horoscopes?
I know how to go.
I'm contributing.
It was such a disaster!
Tom's good at his profession.
I've got it all figured out.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from my list.
Tom put all this together.
I'm not betraying her.
Flowers attract bees.
The water's milky.
Before that, there was no plant life in this climate.
You're incompetent.
What was Tom's answer?
You will do as I command.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a shot.
I did the right thing.
Tom's very far away.
Tom wants to write.
Tom is very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, so?
I have a great interest in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not trained to do that.
She's got tight hips.
I don't ovulate.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Are they going to arrest me?
Unfortunately, it violates all the rules.
What are you doing here?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Come on, beer.
There's a certain Mr. Kimura on the line.
Men and women are men of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound was dropping manure.
No, and he's not even under the chair.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't resist.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must feel lonely.
What did you ask for on the Internet?
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
Our solar system is constantly moving.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw Mary the documents on the desk.
Tom did this.
I'm learning art history.
I don't think so.
What's on the agenda?
There's plenty more.
Looks like these two are back together.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're aliens.
The moral choice is for the translator to translate something or not. Certain things are better left in the language he produced.
You're nasty.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to ask Tom's permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Look around.
Hand me the French key.
Tom seems upset.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom got the lottery.
I'm delighted with Tom's courtesy.
Tom has no hope.
Tom wears glasses.
I'm gonna keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun is constantly variable.
That's exactly what Tom told me.
Tom looked Mary deep in the eye and smiled.
It was very stifling in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
Everything's fine.
The stars are glowing.
Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's white.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
That you found them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be famous once in a while.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait anymore.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're drifting.
We'll go shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom's a wanker.
I just caught my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would he lie to you?
He has a passive personality.
She could have been followed.
My wife was here once.
It's a medicine in powder.
We went up the coast.
I don't want you to bully them.
Depends on your decision.
That's doable.
Tom's overreacting.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
Tom measured you.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're so cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
She was delighted to meet her great - grandson.
It's our best chance.
Smells like flowers.
Tom's distraught.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed the fire extinguisher and started squirting.
She's good for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak for yourself.
He's been doing a lot of hard work.
She slowly developed hatred for me.
I don't think they're good enough for that.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
Well, didn't we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't resist.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
My computer's frozen.
My grandmother used to live with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
And so the conscience really makes us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You were wrong.
We're glad to see you.
Now you're free to leave, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen emits a green light.
English has become my favorite subject.
Things happened fast.
Where's the evidence?
When we woke up this morning, we faced terrible news.
The wound on his knee is now festering.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary got scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't throw anything.
Tom's a farm worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom can hear you.
Who's Tom sleeping from?
It's our job to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs some rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like some mint candy?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
This is where I get off.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
A blood vessel burst into his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't an easy person to get along with.
I don't want pork.
She wants to run.
I need a sea berry.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom reread the note.
The kids were drawing pictures on the chalk sidewalk.
You wonder what took you so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I should take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom married at 26.
We've already cleared that up.
Do you want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, and it's not under the chair either.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he hears something.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Tom doesn't seem to get what's going on.
Come visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to boast of the magnificent chandeliers in the house.
I'm not a local.
What do you got in the bowl?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now?
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
Who's your favorite nail polish?
I'm studying piano.
They need the money.
He swims well.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came in.
You're not following.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's quite common, actually.
I've decided to forgive them.
I know you do.
Did I do something to piss me off, Tom?
The triangles don't have four angles.
There's not enough light to read here.
Tom's counting on Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned her lipstick off.
Guess what.
Tom is ashamed of me.
Guess what you told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've looked everywhere.
I'll do the talking.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon's coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
You found your parents.
He gave us a questionable answer.
Wake me up as soon as it's dark.
Mr. Gorbachev, bring down this wall!
Tom seems startled.
Tom's stepping up.
It's the way it's supposed to be.
Let's try to get along.
That's gonna be hard.
I don't feel like retiring.
Thanks for asking.
I have a good reason not to like Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll investigate that right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are deserted.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter was not to be sent at all.
The girl wearing the scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom will fight much.
What are you talking about?
I'll get him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince inherits the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so loved.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's nothing urgent.
I'll pick it up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I don't give a shit about all of you.
I'll take the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
Tom doesn't like me very much.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom will be here.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom's going to school with a car.
Did you see that?
I'll have to think about this carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everyone's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Do you write the proverbs?
It was a great show.
We should go find them.
The last time I was home on Friday night was when I was 13.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think is gonna change.
That's what I do for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
Just make me sick.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
Tom's just so mad.
Tom's going to sleep.
To protect our peace!
Tom's well-armed.
We took care of each other.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm unarmed.
Do you hate them that much?
We have to buy him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to fill my thirst.
Tom got here on time.
It's boring TV today.
Oh, great!
Tom found a four-leaf clover.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She quit smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got to say goodbye to them.
Have you been smoking?
All visitors must be examined.
Where'd you get that scar?
You're nothing.
We're not gonna find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds totally valid.
It's awesome!
The water penetrates the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom has arrived safely.
I can stay.
I don't see any customers complaining.
Here, I like challenges.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should have done it yesterday.
We're a lot like Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Beware of sparks flying from the hearth.
It's just made up.
Tom kept Mary quiet all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I dream about you all the time.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's get a soul.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam that's coming up.
We're going to Boston.
Tom's a good father.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her passionately in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three cans of bug spray.
It was disgusting.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my father.
Kids love cakes.
He was quite restrained.
I can handle Tom.
Tom gets upset.
This is from us.
In case of emergency, what number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't even touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary got Tom all the money.
Enough of this nonsense.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to your place.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
That looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom started whining.
The butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got out of work earlier.
We have everything.
I baked him these cookies.
When does the school year end?
You're right from the start.
How did you do it without our help?
Why didn't you say bye?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be forgeries.
Beauty cannot be established objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom is unstoppable.
His girlfriend's weak.
Between me and Tom, it's over.
Tom didn't know what Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
You left me in despair.
Tom, screaming, woken up from a nightmare.
Tom's got bad eyesight.
The flash didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it done?
Everyone loves lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where are Tom's things?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom untied his eyes.
The tribe was not overjoyed to have a peacemaker.
Open up.
Put on your apron.
It's possible you're wrong.
I also baked cake.
Tom's got a plantation.
Why is Tom still at school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my advisors about which items to take.
I already wrote everything I needed to write.
Don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
There's nobody in the classroom now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's bike.
Is Dan aware of what he did?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom doesn't have any friends.
Who lives in this room?
I want you to come back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I never change my sleep schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen it?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something to Tom in her ear.
Tom can be very vindictive.
I've seen it happen.
We're gonna miss Tom so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom hasn't done anything like this before.
You're so bold.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Tatoeb really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you Google me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's back.
That's the way you need it.
I fell in love with you.
We're models.
What do you want?
Tom's got a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility for him is a burden.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I ate too much today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
Half an hour has passed.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was amazing.
I can't see a thing.
He's a very unpleasant man!
They crucified their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
You better be alone.
I need to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and hung the other one in that place.
Freeze!
Do you want some cheese?
I'll get her for you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are by no means bright.
That was very careless of Tom.
It's hollow.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got mad.
Let them cut your hair.
Anxiety is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay well.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom peered inside.
At the same time, you are hard and easy, and pleasant and bitter; I can neither live with nor without you.
Let's just say you're right for now.
Tom's doing great.
I don't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm in here.
That's what disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I understood.
Tom is spineless.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
We missed you.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
Everybody looks alike.
Don't forget it.
We have to find them first.
I'm in charge.
Tom hit Mary on the head with a pan.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better both get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very posh.
You need to help them.
Tom wasn't even crying.
You wrote a book, and it was great.
Tom turned the doorknob.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm seeing ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
Nothing is more pathetic than stupidity and indifference.
They're all making fun of each other.
Tom didn't protest.
What do websites come from?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're compassionate.
I hate eggplants.
I didn't say I did.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent the whole day cleaning up the snow.
His paralysis is getting worse, and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
Is Boston far?
They pay me to help you.
My jacket's too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could prepare it by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with it later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train going to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the cork out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that was attached to the chimney.
The doves symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I will do everything for the good of mankind.
Did you really stay home all night?
Anja's music is beautiful.
Is she a cabbie?
I must be losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
I'm falling asleep.
There is no scientific evidence that there is a link between character and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Avoid oversmoking.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn the radio on.
We're playing on a computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a man's product.
We've been looking all over for them.
I really like your website.
I'll get you.
Press this button.
Tom really can fight.
What's really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom broke up his car.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards carry eggs.
We'll do something.
I think Tom is cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is roasted in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I can see the way things are.
I make very stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Hold on a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where's Tom headed?
This is very similar to mine.
I was just eating, so I'm not hungry.
Please get out.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for any more money.
Tom likes adventures.
They don't have a shed.
Many trees have collapsed.
Lions don't know color.
That wasn't true.
The answer's fucked up.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're so far from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look this way.
I want my money back now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a really good time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the accident.
I can picture you married to Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote you a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed his wallet was missing.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
I've got shit coming out of my right ear.
The cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
These don't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
attaching the calendar to the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone ever loved you.
We packed their bags.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
They threw us a curse.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What's the text about?
Tom wrote Mary and thanked her for her help.
I've decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
The turtles live a long time.
Tom is a strong man.

Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I remember.
Did you bring a car here?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over.
I'm sure.
Will you wait a minute?
You're amongst friends.
You're weakening something.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start over.
It was a warm night.
Thanks for seeing me.
Susan's actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?

Why would I help him?
Tom flashed his shoes.

Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Watch me do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom gets it.
Well, just let me know.

I'm gay.
Let me see what I can do.

You can use my car.
Just relax.

Maybe Tom will apologize.
He's sucking up to the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come inside.
Is anybody sitting here?
I have to cut my spending this month.
No one's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you paid yet?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom wiped his face.
What good do I have of you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
It turns me on when he wears those clothes.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they're living upstairs under this one.
They believed.
I think they saw me.

I know what the problem is.
Tom listened to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I'm too late.
I could tell Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There are writing reports.
It hurts here.
You're upsetting Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just teasing you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep and finish it tomorrow.
You jumped a button.

We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is fleeting, but beautiful memories remain.

This is ginger ale.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18 years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom was wondering what Mary was going to say.
I don't like the sound of that.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not misunderstood.
Tom's safe.
I'll be waiting for Tom.
I assume you've read my report.
Tom's retired.
Don't do it again.

Make two lines.

He was sitting right in front of me.

What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.

Tom snuggled.
Do you understand the difference between what is right and what is wrong?
They're not stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
He's weak in sight.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.

Falcons have a sharp species.
I wrote them that.

Tom's blowing up a jive for nothing.
You deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not picking up figs.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working since nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know what you're saying?
It hurts so bad in here.
I hate this rug.
I'm a little sick.
Tom got cut off.
Tom couldn't remember where he left the umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.

That job's done.
It's unnatural.
What did you steal?

What the hell do you need, Tom?
He was gonna say something.
The heater's stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Drop your weapons on the ground.
How about we see each other tomorrow?
I'm the one you love.
We bought them those books.
That's quite possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It's like it's dirty.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.

I messed up.
It's healing me.
The answer is yes.
We knew you'd come.
I live in a city.
Let's go wake Tom up.
How do I find him?
The frost has melted.
I spilled blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm scared of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
It must have made it so much easier for you.
They never caught me.
I love my country.
I haven't learned to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't impress me.
Tom's comfortable.

Victory is bitter.
They're seen in the mirror.

Tom's been trying everything.
Do you have a cigarette?
The kids are sleeping upstairs.
I'm studying music.
I didn't go that bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of that.

Did you ask Tom why he was late?
It probably won't be worth waiting for.
I need to buy a new turn for the room.
Tell Tom to write to me.
Do you want to go to work?
I couldn't take it.
It's sunny today, but it's cold.
What exactly is this about?
I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom ran down.
Tom gave his word.
Tom and Mary have been gone since day one.
Let's hang out.
Girls run and play.
I'm not sure that's exactly what Tom did.
"Don't you eat the spinach?" "I'll eat it afterwards."
This is my favorite item.
Tom got his weight down.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are made of real leather and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom's singing.
Tom's not that tall.
She wears a leather belt to the profession.
They put out the fire.
She's finally gone.
Tom was crying out to Mary.
I'm gonna go look for them.

Why are you calling her?
You really need a shrink.
Tom gave a speech.
We're playing Sunday.
Tom's been surrounded.
You can only stay if you're quiet.
I want to know what happens next!

I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I told you everything?
Don't fight.
I expect your help.
Tom's going alone.

Tom's weird.
That was very nice.
My dad gives me a $10 allowance a week.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long did you work for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom knows French.
Tom's cutting me open.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you spill wine, it's appropriate to erase it with your elbow, right?
Men have about seven or eight times more testosterone than women.
What games do you want to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come and help us move the piano.
Tom used to be shy.
It's getting cold.
I couldn't sleep all night.
Trust me.
I'm looking for you.

I can go anywhere I want.
Tom was often bullied at school.
When does it start?
The bear bites itself.
Tom's passed the field.
I put three teaspoons of sugar in your tea.
I like her dark eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom calmed down.
The glove has a hole in its thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
That's what I suspected.
Tom doesn't do what he has to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is neither your friend nor your mind, it's just indifferent.
We did everything we could for her.
You should buy some sugar.
What did you have for dinner?
What did you do next?
Take care of Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the market.
When she started talking, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.

Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you cut the price a little bit?
First, I'm gonna take a swing.
Tom's 30 now.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
He became a Chunbab just a few days before he turned ninety-nine.
Did you ask everywhere?
It's important to keep in mind that no one is ever a hundred percent thing.
He gesticulates while he talks.
Sit next to me.
Tom is thrilled.

I was taking a nap.
What a collection!
Everyone has names.
Have you ever smoked a dick?
The dog was following me.
That was Tom's last words.
I think Tom's gone.
He's trying to become an actress.
My plastic bottle broke.
Is this our cabin?
Let's do this.
We're too sophisticated.
I threw my money in the water.
I think that's silly.
Tom is very careless.
The skyscraper is expected to sink into the swamp.
I can give her a message.
She's getting a little red.
Tom is a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom stood still and kept quiet.
I collect stamps.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
Do you live here?
The room looks like a cocoon.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom Fusher stuff.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I wouldn't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to go away and leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?

It doesn't matter.
I like comic books.

The wind continued to blow.
Meanwhile, the foolish uncle sat in the living room.

The leaves fall from the tree.
Do you have a band?
You're welcome to wait here.
I got a Friday in French.
I want the class quiet.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind is blowing.
It's a risky plan.
How soon did you get from here to the post office?
I don't want Tom involved in this.
It's no big deal.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you need to know this.
Are you going to dress up this year?
I'll do what you want.
I'm not that warm, either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there is an unforgivable act, it is an act to refuse to forgive.
The door creaked.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he was going?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I long for him.
He's lying at home.
I'm not even sure I remember.
Tom noticed Mary watching him.
You've got to be kidding me.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice guy.
The eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you rest?
You didn't ask why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let me talk to you.
I think Tom's nice.
The sky lightens up.
The noise will wake the baby.
Look straight ahead.
That's not exactly something a man should be getting ready for.
Tom and Mary are playing remi.
I've made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom leaned on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think I'd prefer my son.
How did you get here?
You picked up the book.
Don't get my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret journal.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked in two hours.
From him I found out about you.
I know you're upset right now.
He's on his way.
He's had an appetite since the long walk.
I have to go help her.
Tom used a cup of tea and a doughnut.
Tom could tell you.
I just can't get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do it, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both laughed again.
My wedding must be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like the way your hair looks.
Is he cold outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom's in danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
That's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is a fracture.
Tom is the tallest guy in the class.
Tom, you've grown up fast.
It was our only comfort.
No one would care.
Have you written in your journal today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can he do it alone?
Is this your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the lock, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that right now.
Why are you bending?
Come on, Tom.
I'm just gonna make sure I get there in time.
Nobody came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause disease.
We're almost ready.
Tom's got a sharp ear.
I bribed them.
I told you I couldn't.
Tom’s books have been translated into many languages.
I'm not comfortable with him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't take the wallpaper out.
I helped him open the table.
I had a potato steak last night.
It's better for your health to take the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is bad.
I'm sorry I even said something to them.
I wouldn't ask you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up at two and a half.
Tom's been drinking.
I slept in the coon.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That could work.
Aren't you cold on your short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
There's an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever been to.
I need an envelope.
Tom is rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any asal Japanese movies?
Did you get them?
French was first slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
Fingerprints on the knife determine her guilt.
Can I wait here?
We can look in the dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I baked you some cookies.
It can be done.
Italian cops drive me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I transferred it to Tom's schedule that you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a shame.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun to go to the party.
You didn't save the bell.
You put me on my head.
You have to be careful.
Tom's acting like he's stopped.
The entertainment you have continues your youth.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
What do you mean you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can make it here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
Meat smells bad.
Demeck, do I need to know you?
Tom skillfully covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I'm guessing nothing.
She's slow running.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in misery.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just broke Tom's room last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell this dog if it was higher.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets so much.
You need to hurry.
Everyone's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a bum.
We despise her.
He got here before them.
Here, brother, half.
Tom worked on the table with the new flies he just bought.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's high.
The landscape is excellent.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under your bed.
I can't go in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We'll have to hurry.
Tom was celebrating the win with wine.
We haven't got all week.
I'll try to contain myself.
Autumn's here.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you drive the car?
It only takes three minutes for the water to boil.
They could fire me for this.
What's the intention?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was great.
Dan was about Linda for a very short time.
I can't answer the question.
I want to take a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, gifted with reason and conscience and should treat one another in the spirit of universal humanness.
It was an accident.
This building has a lightning bolt.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do everything himself.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
Supra is too salty.
Why don't you go pick him up?
Tom, keep practicing.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean yes or no?
Tom was in the tunnel.
How could you want to be my friend?
Seems familiar.
I envy you.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Bosilyoc, jasphia, rosemary, timian, and oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're a insightful man.
Everything seemed fine.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared the room.
I knew you couldn't trust Tom.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
Well, I'm kind of flattered.
I'm practicing.
She may have lied to you, but I'm not here!
Let's just catch the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I'm sick.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled out a few coins.
The room was a buyer.
It's just a matter of solving this problem.
They must remove the bullet that was stuck to his spine.
It's so much fun.
Does Tom seem upset?
If you don't mind, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds.
One of the cases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your umbrella.
I don't have a sword.
Suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
I guess you don't know how it hurts to get stung.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did it.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to look into the dark.
Tom's busy with his research.
The wipers don't help against the ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
I don't think it comes down to asking Tom.
My brother will arrive tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are you caloric potatoes?
They'll get it soon enough.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary for the tail.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I'm worried about.
I'm gonna go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make him makeup.
I was waiting for her outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and grow up a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and phone number?
Tom used to shoot me with a rock.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry, Tom?
Tom will be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last ones.
They were standing in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I have a few reasons to remember.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They all got it all wrong.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I learned that there was a movie called "The Russians are coming!
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thanks.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Tom is still unable to write his name?
Tom put the diary in a drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many more days till Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I don't care about that.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She made tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
The mice are the carriers of the plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom's making a point.
I'm starting tomorrow.
I wasn't being honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
Tom's giving me the creeps.
I like roasted bones.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep while driving, causing traffic.
They hugged us.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was so beautiful.
Tom says hello to Mary with a wave.
That's okay.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How is this camera used?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't want to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French pretty well.
Make sure you don't overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't speak English, I don't speak German.
It'll take us about three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
I was disqualified.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's recovering.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You worry about him too much.
The president has announced that the United States will launch a satellite in orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweet.
Tom helped me out a little.
Am I too soon?
That sounds really strong.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this right?
Do you want to stop?
Watch it, Tom.
Tom tied his ropes.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America did not have the right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I need to talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom doesn't listen to us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Tom's off somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm's ringing.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
That's an unspoken fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom's getting a little grumpy.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom turned himself in to his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is like Bogotá, and Osaka is like Medellin.
Did you stop beating on your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I said I'll get it.
Survivors are the type of mammals.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I cook soup in a big pot.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the bull going?
You wiped your wet hair with a towel.
If an adult is lying to a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
It's possible I don't graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled a screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his hands.
Open the notebooks.
You can't let that settle.
Tom opened the cover.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom's moved on to the next question.
That was thoughtful.
I want a life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't like riddles.
This book will help you write skillfully.
This area is in the valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's no big deal.
I hope Tom finds happiness in his life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
Please, find the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd already seen Mary this morning.
I've been making my toasts with honey.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I assume the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom kicked his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
Nobody's thrilled.
I almost wouldn't have come.
I was making a cake.
Watch the count.
I'm impressed with your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom choked.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
I had a bladder infection last month.
Look at the girls.
I'll take off my weight.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate the foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What good does that do us?
I'm just with the one I want to be with.
You invited me to your wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Good, thank you!"
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick talk.
The lock's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were totally confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has a lot of good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom doesn't do sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt he needed to redeem himself.
This message is for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom picked up the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your shoulder.
The firm fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not hanging out.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is a serious matter.
Mars is the red planet.
You flagged the dog with a rock.
Tom kept staring.
It's already seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
He wrote his own book!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not get cocky.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary play with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need help from Tom.
They were satisfied.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you have to plow it.
Tom's not feeling well today.
We can't see.
Mahmoud can't stand to waste.
Nobody listens to you.
Okay, you convinced me.
Now I'm ready for him.
It's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgottenness and hate usually go together.
Tom didn't know it happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly you.
I agreed.
Tom admitted to spilling red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited the castles of Loara.
Tom is hopeless.
It's a little ahead.
I think about him every day.
I'll help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'd be happy to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as long as you like.
Just grab my cancer.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very pedant in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so much fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did this?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a while.
How many stomachs do I have to do on a daily basis?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned around to leave.
Tom's kind.
How was the party last night?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come over here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan's turned into a question mark.
You have very permeable eyes.
Isn't that understood?
We seemed tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want them all shot.
I think I write pretty well.
Are you going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Suck it up and go inside.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom looks rich.
Tom seems confident.
Would you like some water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the amount is not true.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to his party.
The squares have four angles.
I kept working.
They've developed an addiction.
Would you like me to come with you?
I'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat and kept quiet.
Get the shovel.
You have many different kinds of people here.
Mary threw herself at her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
Nobody listened to Tom.
Do you want me to get something from the supermarket?
Finish the mission.
Tom erased the knife blade from the jeans.
Tom was trying to stay focused.
Tom's got a long beard.
One of them came to me.
I can make that happen.
Are your palates bleeding?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put a pint of beer on his bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
We gave a seductive look.
Come on, don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I'd better come by later.
What do tigers eat?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Will you come down?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
He looked right through my glasses.
Linda convinced Dan that he was stalking her.
Why would they mind?
Let's not bother Tom.
The rope is durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do it.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave.
I need to set us free.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Did Tom get hurt?
Who could have broken the fish tank?
It came over my head.
Tell me what I'm doing here.
Tom has been struggling with depression for several periods of his life.
You want me to grab your bags?
I'd trust that with my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What's there to worry about?
I need a snack.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
Class is going wild.
There were penguin rates on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called the busman.
I want to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as you want.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move over.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk in four eyes.
Tom's not thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the results of the test?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was eating something.
She's an English student.
With such a vivid dream, he will become either a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her up.
Tom opened the bedroom windows.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna survive this.
We came to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spit on the chewing gum.
Make it my way.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to get bad habits!
She's been acting strangely.
Probably won't pay back.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda about her interest in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
You and I are strong, too.
The president looked strong.
What can I buy?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you played chess better than I did.
Is the bridge secure?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people get scared enough, anything can happen.
You're a tight town.
He ran as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is stiff.
Grab the day.
What's Tom ringing?
He's very handsome.
Make sure the buyer's careful.
Tom often runs away from class.
Now it's time to make up for it.
Most virgins have an entire hymen.
You can handle it.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I give food to the poor they call me a saint, when I ask why the poor don't have food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus was held back, we waited a long time in the rain.
You'll manage.
Does she have a dog?
We're resting.
Mary was wearing fake eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get into one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke French a lot better than he really did.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are soaked.
That medicine calmed the patient down.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look silly.
His mother's an American.
Relax.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The Sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
That means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fusher did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed pissed off.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's my call, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
He's doing a good job.
Tom got sick bad.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom's always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Should we wait here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got dumped.
I prefer goat cheese to a cow.
We get that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy in a while.
I can see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Is everybody having fun?
I've been watching all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
The carpenters cut wood.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Zini, come on.
Single - sex couples shouldn't be able to get married.
The cow forgot it was a calf once.
Give them this picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Sewing is handmade.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm very confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister rip the letter off.
Let me try that.
Could you turn off the cigarette?
What were they laughing at?
Why would I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cabbie.
Still no sign of Tom.
I was home then.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The gator ate the dog.
Lies give birth to other ships.
I don't have any more money.
The chair is plastic.
Sunlight is supposed to be the best disinfectant.
You'll get a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always heartless.
Get yourself killed.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very helpful.
He put me up.
Did you call 911 yet?
You brought us lunch, our plan is to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
Red light's on.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow fell today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much did you bet?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're doing here.
Blood's moving through the body.
I'll make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
They won't help the lies.
My thumb hurts on my right leg.
The apple is healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them gifts.
What would the prince want?
Where are we coming from?
I really don't know.
Do you have a stopwatch?
Tom's a caregiver.
Dan had no compassion for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
Their houses were built of stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this right now.
The meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't speak English. I don't speak Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom didn't really think about that kind of thing.
There's wind.
I'm just messing with you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
I bought her a wristwatch.
Just sit there.
Tom can barely walk.
So didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I'm expecting visitors.
They saved the whole crew.
At what age did you start menstruating?
You're teasing me.
But not in front of the choir.
The firm went bankrupt.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not much of a talker.
You guys were right.
It happens.
There were no others injured.
I decided to take the train.
I'm sure you'll manage.
Are you going to eat at home or out?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'll get sick.
Are you making fun of me?
I think I know him.
I drink milk.
Don't piss Tom off.
It's a difficult task.
You need to make him listen.
I was surprised that it was so easy.
If only he'd been here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom calls Mary a lot.
Thank you, darling.
They have increased the territory of the kingdom.
I didn't come here to hurt people.
Tom must have known about it by now.
She's my mother's aunt.
I've been looking everywhere for them.
Tom is incapacitated.
My school has a band.
Tom can't deny it.
It went red.
I have to go.
Who sleeps with dogs wakes up with fleas.
His aunt is all alone in London.
It's not a big miracle.
I feel sick.
This neighborhood is very lonely.
Maybe he'll turn up tonight.
I fixed his radio.
This is a leather belt.
Tom hooked up with a cold.
When did I ever try to give you money?
How's your mom?
It doesn't matter.
Listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him for you.
Don't tell my mom.
You can avoid such problems if you have such counsel in mind.
His excuse is far from perfect.
I hope we beat Tom.
Put your things away.
Where did you put it?
Tom can't accept defeat.
Tom's my husband.
What do I get out of it?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't very busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for a man.
You shouldn't be here for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin that.
You're very passionate.
My headache's gone.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars, and Jupiter are planets.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a handkerchief.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that pretty?
Hey, don't be a pain in the ass.
Isn't that unusual?
I fell out of a wall.
The clock's broken.
Tom must be stopped.
Isn't that excessive?
They know what happened.
Tom unwrapped the scarf from his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower was in the middle of ruins.
Tom's a big materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Just relax a little bit.

I thought you might be interested in finding out.
Hand me the pliers.
The Hague loves cold weather.
This is a little loose with the profession.
Tom never lived in Boston.
Have you forgiven me yet?
Did Tom know?
Would Tom lie to you?
I'm not even tired.
She's afraid of losing money.
Tom swallowed the buffalo.
Canada produces good wheat.
He loves his dad very much.
Let's go upstairs.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom did well today.
Milton hasn't slept well in a week.
When's the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he was planning on staying with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's no secret Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you preparing?
Now this is your house.
Why don't you try some sushi?
How you doing?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life doing what I wanted.
It's not my call.
Despite our expectations, no charges have been made.
The lust is one of the seven deadly sins.
Tom is irresponsible.
I've always wanted to be a teacher.
Tom saw Mary getting ready to say something.
I won't be in town next week.
They sowed seed, they grew it, and they married it; and the river that was heated was running water.
He feels hatred for his dad.
Tom helped us escape.
Tom had an accident.
Tom drove Mary home.
I ski a lot.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I have to be free.
I'm as qualified as Tom.
When is my turn coming?
Tom didn't make it.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a printed error.
It's not often someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
Will the police come?
First we have to find him.
Dan made his assistants laugh with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I could barely save myself from getting caught.
I can't get involved.
You beat them.
They shut up.
Tom's back soon.
I'd be in.
History is written by the winners.
Tom was the only one on board when it exploded.
Who's gonna make up for the cyanide?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
Nothing bothers me here.
You tricked me.
It's for sin.
Nothing is sacred.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
No one really knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're picking her up.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted like that.
I was three blocks away.
I'm here to talk about her.
We have fish for dinner today.
I don't eat at restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost there.
You seem to have an infection.
I can't think of anything smarter.
The sky is red in the twilight.
I came to wish you good luck.
It would be a pleasure for you to come.
They must be happy.
We need to fix this.
I don't speak English very well.
We'll deal with it.
The bread is made from flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan, you got that right.
Would you like a cookie?
Who brought this?
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
Dan may have had a fight with Linda.
There was silence in the room.
Everybody loves him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a tough test.
It's warm here in hell.
I've overlooked that.
This is your doing!
Please come back to me.
Stay here.
Congratulations on your wedding.
Kids, you're here to stay.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Is he barking at your dog?
Wonderful!
The palace has a high tower.
The kids have homework.
Let's go pick them up.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
You have to ask them first.
I made a phone call.
Tom's gone sideways.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did it.

I hate that horn.
The doctor gave her a sedative.
Does Tom look like a man who's afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you the way you are.
It's funny.
It relaxes a lot.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was compromised.
I wish I hadn't done that.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why doesn't anyone want to help us?
The hole's narrow.
You need to go help him.
Are you enjoying that?
I had a great time tonight.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom made a sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
It's nice of him to bring gifts like this.
I embarrassed him.
Shut up or you'll get kicked out.
Get out of the way.
Let's get started!
How long does it take?
I'm good, thanks!
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.
It's getting dark.
Tom's been brought up.
I'm surprised Tom left with Mary.
He's been blind since birth.
The book contains fifteen life stories.
Tom worked all night.

Tom's buried in Boston.
Tom's not my cousin.
What's Tom talking about now?
How are you two doing?
Did you die of an overdose with sleeping pills?
His opinions are worthless.
Sign downstairs, please.
Tell me where to find her.
It was really good.
Did you know Tom lived in Boston?
Tom, I only put on one shoe.
You don't want to do something that reminds them that you're not actually big enough to be here.
I won the lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a butcher.
I have faith in myself.
Tom's here, isn't he?
Oh, my God, it's raining.
Shoo, dog!
They jumped in the water.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom speaks French better than you think.

Isn't that the guy who wants to buy you the house?
I know Tom's in Boston right now.
That's her.
I can give you a ride.
Is Tom safe?
However, there is a solution.
You're not organized.
I'm trying.
I'm sure Tom can handle it this way.
I don't think I've ever been this scared before.
Can you do the job?
We have to go back for him.
You're rude.
Are you sports?
It just sounds boring.
Bring him in.

A thousand years make up a thousand years.
I'll put it on your account.
I plan to visit Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
That's an honest word.
We have three guards working alternately.
We can't stay together.
Visitors are welcome.
Can you represent in a few words?
Tom was there.
I want you to call them.
Bring your toolbox.
Does Tom contribute?
This is a little embarrassing.
We were both busy.
I'm three hours apart.
I like crossword puzzles.
I expected them to be here.
Tom was taking pictures of this.
Tom shut his mouth.
So don't you hate him?
Stop acting like a child.
Tom's not hot.
He never hired them.
I like cake.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom's a dentist in retirement.
That was very nice.
I'm going to hide.

Tom told me he was planning on going to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a whole different story.
Who's your best friend?
Next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm going to end it.
I'm going to change.
He hung up on me.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom that I want him to pay me back today.
You'd make a great mother.
Tom keeps working.
Please find me a chapter.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom disagrees.
They rejected our first suggestion.
Sooner or later, my movie's gonna break.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, but never could have happened here.

Well, he's not in a hurry.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
It rained two days ago.
It's not a shameful job.
If you bite me, I'll bite you too.
You really should have let me call a cab.
I baked apple pie.
The cannon from the hooves of the horse calmed him down.
Your hands are soft.

Tom's connected to Mary.
Are you cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna need to get Tom permission.
His joke made us all laugh.
The main question is, what do we do about it?
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
This is pointless.
They ate it.
How many cups of coffee a day are too many?
Tom hates running.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I clapped my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You'd have done the same thing in my place.
Now, let's continue this conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I smiled.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Are you going?
I'm happy these days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop fooling around.
Try to understand this.
What kind of a man are you?
I should try to help them.
Can I collect a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom makes three times as much money as I do.
I spit one out.

We're wasting time.
Tom said he and Mary couldn't come to the party.
Just try to find him.

I think Tom is petty.
Is the difference visible?
Come see us tomorrow.
Tom visited Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.

The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom sleeps tight.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
Tom has an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hate.
You have a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thank you for coming.
I'm as tall as he is.
Tom couldn't have done it without Mary's help.
So that's where Tom is?
The day before last, she spent the night drinking at a meat inn.
I'm in.
Do you need a date?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I believed him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to repay you.
They're coming again.
You're really sweet.
I bet Tom paid a lot of money for his new car.
This is a completely different joke.
I wouldn't trust Mary at all.

I'd be happier if you three went back outside.
What's stopping you?
Tom has thin lips.
Kids blow bubbles.
Tom exercises the violin at least half an hour every day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?

I wish Tom had more time for me.
I long for him.

Tom's room is rshum.
At your service.

Tom seemed a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to my place.
Tom and Mary seem perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more stuff I got, the more I'm gonna have to clean up.
I've found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don't forget to butter yourself with sunscreen.
Was it hard for you?
Tom's voice was barely hearing himself.
Don't knock.
I've decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When will that happen?
We're gonna have to reschedule.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just sleep it off.
Tom's good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was a mess.
Music is just love in search of words.
Sitting around all day is unhealthy.
Tom will be waiting.
I'll starve you to bend over.
The real story is a little different from what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon was coming down slowly.
Who wants insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you're here?
You're not having second thoughts, are you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she immediately knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures don't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; in any case, you have to.
I did it.
Are you ten?
We still need a plan.

I'm gonna go ask them.
Tom is nothing like his brother.
Tom was stubborn.
That was brilliant.
Please tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you thrilled?
Tom could never have done it alone.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Allow me to introduce Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the pie into eight pieces.
You may be needed.

Doesn't look much different.
You've been studying.
Tom and made room for Mary on the bench.
We're kicking his ass.
It's okay.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know whether to be happy or not.
Did you put her in?

Your excuse is pretty much accurate.

Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm done.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun shines at night.
No one gets fired.
There's no one else.
When I was traveling to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
You pulled the rope.
I can't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom caught the fog.
They tied my eyes.
Do we really want to help them?
The one paying the bills has the right to be masters.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, bring me the porridge.
When will you visit us?
Tragedy happens every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm good at hearing.
Give me those sheets.
You can have mine.
Tom's not gonna like that.
All comments are unnecessary.
Did you do this for me?
Can you get them some help?
Tom made his mouth cry.
That smells like cheese.
Tom's not mistaken.
The patient suffers from hallucinations.
Why is it so important that we be there today?
Problem without gold is better than gold without honor.
I didn't want milk.
Tom seems offended.
We know him.
I spent hours napping there.
Tom was holding a drink in his hand.
What a couple they are!
Did Tom get up early this morning?
Your complaints have upset me.
I'm naked.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.
Do you think Tom wants his job?
It's noisy in here.
What can be done?
I guess you found him.
Don't take it too literally.
Tom is very talkative.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom's crazy.

Are you saying you don't want Tom to come to your party?
I'll let you know what's going on.
Whose house is this?
Tom would have failed without Mary's help.

How do I find Tom?
I didn't hurt them at all.
The baby's grabbing the rattle.
Now I'm gonna go look for Tom.
I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This will do the job for now.
They need to talk.
That's not exactly what happened.

Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Tell me if you get a boyfriend.
It was amazing.

I can barely see him.
I'm coming.
I was half asleep.
Do not expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the nice things and the books.
This is much worse.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna get lost.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
It stings me.
Don't you ever suspect anything?

Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.

I want to know why you're gonna be late.

Let's go to lunch.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It must have come from somewhere.
The weekend party was fully equipped with pool, barbecue, football field and a pool table.
Tom claims he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young back then.
I hear you've been asking questions about me.
While he was eating pizza, he was boring his sister.
We should've given up sooner.
That's close enough.
Tom's being polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been wasted.
"Why do you do that?" "I can do that."
What a pig you are.
Lock the gate.
Tom let the heat go.
We're all the same.
I want to be there for you.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that horrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
This sounds totally acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar contradictions: one was sincere and confidential and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I will not give in.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I'm not going to quit.
She shut down the computer.
She bought it at the butcher shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There's only two species in Irish.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So, what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed talking on the phone.
These are amazing.
Tom's got his hands full.
Tom was thrilled.
I eat pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I need to take them over at some point.
The noise has clouded the whole city.
The one who loves flowers can't be a bad person.
This is not a joke.
They flashed.
You're mean.
Did you give Tom's note?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have small breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom was pushing it.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She's always wearing her clothes.
Tom was the boss.
That's ugly.
There can be discussions about that.
Women don't like you.
It's time to get up.
This isn't your problem. This is mine.
Before I went to bed, I drank three cold pills.
It's possible Tom's wrong.
They may need help.
I don't have vodka.
Tom's acting like a spoiled brat.
It's too bad you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me about?
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is forever.
First of all, you have no right to draw conclusions, second of all, your argument was based on a false assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems bored.
I grow cattle.
She borrowed the liner.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to lend me her keys.
Tom has a mustache.
There was a war going on.
Was Tom in on it?
The thief turned into a cop.
We'll let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're mean and repulsive.
I wish I could have helped you more.
Tom can't be seen anymore.
I think we're done here.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the front of the building, and when I walked past her in a car, I didn't recognize her.
Is it possible that this is all there is?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has got to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the kids were sitting in a circle on the floor.
Tom, forget it.
Invite him to join us.
It will not be easy to do so without much help.
Tom knows Boston well.
We won this time.
Tom works at a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They gave him a sedative.
This isn't about the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we're not careful, that's what's gonna happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need a little help.
I thought Tom came from Boston.
This is a very difficult test.
I'm getting a divorce.
That dinner.
My jar is leaking.
You're gonna get wrinkled.
Tom's a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geyser releases hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting we give Tom all the money, are you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home to go back to.
I'm here on my own.
It's to protect you.
Someone's always been there for me.
They don't want that.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He says he wants to see you.
You were right, Tom.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you connect with him?
Tom said if he won the lottery, he'd buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be kind to the elderly.
Precious stones include aquamarine, amethyst, emerald, quartz, and ruby.
Go find them.
You have to ask your mother's permission before.
I'm gonna take Tom's place.
What did you think of coming to Boston?
You're our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You've been searching for the hens.
It's been a beautiful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I had a quick lunch.
Tom remembered all sorts of things that no one else could remember.
You can easily tell them apart.
I'm gonna go look for her.
Of all the languages I had learned, French was the easiest.
Tom wrote his homework.
I count to 200.
Watch this.
Shall I go?
A boy looks like a monkey.
The butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you do?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did he want?
We have a fried goose with potatoes.

You and I are flying the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom's not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does the hour begin?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at the auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
An hour before the event.
You were amazing.
I'm not giving up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm's ringing.
The bird raised the twig with its beak and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to leave.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same man three years ago.
Everyone smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is unusually calm.
I'll ask Tom to spare time for you in the morning.
What the hell did you get?
Tom was struggling to get rid of himself.
What am I gonna be to them?
Tom didn't tell Mary anything.
It's not the right time.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
Tom ran past Mary.
I got scratched by a cat.
Tom's not an old man.
The question is how did Tom do it?
I swear it was them.
Did he have a bathing suit?
His nose is the best.
I can't ask them now.
Tom has brown hair.
Long live the Soviet Union!
It's really cool.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's a simple question.
The bush is on fire.
Tom was hurt.
My conscience is biting me.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Toads are amazing creatures.
He has three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom is drunk with tequila.
In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You've had enough of this.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's doing something.
You should have asked her first.
Tom's got a scar on his cheek.
Don't you trust us?
I pay my respects.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Did you have a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to create a habit of brushing your teeth for every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom collected the heart.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed out.
This is the king's most reliable advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom is very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can imagine.
No one gets hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
Tom must have added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed things.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom keeps climbing.
Tom might be able to set your car on fire.
Did you hear that?
What did they find?
You lied to my face.
I'm gonna go find her.
I wanted to trade.
They're listening.
I didn't realize Tom did it.
If I ignore him, he'll leave.
They'd only bother Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I learned it by heart.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach, so they spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on edge.
He's a little deaf, so speak up.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's up to you.
That's a very dry-cleaning explanation.
The walk before breakfast is refreshing.
Since the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them in place after their choice.
Wasn't it awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
He was framed for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We're all eager to see the movie.
It's very simple.
I'm coming to get her.
Tom was wearing a one-pack shirt.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
Dinner was so good!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, and division isn't.
I'm having a hard time.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what it says in today's paper?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks from three to six cafes a day.
Tom croaked loudly.
It was Bether.
Tom started snoring.
I'm gonna ask you to stay for a while.
We're watching two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everybody pointed at her.
Maybe Tom will be dead by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was freaking out.
This tin is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to hear about Tom for the first time?
Tom relaxed his hand.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
The steam clouded my glasses.
So, no, no, no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We were all rooting for her.
Didn't you see the Al's flag?
Cheer up!
I told you it'd be hard to pull it off.
I think I found one of those.
You'll try, won't you?
Tom's been out of food all week.
I don't quite understand you.
Even though I'm a godly man, I'm still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Are there any problems I should know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't be so mad.
A lot of people are hunting.
He deserves the reward.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
We need to investigate something.
Tom, open your eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are your breasts?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary shut him up.
We met in the mess hall.
How was Tom?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The medicine has to be taken on an empty stomach.
Tom's not involved.
Guess it's our job not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
I got it all wrong.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I baked you a loaf of bread.
Porks of marzipan don't rumble.
Tom regains consciousness.
Tom got Mary angry.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom's good for it.
Tom might be here today.
Tom doesn't distinguish between reality and fantasy.
Tom's a hero.
Tom doesn't have the will.
Will you help?
Don't you pass out on me.
Tom wasn't home when I stopped by.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Let's do it one more time.
You'd rather die on your feet than live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We got out of there at 11 o'clock.
You can ask me anything you want.
He used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of family are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
You only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it's of another dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they've made up a cure for it yet.
Every member must attend.
She didn't get the joke.
This is the ugliest snowman I've ever seen.
He's hoping to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Do you understand his name?
Looks like it's not helping.
You have to let me take a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
The flour is made of wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreed with Mary on the subject.
You're right.
I'll go.
It's my 16th birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go see Tom.
Did Tom buy you any presents?
You two are so cute together.
You're beautiful.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
What's luck?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
You ripped your key bone while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
Show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blinder.
Do you really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was cocky.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
You asked me if I wanted something to cook.
Watch the road.
We'll stop by the road.
I heard Tom go up the hill.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't be nervous about that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
It's time to close up.
Leave him to me.
The stone rolled down the hill.
She went to the hairdresser.
Tom's totally crazy.
Let's do it again!
It doesn't make his heart go away.
You don't need to comment.
Chicken's raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
That time, Tom was swimming.
Penguin's very sweet.
You're such a nerd.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was okay here.
They look terrified.
I could make it easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I'd never leave home with my slippers.
I think Tom's a stickler.
She had a terrible infection and her ovary started.
I don't need counseling.
This doesn't work.
It doesn't come under consideration.
Tom's heading for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He used to act weird.
We would have hung them.
Now's probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a moment.
I have a list of her.
That was so stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things I should be doing.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we just take it all?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake the cake from the gates?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the most intelligent.
I had to protect Tom.
This is so relaxing.
Call him right away.
Stick to the subject.
She really wants to talk.
I have questions in tons.
This is an interesting, funny, and even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language looks at the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put your pajamas on.
This way.
This is sacred land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
It's my birthday in July.
We've got everything.
How much is one beer?
Tom said he can't play tennis.
Where did you find her, live all?
This was at the top of the pile.
I'm done with that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godfather.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we got in a fight.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you'd found another one.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's hot enough for demecquares?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Do you have a crush on him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling.
I lost track of time.
This island is American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people does he have in this room?
I've already thought about it.
I would do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You cut your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little involved.
