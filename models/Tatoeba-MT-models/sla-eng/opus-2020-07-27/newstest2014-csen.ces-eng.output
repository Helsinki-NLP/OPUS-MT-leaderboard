The black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying hard to find money for repairs that are breaking down the highway network, many are beginning to see solutions in a small black box that easily fits into your car's dashboard.
Devices that monitor every mile that the motorist drives and transmit this information to the authorities are the core of the controversial efforts of Washington and the state planning authorities to renovate an outdated system of financing American main roads.
Usually, bad highway design suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of a wide variety of communities.
The Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbyed for the government to use these small boxes that would record the miles and perhaps even where you are going – and then use this information to construct the tax scale.
Thea party is terrified.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress cannot agree to continue, some states are waiting for nothing.
They find out how they can move over the next decade to a system in which the driver is paying for the km of the road he is driving.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black lockers, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"It is not a matter of how much we can choose," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Association of State Administration in Southern California, who plans to start tracking captured kilometres by every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology is used to do that.
Let's raise them to the fact that the Road Trust Fund, funded by taxes that Americans pay at pumping stations, is at the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars will travel many more kilometers to one gallon.
Federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased over the past 20 years.
Because of the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise tax by just one cent.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert in transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 vehicles to test this system of payment for an occupied mile.
"In the long term, this seems to be the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of kilometres taken.
It is no surprise that this idea is enjoyed by urban liberals, since taxes can be used to change the behaviour patterns of drivers, which, for example, can help limit traffic congestion and greenhouse gas formation.
Californian designers look to this system when planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (Representative of Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Transport Committee, said he also saw this as the most functional long-term alternative.
Reason Foundation free market representatives are also favored by the idea that drivers will pay for the miles they have been taken.
"It is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president for the strategy of the Reasonan organization.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former American transport ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to pay for a kilometer.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project involving about 10,000 cars.
However, the management of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing the constituents of the population, whose daily life often means to damage many kilometres of work outside the city.
However, a number of countries and cities are moving forward on their own.
The hottest part is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the state taxes for miles, instead of gas taxes.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is looking into the project right now.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent in freight wagons.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 state ministries of transport, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept is not limited to advocates.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were equipped with equipment recently, drivers were concerned that the government was able to monitor every move they made.
"Trainings related to watching Big Brother and similar issues were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who manages the strategy and operation at the Nead ministry of transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance facilities. ”
There is no need to build a huge heavy-duty technology infrastructure that inevitably expands to record day-to-day visits and individual arrivals.
The problem is among the few states that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many kilometres the vehicle will travel, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do it, said Khan, the public will be calmer.
The hunt for such technology has led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (the real crazy distance).
This company was initially not involved in the government's tax relief action.
She wanted to break into the emerging legal liability insurance market where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they would go.
But this device, which is testing, attracts the attention of road network designers, because it does not use GPS and only supplies limited amounts of information that are regularly recorded using modem.
“People will be more willing to do this if you do not follow their speed and position,” says Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
There have been a number of major errors in some of these pilot programmes.
They're much cheaper and less touchy ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can pick a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not have to take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average number of kilometres taken by all the population of the state.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will come to this concept if the device can do more, not less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped so that additional charges can be paid at parking hours to provide insurance according to captured kilometres and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so motorists can avoid traffic congestion.
"Motorists will be willing to participate because of the value of the benefits offered to them," the city's projection document states.
Some transport designers, however, would like to know if all the discussions about paying per kilometre are not just a huge problem.
Officials from the Metropolitan Transport Committee in the San Francisco Strait area say that Congress could easily resolve the problem with the bankrupt Road Trust Fund by increasing gas taxes.
One-time or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid or other vehicles that do not consume much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for radical operations when it is enough to marry aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Sobotka negotiates for ČSSD.
Social democracy is talking to tramps, people and baboons, and they are preparing a common procedure.
If the social democrats get tired of it within a few weeks, they will sit at the negotiating table with perfectly assembled partners who will put a complete list of demands on the table, including ministerial posts.
The ČSSD envoys will then swallow sour coalition grapes, or nods, to the vivacious minority government.
Boguslav Sobotka came across for the first time after four days of being in a wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political game and, above all, force convicted liars to resign.
The confirmed negotiator for the party is only him so far, the other members of the team will be allowed only after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CSC).
I apologized to the game members and now to the citizens.
He's not supposed to lie in his personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Hasek, after the worst management of social democracy.
He added that he doesn't stick to being the First Vice President.
"I will tell my decision on 10 November at the CV," said Hashek.
Similarly, Czech Vice-President Zdeněk Škromach and Head of the Parliamentary Club Jerome Tejc spoke.
However, he warned that he had been elected only two days ago.
The two Members then announced that they would do everything to make the 50-member ČSSD sound one vote.
He put the crown of Michal Hashek on the absurd theatre, saying, "I am a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and respected the decisions of the party authorities."
So another lie in direct transmission.
Or did he forget in his call to Sobotk's resignation and his dismissal from the negotiating team that August's UVV had risen 57 percent to the fact that Boguslav Sobotka is the party's candidate for prime minister?
However, the chief of ČSSD made a powerful army of enemies by calling on the VVV until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media with a variety of gossip and gossip, possibly recalling the real mistakes of Sobotk's political career.
There will be strong laundry washing, signs of a dark alliance between the globaron Zdenek Bakala and the Sobotk wing.
The friendly relationship of Bohuslav Sobotka and influential lawyer Radek Pokorný will be discussed.
Disputes erupt in the South Moravian or Moravian Silesian organization ČSSD.
The words of the island's prime minister and of Sobotk's ally Peter Cainar: "Chartu 77 I signed so that the country is not ruled by idiots."
If the UV had already met this weekend, the liars would probably have been forced to sacrifice their functions.
Traitors will burn their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently winning chief of ČSSD will then end with the nickname Boguslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor on problems with OH in Soča: Communication with the Russians is demanding
The corners of his mouth will indicate a faint smile and then only a deep breath: "It is difficult."
Cooperation with the 2014 Olympics team is a little more complicated, according to Martin Doctor.
We can forget about what was at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic Mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower than that.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of the invoices, they are relatively fast, not so much in terms of providing information on essential things.
For three months now, perhaps we have been paying money to provide us with an official identification of individual villages so that we can do a number of things.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating this thing.
They keep communicating in a number of ways.
Has the Olympic village been delivered yet?
But it's not a catastrophic state anymore.
We walked in empty rooms a month ago.
Lucky houses are worth it.
What does that mean, they're empty?
Are there any finished floors?
Just basic concrete, that's how it was a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even though there's a danger that when we get there on January 26th as a front, it'll still feel glue.
And if they don't, what's it gonna be?
Mr. Putin, would you say that's where the army is?
That's what's gonna happen.
Just so it's not that olympic village = the viceroy's village.
It's more of a threat that they won't be able to make the journeys, for example, they won't make the details.
Maybe they'll have roads in such a state that we'll have to take sticks from the London Games with us.
But I believe they'll put it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now it's roughly 78, although depending on the nomination criteria, the number changes.
Maybe the cruisers are going to go to the three of them that left.
There is also no doubt about the speedboat Martin Sáblíková, but it is different in development.
Are you still on the road to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should fly there until January 26th.
What houses are gonna look like in the Olympic village, we know.
We even measured some things by metro so that we wouldn't just believe the blueprints.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what does the Head of Mission do a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for an annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am making a common agenda in terms of communication with the organisation committee in Sočo.
Putin promised the ecological Olympics, plan to catch him a giant secret dump.
Winter sports fans are already cutting meters until the opening of the Soča Olympic Games, others are increasingly worried about their preparation.
The Russian Olympics, even though they start in February, they face another scandal.
It seems impossible for the Russians to live up to the promise that the preparation and performance of the games will not in any way disrupt the nature of the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will go in four months.
After all, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a very high-ranking Russian label, and the Canadian games were recorded in the history of the Olympics as being more neutral to the environment.
However, it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to organise games with "zero waste" has long since been committed.
Reporters at AP last week discovered a giant building site in the village of Achštyr near Sochi.
So a dump full of building materials, tyres, canisters and insulating foams were found in August by environmentalists, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities have cleared and the dump has disappeared.
Just for a while.
Last week, reporters were given a view of the landfill of the size of three football courses.
It is not the only one, in the area of such places there were several, the British newspaper The Times described.
Russian Railways, a state monopoly that builds about 60 kilometers between Soča airport and sports resort, work on the site.
One of Putin’s close associates, Vladimir Jakunin, was led by a businessman who had already spent 280 billion rubles.
In August, railways defended that the dump was founded by one of the subcontractors.
The locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achstyr, all of them have been driving trucks full of waste materials for three months and nights.
According to experts, waste contaminates the local river Mzymtu, other streams, and eventually the Black Sea.
"The water has contaminated the juicy water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," the British newspaper Vladimir Kimaev of the environmental nonprofit organisation EWNC said.
Illegal dumps are not the only problem with the Russian organisational committee and government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
To compare: Sochi games will cost $51 billion, while the summer Olympics in Beijing 2008 amounted to $43 billion.
Last year's games in London cost only 19 billion and the mentioned Vancouver 9 billion.
In addition to the corruption scandals, the project detentions and the concern that there will be enough snow, there have also been reports that human rights are not respected when working on sports and infrastructure exhibitions.
Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth to protest not getting paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers are in line with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors are about to support the Russian gays at the Olympics.
Young couple matured to live with their parents, new house offers privacy to both generations
Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given the task of proposing a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, while the property itself is somewhat thought out.
The requirement further stated that there would be two generations in the house who would want to live together, but each one should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a mildly weighing plot.
The architects therefore decided to place every household in one of the floors of the house.
"In the design of the proposal, we respected the family ties, history and memories associated with the place."
"The three different functions of the house are connected several ways through the exterior of the object, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their privacy," the designers explain.
The household of parents is at the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family tradition and memories apply.
The individual parts of the house are easily identifiable from the outside, because they differ in the various final arrangement of facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was formed by panels of boards, the part where the office is, is rejected white and the remaining elements remained in pure concrete execution without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glassy, making the interior of the house very connected with the exterior.
The household of the parents, the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
Connection of the interior with the exterior breaks the side wall, which starts in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in a young couple's home.
The young couple enter the house by the main entrance to the hall and then climb the stairs into their spaces.
The stairs are the main dominant of the interior of the house.
Their constructions allow a lot of natural light to fall through them.
That's how the architects tried to separate the house from the others and press him with something unique.
The household of the young couple is treated as one open space with kitchen area, dining room and living room together.
Only the glass wall with sliding doors divides it from the terrace.
Living area with dining and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed of one large open space, which freely passes onto the terrace, from which is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the highest floor is captured in a pure combination of white and black paint.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enter the house in the main entrance, find themselves in the entrance hall, and then climb up the stairs.
Defend academic freedom, it pays for Zeman and ODS.
Repeatedly, in recent months, I have called for open letters from students, teachers and the management of high and high schools in several regions to defend academic freedom from the election campaign conducted at schools by President Miloš Zeman.
I've met with more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused a lecture by the Honorary President of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the electoral period, even received an appeal in the form of a non-invitation to celebrate the Czech Republic's national holiday.
Here is a list of school representatives who were no longer so brave and visited Miloš Zemana: Technical high school in Brno, High school of Hladnov in Ostrava, High School of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Cologne, University of J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now in Pardubice to see the continuation of policy enforcement in higher schools.
The newly elected ODS Member, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic function and seems normal to him.
Professor, it's really not the same as staying in the mayor of a small town, for example.
Would you like to be among the CzechsSD hats who are seeking the function of a Member and a Haytman at the same time as they are to degrade both professions?
Because you tell people they can handle both these demanding functions with their left rear.
I know, there's an example of Michal Haska, who can handle even a few dozen functions at once.
But that's probably not exactly the kind of person you should be following.
We will also find the opposite and positive example MUDr. Štěpánka, who prefers to leave the parliamentary post to be fully dedicated to the leadership of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the dean's office is that, in the course of your functions, you will violate the political and academic soil of Pardubice University.
The management of Pardubic ODS sees your current impact on both posts as an advantage for the University.
But you will be able to help your school without becoming a dean.
I think that a similar view as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig will have your students.
Therefore, consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that voters will count on you in the next election.
And it doesn't have to take long.
In Kunovice, they don't add cabbage bubbles, they don't add chemistry to it
More than a thousand tons of sour cabbages want to be produced in Slovakia's Fruit Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé in the coming months.
The season started here in October and will take about six months.
Since 1925, he has been producing healthy delicacies in a traditional way, that is, walking directly in large dances.
In modern industrial times, it's about rarity.
Our employees have found an almost ten-mile-long route in exchange.
Each of the ten tanks consists of 15 to 30 tonnes of cabbage, filling one takes three shifts," said the director of the Slovenian Fruta David Kladroba.
The cabbage heads drive directly from their fields farmers mostly from Ostrovska and Břeclavska.
The employees of the Fruity then cleanse the vegetables, remove the bones and throw them into the ring.
From here, already chopped cabbage falls into pools with a six - foot [6 cm] depth, where hookers dressed in white clothes and shavings work tirelessly.
That's how they squeeze out unwanted air.
The last folded layer of cabbage is covered with sail and weighed with water.
"The green croissant then beams six to eight weeks for spontaneous milky acidification without any addition of acidifying substances," said Director Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to domestic production, individual layers of workers spill salt and cumin.
The cabbage is on its way to the filling line after the fertilization.
It is packed in a sugary effusion into sachets or jars and subjected to sterilisation.
Hamé supplies sour cabbages mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.
It also registers interest in some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to ‘co-operate’ with Germany in connection with US monitoring
Edward Snowden, an American intelligence snitch, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German Parliament if US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German Member Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum and discussed the possibility of testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, who handed the media over to Berlin on Friday, states: “Even though the result of my efforts has been evidently positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as fugitives and is attempting to criminalize political demonstrations with heavy lawsuits that do not give room for defence.”
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German interior minister, said to Zeit Online magazine: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible.”
The tension between the US and Germany began to rise when a statement appeared that NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who runs the parliamentary panel that oversees the reporting, said that if there was any chance of questioning Mr. Snowden as a witness “without putting himself at risk and completely destroying relations with the US”, this should be done.
Mr Sträbel, Member of Parliament for the German side of the Greens, posted on his Twitter post a photo of Mr Snowden.
On his way to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Sträbele said that according to a former NSA contractor, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurance that he would be “safely safe there,” said a member of Parliament.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he was facing a violent and persistent campaign associated with the persecution that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that the world’s reaction to his “act of political expression” gave him courage.
Citizens in all and high-level officials — including those in the United States — have assessed the discovery of an irrefutable system of widespread monitoring for public service.
The letter includes the offer to cooperate with the German authorities "as long as the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
Killing us is sorry, but we're innocent, defending the Red Khmers.
Nuon Chea was number two in the hierarchy of Red Khmers and Khieu Samphan was former head of state.
Under the governments of the Red Khmers, which had relied on a mixture of maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, life was lost as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and execution of more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the population then.
In 2010, the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia handed over a life sentence to this commander of the notorious S-21 Prison.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they acted in the best interests of the nation and did not know what the real extent of killing was.
"It is easy to say that I should know everything, understand everything and then intervene and correct the situation," Khieu Samphan said in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said that he had never ordered the Khmer Rouge to "worship people or kill them to deny them food or genocide".
But he admitted "moral responsibility" to the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Fifteen-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives under the Red Khmer regime, said the AFP agency could not accept an apology from Nuon Chea."
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be exonerated."
"She doesn't care about the second," she said.
"If he hadn't given the orders, they wouldn't have killed him," she added, adding that the leader of the Khmer Rouge is "worse than a monster".
He was also to stand before the court for the "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the regime of Red Khmer Ieng Sara, who died this March.
His wife Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, found in September 2012 an incompetent trial for dementia.
Red Khmer leader Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to collect manual luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to $100 during its years for storing the manual luggage on board.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 per hand luggage and $2 per coffee or soda, although in their announcement on Wednesday, passengers will be able to keep the whole can.
The new charge for the hand luggage concerns luggage in the upper storage space, so the small luggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says he will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if the passengers pay the payment wait until the entrance to the gate.
Frontier Kate O'Malley's spokeswoman said that the $100 fee should encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We would not like to collect this fee," she said.
Air companies started charging the first and second luggage submitted in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and poured into the manual luggage hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so there was often no room in this space.
Fees are one of the ways travelers learn to take less stuff on board.
O'Malley said that the purpose of this new fee really isn't to get more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it very clear that finding a place in the upper storage space is increasingly difficult.
Travelers who buy tickets on the company’s website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in the front gate of Frontier can bring a luggage for which he will pay nothing, while the other passenger in the front will pay $100 for the same luggage.
O'Malley said that the websites and shipping procedures would be adjusted to ensure that passengers learn about the fee before they come to the gate.
The new Frontier fee for the hand luggage will not be valid until summer, but the date has not yet been fixed.
Travelers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of luggage costs money, and the passengers who demand it should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see another charge for the luggage as a sign that airlines are trying to choose enough money to cover the costs of air traffic after years of loss.
Most of the time, however, there was no fee for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines first paid for hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost company, Allegiant Air, followed suit.
The only company that also has such fees is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says air traffic advisor Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s hand luggage fee would be USD 50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former chief worker of Midwest Airlines, recently flew to Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered an unusual charge from Spirit for hand luggage.
"It was the busiest thing I had ever seen in my flight career," he said.
I expected to see teeth and quarrels creaking at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, “and the landing took place in the blink of an eye. ”
The Frontier also uses Spirit as a model the fee for coffee, tea, soda and juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and coffee will be added free.
The water will continue to be delivered free of charge.
In 2008, US Airways made a brief attempt to introduce a fee for drinks, but after complaints from passengers seven months later, no other important airline resembled it.
Frontier’s latest move to pay for the hand luggage if the passengers do not buy the flight directly from this airline is her final effort to direct the customers directly to her website.
Air companies pay internet travel salesmen, such as Orbitz, between 10 and 25 USD for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, instead of doing so through Internet travel agencies.
However, Frontier did not go further in this area.
In September, she began to give customers who bought through the Internet travel agency only half a mile under the loyalty programme.
On Wednesday, she cut the prize for the run-in miles to 25 percent of the road.
So the trip with Frontier lasts 1,000 miles purchased through the Internet travel agency means a reward of 250 miles.
Customers are also allowed to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase directly through Frontier’s website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in his home town of Denver, but her business is beginning to shrink and lose money.
According to the financial results reported by the central company partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales dropped by 9 per cent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter
The company Republic is also trying to solve Frontier’s financial problems by selling this airline.
For the collapse of the NSA website, it does not blame hackers, but "internal error"
The secret National Security Agency stated last Friday that its website fell for several hours last week due to internal error, not due to the attack of hackers, as some claimed on the Internet.
“The NSA.gov website was not available for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during the regular update,” the spy agency said in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be removed during tonight.
The claim that the accident was caused by an attack by DDoS (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Earlier this evening, sensors online servers recorded that the NSA website did not work for at least six hours, and pages are still unavailable for some users.
Former NSA spokesman ABC News reported that the internal sensitive networks of the agencies were not “in any way” at risk.
The speaker said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of hackers on the Internet claimed to be responsible for eliminating NSA sites through DDoS.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers are overloaded and the site falls.
This cyber strategy is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA super-secret agency, formerly nicknamed No such agency, has become the source of foreign and domestic surveillance programs in recent months, with the attention of the public, and the target of tempting criticism, in general, of the product of estrangement of NSA secret files from the agency and their disillusionment by former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier’s profits have fallen as a result of a drop in supplies and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier reported on Thursday a 15 per cent decrease in net profit due to fewer orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
At its headquarters in Montreal, Bombardier also did not publish any data on the airworthiness test for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft will comply with an ambitious plan to launch commercial operations as of next September.
After the start of the test flight, about a month and a half ago, the plane flew only three times, raising the question of whether the test phase was progressing well.
The results did not meet estimates and stock in the Toronto Stock Exchange dropped by 8 percent.
On Thursday, State Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen dropped the "higher yield" rating on "implementation of the sector" with the expectation that the stock exchange will experience limited growth during the next quarter or two.
"While we expected largely smaller deliveries of aircraft, the profit margin in the area of transport has greatly disappointed us," said Doerksen in the report to clients.
As the test programme continues, we believe that Bombardier will receive new orders from CSeries.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect market scepticism to increase against this programme.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries-type aircraft are being breached into the lower market area, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was discovered in March and was held in September after several months of delay.
However, the number of mandatory CSeries aircraft orders reaches modest 177 because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to verify the company’s claims regarding low consumption and savings at the costs of this transport aircraft.
Currently there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
The Executive Director of Pierre Beaudoin expected 300 binding orders to be delivered to Bombardier at the first commercial use.
On Thursday, managers also assured analysts and the media that the programme was proceeding according to plan.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that the ground inspection and software updates were scheduled during the departure of the aircraft.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to graduate the first flight and then focus on updating, and we did.
That's what's going to happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and the rest shortly thereafter.
The analysts are nevertheless skeptical that the first customer could start operating CSeries for 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier claims that it has assessed its plan to put the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the coming months.
"This slow pace of flight tests – although in line with Bombardier's internal plan – is likely to strengthen our view that putting into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
Of the 172 million USD or 9 cents per share in the previous year, in the third quarter of the end of September 30th, the net profit of Bombardier fell to USD 147 million, or 8 cents per share.
The adjusted revenue for one share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The turnover marginally fell from USD 4.2 billion to USD 4.1 billion.
According to the IBES system, Thomson Reuters expected analysts to receive 10 cents per share and turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer stated that he had only added 45 aircraft to 57 aircraft a year earlier during the quarter.
Clean orders dropped from 83 planes to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the Air Division amounted to 32.9 billion by 30 September, which does not change until 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our perspectives, but the low receipt of orders and the overall situation of the market disappointed us," Beaudoin said.
The return in the aviation industry decreased by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said that income in this division had increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled contracts in transport amounted to 32.6 billion by 30 September, which is marginal growth compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
The heads of staff said that new prospects would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced the arrival of Google Financial Director Patrick Pichette, decreased by 8.5 per cent on Thursday afternoon during trading to $4.83.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest producer of commercial aircraft and the closest competitor of Bombardier, announced on Thursday a ten-percent decline in the quarterly profit.
The cocaine lawyer who warned the mob about police investigation is in prison.
Bashaat Ditta (42) was to pass information on to the King of the Underworld, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid his drug addiction would come out.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who informed a drug mobster about a major police investigation because he feared that his drug addiction would come out, he was sentenced to three years in prison.
Bashaat Ditta (42) had, after becoming a suspect in cocaine use, Neil Scarbrough's head of the underworld to provide sensitive information on the investigation of his drug smuggling activities.
A lawyer whose nickname was "Bash" (party) and who was celebrated as the best legal representative was arrested at home in 2011, following the police monitoring of Scarborough in previous drug proceedings.
The officers saw Sarborough (32) leaving at the attorney's house in Blackcashire, which was just having dinner with his colleagues from the Legal Society, three bags of cocaine.
Based on tests of cocaine traces in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular user of Class A drugs.
During the period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he tried to obtain information on the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his partner.
All four suspects were then monitored as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After police detained heroin and cocaine worth about GBP 1.5 million in cash during a series of raids, another 32 people ended up in prison.
Ditta (42) reported information to criminals out of fear that he would become addicted to cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works with the Forbes Solicitors legal firm based in Blackburn, experienced a disgraceful time before the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty after a three-week trial that he was defending justice in two cases.
During his earlier hearing, he confessed to holding cocaine.
The lawyer’s fall came after the Scarborough police investigation found that he was in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives of the suspect watched, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and saw him place drugs with 60 percent purity under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Subsequently, Scarborough was with Ditto, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned home where he found the drugs, and nine interviews took place between the two.
The court heard that traces of Class A drug were found in his hair, his wallet, and his credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, and said that he spoke to a suspected dealer because he was his client and argued that their conversation was part of “confidential communication”.
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards from it, but they were all detained and hair samples were taken from him.
During his police questioning, he said that he operated the office both at his home address and at the workplace, and that clients visited him at home for work.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted important players in the drug supply chain, some of which he had previously represented to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who else is more aware that he must not violate the law than an attorney in the criminal area. ”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as attorney and of getting in too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just about a drug dealer, but about a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his interviews were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the legal-client relationship.
The police investigation dreamed as much as he could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't bring his profession a good reputation, he disrespected her.
He got too close to some of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be violated.
Ditta refused and declared: “If I were a corrupt lawyer that I am not, and I would like to pass on information to Mr Scarborough, I would not expect 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
After hearing the police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire, however, said: “Mr. Ditta became a criminal himself when he started getting drugs from organised criminals. ”
His dependence on cocaine made him hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the intents of the leading leaders of the organised crime groups, which gave him the task of gathering valuable information on police investigation.
Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and should inspire confidence and trust in the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crimes Unit in Lancashire led an investigation against Mr Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted in three cases of cocaine possession and now in defence of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bring the criminals to justice.
This case should serve all criminals as a warning that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We will find you and stand before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being declared guilty of association in order to supply heroin, cocaine and hemp.
Another thirty-five persons involved in trafficking were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website Ditta organized an online interview about himself, in which he said that his dream work would be lawful to represent clients from the block of death in America, as a guest at dinner he would wish Mohammed Ali and as a motivation for work stated inequality.
He was negotiating a government with Klaus and Speedle.
Now John Kasal's men have sent against Babish.
In the election, the people won fourteen Members, i.e. only a third of the social Democrats or the representatives of YES.
But they enter negotiations on the government with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to guess the outline of a possible coalition, they have John Kasala - the man who, for a human being, arranged the terms of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats and Andrej Babiš do not have such a matador on their side.
This time, perhaps, it will be a reminder of the first negotiations in 1992, when ODS was also a completely new party.
"Experiences were minimal then," Cassal estimates how talks will develop this year.
Kenyan press outraged by the controversial media law
“It’s a terrifying report and it’s on the spot to ask what Parliament will prevent tomorrow simply from removing the independence of the judiciary”, the newspaper, which considers the bill to be constitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of the Capital Group, including CapitalFM, one of the most recognised independent radio stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be pre-op because it is an extended government hand" and that restrictions on content and advertising will damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will hear us out, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members," he said.
According to the Star Bill's proposal to the government in fact, the "complete control of the media" and the Standard newspaper state that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya "strengthened a severe wound" and criticise the bill's proposal as "stricken".
Approval of the bill comes in the middle of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack of the Islamic gunman at the Westgate shopping centre.
The anger of the authorities turned the Kenyan media against itself when it broadcast a security footage of a security camera on which soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly robbed a luxury goods deal.
The police director responded by calling two journalists and a media chief for questioning, but the appeal was subsequently withdrawn after the media pressure.
According to the new bill, media companies can fine up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million with the risk of "disposing from the list" or being denied official journalistic accreditation.
The tribunal also has the right to confiscate the assets of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “there is even one penalty to eliminate most of the radio stations. ”
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidation effect on what is called the Kenyan “living blogosphere”.
Politicians know that if they shut up the media, they can do what they want without punishment.
“You never know what can happen,” wrote the newspaper Nation Mutuma Mathiu and described the Kenyan media as a key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
"When we leave it to politicians, they will bankrupt the country and send us back to hunting and collecting," he wrote.
Legislators in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to abolish the cuts imposed by the national wage agency and to renew their fat salaries around 532 000 unbundled shillings a month, which are thus among the highest in the world.
The young Czechs know how to fight.
Most of them don't even know what interest they're paying.
There's still more Czechs taking money away.
However, they do not reach the regional savings champions.
Most of the money is spent by Racuscans, who contribute on average 181 euros a month.
A little more than Czech people will dispute in Slovakia.
This comes from the Erste Savings Barometer survey in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of the pagers is improving, and two thirds of the respondents are planning to spend more money on the side.
While Czechs are in the middle of a ladder of scaffolders, people in Romania and Serbia still use very little savings products.
For example, almost every other Serb will dispute at home "under the pillow" according to the survey.
In the country this year, there have been an increase in the number of people who contribute more monthly amounts.
Last year, a thousand to two thousand crowns of 26 percent of the respondents delayed a variety of savings every month, five percent more this year.
The average monthly balance in the annual comparison has decreased slightly to 2078 crowns.
The biggest hit between savings products is pension attachment.
This favors 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to assess savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, there is a decline in the trend towards building savings, as compared to last year, there is also a marked decline in interest in investment funds.
You already used only 16 percent of the respondents, while last year it was almost a quarter of the people.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to encourage, most of them do not know what incomes are made on individual products.
Above all, young people under the age of 30 do not know how their money is engaged.
On the contrary, the best awareness of the return on its saved money has the oldest group of respondents, among people over 50 years of age, 73 percent of those questioned know it.
In the international comparison group Erste Czechs lead to the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by the Slovaks and the Raccoons with a 12 per cent tolerance.
UN celebrates new goals against poverty
The United Nations is beginning to work without delay on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set up 12 years ago to address global poverty.
Prior to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting the "sustainable development goals" to replace MDG, which will expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of a document that will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary General Mr. Ki-moon said overnight at the summit that it is now time to "get up above national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to set out the general objectives of sustainable development – SDG," he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made in the framework of the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to carry out our vision of the sustainable development goals that the MDG is building on.
Concerns about the safety of Mozambique are escalating because of the conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samora Machela, the founding President of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to make peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
Out of concern for the future of her country, she changed her business clothes for a T - shirt “we demand security” in Portuguese and joined a crowd in the City of Independence on Thursday.
After two weeks, nearly daily reports of conflicts between the government forces and the Renamo side were received, about some of the worst conflicts since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, originally supported by the Belarusian government in Rhodesia and then by the Government of Apartheid in South Africa in an effort to destabilise the independent government of that country.
After a peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that it is unlikely that an open conflict will erupt again in the country, but recent events have frightened foreign investors and local investors.
A fast-growing economy is at stake, as the discovery of large-scale coastal oil reserves and coal bearings in the northwest can bring investments worth more than $50 billion over the next few years, such as Brazil's Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy's Eni and America's Anadarko.
The ruling party Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo have blamed each other for the tension that has arisen.
The Renamo party claims that the government sparked the recent conflicts by launching an attack on their members in the province of Sofa, the traditional garden of the Renamo Party on 17 September.
The violent attack of the former rebels came to a climax when government forces attacked the base of the Renamo party and tried to kill Afons Dhlakama, the leader of the group, told the Financial Times spokesman of Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government is accusing Renamo of starting conflicts because he said he was attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza was concerned about the instability.
Mr Guebuza for the French press office AFP said on Wednesday that Mr Dhlachama saw himself as a “loser” who wanted to use “anything that remained of his strength to try to prove that he could direct his own decisions to the government”.
Both Frelima and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
However, concerns increased when Mr Mazang’s words were quoted as saying that the Renamo party deviated from the 1992 peace agreement.
The letter FT said that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to go back to the negotiations, but seriously," said Mr Mazanga.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to ease the tension between these parties, blown up by a number of clashes this year.
It is a tie between two large personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said the lecturer at the Open University and expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them is a good negotiator and neither is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which sought election changes, has already expressed itself that it would boycott the municipal elections planned for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort by the shrinking movement to gain advantages and financial gain from the government.
Renamo's electoral share has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by the former member of the Renamo party, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza – to whom the second term ends next year – wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
"He doesn't want a democratic system of parties, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidential office," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what the Renamo party has to do, but it has carried out vicious terrorist attacks on police stations and on vehicles on a key road between the north and the south.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofa, which is several hundred kilometres away from the capital of Maputo, but where the city of Beira is, the port to which mining companies rely, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on when exporting coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week when Renamo threatened to attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga didn't want to raise his question about Renamo repeating his threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good”, Mazanga said.
Unstableness has increased government frustration, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent flood of kidnapping.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president and that it should be the one who finds solutions to problems," he says.
Demonstrator Omar Sultane says people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to roads," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for life, ” says the author.
The stories about Thor can show that “the strong force cannot be equal to the cunning” while the artusian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Much of the myths would “be too savage for schooling, too scandalous, and in some cases too outrageous”, said Crossley-Holland, who is applying for careful selection of works of age.
"I think it is great that myths and human creation are already part of education," he said.
I've had this plan for 20 years.
He added that “openly instructing” authors and teachers are in a serene story with a “prag” message for children as a “offer”.
Crossley-Holland, who translates from English into Beowulf and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Warlocks, says: “You can have good intentions, but you will do better if you keep them to yourself.”
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult writer who writes to adults and an adult writer who writes for children needs some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end up happy, but there has to be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be unconscious; revealed through the story, not openly established.
The old truth is it's better to show than to describe.
Brno's starry takes visitors to space in a new digital theater
At first sight, the Great Planetary Hall has changed over the past six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can crash into new comfortable seats and a projection area of 17 metres in diameter from the American company Spitz has come over their heads.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, the new projector from Japan.
To be perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the room.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It is twenty-one computers that generate the painting," said the director of the Brno Starry Jiří Dušek.
The computer will ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a complete impression.
"The work of computers is thirty-four times higher than that of classical personal computers," said technician Tomáš Hladík.
The digitization can be mastered by an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body or the ocean floor.
The viewers are so noticeable right in the middle of the universe or the brain of man.
Another similar facility is closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The head of the starry is planning to show off the shows and his own creation in the room.
There's been two shows on the show since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People will learn about spaceman training, fly out into space, focus on centrifuges, and then see the challenging conditions of astronauts facing space.
The second show is for children and my name is Kowzelný úte - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colorful inhabitants lived a quiet life until the explosion of a nearby volcano.
The entire digitization cost about 50 million crowns, mostly paid by the Ministry of Education.
With smaller amounts, the city of Brno and the starry from its budget also contributed.
The projection area cost ten million crowns, projector 12 million.
"The rest was combined with audiovisual techniques and computers," explained Dušek.
The installation of digitium followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the starry passed two years ago.
According to Director Duska, by the end of the year, there could be 25 to 30,000 visitors.
We studied 11 THOUSAND INZERS!
We know where they want you to go to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 adverts offering jobs, of which 4,300 were published in daily printing and 6,800 adverts (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet thus becomes the most important medium for publishing job offers.
In 2005, when the survey took place for the first time, 26 percent of the survey took place.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), it stood at around 60 percent.
The work opportunities' advocacy, according to the analysis, reflects a significant degree of current labour market situation.
An example can be a simple comparison of the number of advertisers published during the period of economic prosperity and during the economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, nearly 25,900 ads were published in the same period, less than half of them in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented towards a narrower, in particular a more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the daily job offer covers a wider range of professions, including those workers, according to the author of the analysis of Pavlín Happy.
The degree of representation of selected professional groups varies with both media.
On the Internet were the leading spots of adverts looking for managers and managers, business representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or small business leaders was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, and large representations include mainly service and working professions.
Of course, education is among the most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express through an advertising offer.
Other areas under surveillance included knowledge of foreign languages, in particular English.
In the daily press, a demand for foreign language knowledge was made in three percent of ads, 37 percent of the Internet.
Only two percent of employers required active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of ads (in daily print at 11 percent, on the Internet at 57 percent).
The practice in the field was required in 54 percent of ads.
The requirements for practice are linked in part to qualified professions.
In particular, it is the production manager and other managers.
In particular, in the case of workers' professions, mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical appliances, the author of the study Jiří Tillner added.
Employers also include in half of their adverts the characteristics and skills of potential candidates.
As the most often required skills, communication skills have been introduced in the first place for a long time.
Furthermore, employers require flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, autonomy, responsibility, organizational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: 10th anniversary of New York's Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be argued that the city of New York is the place where solo comedy performances were born in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the varietal artist Frank Fray, who worked as chairman of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the assembled people jokes by the method of the interview.
Fay's innovation spread over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, founded and controlled by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the institution of solo comedy Carolines, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – together with more than 60 performances in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the point that they are too big to play in the club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", the annual musical comedy benefit performance at Madison Square Garden, which includes Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
Just as this festival spread, the world of comedy spread.
Several comedians attending this year's festival came from unconventional channels such as the show in small radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll got high with his sitcom (he's happy to have a spicy "League" on a fantastic football theme on FXX) and now he has his own comedy show at Comedy Central Station.
Jenny Slate was a member of both the “Saturday Night Live” and the “Parks and Recretion” program, but most of all she was famous for the rapidly spreading series of videos “Marcel the shell with shoes on” (must Marcel in shoes).
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly identifiable voices (serreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, fertilizing, racially focused W. Kamau Bell), are the product of a decentralised world of American comedy.
One of the biggest riders of the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a solo comedian, but became a successful TV and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he held a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
A meeting takes place in downtown Manhattan.
"This town is definitely in comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that if he was here, he would sometimes walk down the street between two buildings and say, "Man, if I lose all the money, maybe I'll live here."
Oil prices continued to drop to $96 per barrel.
The price of oil on Friday continued to decline as concerns about high stocks were balanced by the report, which showed the strengthening of the Chinese energy production sector.
The US oil indicator for December deliveries dropped by $16.24 per barrel during the late morning in European electronic commerce on the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, 39 cents were down and 5.8 percent for October.
Rich stocks of oil have been burdening prices in the last few weeks.
On Wednesday, the Ministry of Energy announced that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports on Chinese production called for more demand, which showed growth in activities.
This suggests that China's economic recovery after growth, which, after the past two weak decades, rose to 7.8 per cent in the third quarter, could continue to increase.
Oil Brent, an indicator for international oil used also by American refineries, fell on the International Trade Stock Exchange in London by 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel.
Oh, no, Mr. Hasku.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not the case.
It is necessary to put pressure on Martin Hashek to remove all political functions and leave the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so weak.
Martin Haszek is protected by the promise he made, but everyone and the politics in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that the politician has (Mr Babiš has the material one, but it is a matter of whether they are politicians).
A better program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
He doesn't apologize in politics, he resigns in politics.
Mr. Hasek, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements are making me firm in this, if you haven't just lied - here you see how complicated it is with lying), you leave politics alone as a man.
Then people will accept your apology as an expression of a man who made a mistake and bears his responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a spineless weak, whose words and deeds cannot be trusted.
You want to be proud, be you a missing person or a lifetime skateboard.
You may find it unfair to speak only to you, but you are the leader and they are only the wrong sheep.
And you're a leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand that now you're trying to close your ears for a while, regroup your powers, sit down the shame, and then attack again, but that's how partisans or scoundrels behave.
You, again, are in your eyes leader, alpha male, so act like one.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
The Court blocked the regulation concerning the process of stopping and searching persons by the NYPD Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal blocked a court order requiring changes in the arrest and search of persons in the New York Police Department and the judge dismissed the case.
The second U.S. Federal Appeal Court said that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the appeal which the city filed.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its programme for stopping and questioning people.
The city of its conclusions and its amending regulation had been concerned, including the decision to grant surveillance to the police department, which would help to change its procedures and its training programme with them.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard arguments for the delay requested.
The Court of Appeal said that the judge had to be dismissed from the case because she had got into a conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, by not acting as a judge on the requirement to avoid the appearance of the imagination, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and a public statement that had openly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge decided that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they were wrongly targeting blacks and Hispanics within the framework of their programme for the arrest and search of persons.
It established independent supervision to monitor major changes, including reform of procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the launching of a pilot programme to test the cameras carried out on the body in certain areas where people are most frequently stopped.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the method of retaining names and the address of people whose cases were rejected after police search.
The oral justification for the appeal of the city is sometimes scheduled after 14 March 2014.
Stop and search tactics have criticised a number of civil rights defenders.
In a certain form there has been stopping and searching people for about a number of decades, but recorded searches under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically increased to a record number of 684 330 in 2011, in most cases it was blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men who all belonged to a minority, a lawsuit that became a case of group action.
The proponents of amendments to the police department’s stopping and searching programme claim that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police department, and may influence the use of these practices by other police departments.
Opponents argue that changes will reduce police morality, but not crime, and that money will be wasted, but that the wider problem will not be solved when the police force is under pressure after its numbers have decreased by several thousand in the last decade.
The judge noted that she had not completed the practice of stopping and searching persons who were constitutional, but had reformed the way in which the police department’s examinations in New York had been introduced.
Five shopping centers face low attendance
This results from data from Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle real estate consulting companies.
In Prague Bohnice is opening the public Trade Center of Krakow, will be the 19th Prague shopping centre.
There are now 90 large business centres in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfying performance accounts for about 20 percent of medium and large centers.
The main problems are inadequately large center towards locality and bad layout, that is, too much floor or complicated and opaque passage arrangements, or dead places center," said Michal Sotak of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also according to retail property manager Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about five shopping centers face low attendance.
The main reasons include poor transport availability, low reception categories of local residents or overcrowding of the market in a given location.
Some projects opened almost completely, but their results were mostly unsatisfactory at first.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
The new business centres must try harder to attract their customers to new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
According to Soták, the availability of shopping centres is generally stable, even at some centers it rises because the tenants were willing to reduce their rent and rent some units in the crisis.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently opened, which are not fully occupied and the average coverage is thus reducing (for example Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)," added Sotak.
Trade centres opened in the past two years on the market are being promoted according to Sylvia Samadi very slowly.
But there is a market place for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a building space for a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is definitely room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinence centres', aimed at buying and serving daily needs for the population living in the immediate vicinity," Samadi said.
According to Soták, there is also a place on the domestic market for other shopping centres.
Both for small 'service' centres and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
"Places like Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," added Sotak.
In Prague, they see the space for the prepared business centre on the Victory Square, and according to it they have the clear potential of the streets Na Příkopa and Václavské náměstí.
"The expansion of retail parks, which enable traders to cover and expand into increasingly smaller cities at favourable rental and operating costs, is also available in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, as well as their reconstruction such as the reconstruction of the Prior merchant houses, which benefit from the good locality," Dita Kubanková from DTZ added.
In the Czech Republic there are currently 90 modern shopping centres with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross rental areas.
A quarter of all these shopping centers are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, nine are in Prague, according to Incoma GfK's data.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic is lagging about 50 square meters per thousand population.
Coulson hacked into his phone to check the tip.
The former editor of the news News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson allegedly used methods of “crowding into the phone, tracking and confrontation” to confirm the fraudulent tip on the love relationship to which the then interior minister Charles Clarke was to be involved.
State Attorney Andrew Edis at Old Bailey's court said that the News of the World caught false news in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his “attractive special advisor” Hannah Pawlby.
The press charged a private investigator named Glenn Mulcaire with breaking into Pawlby's voice box and breaking into her privacy, but the court also heard Coulson calling her and leaving her voice messages.
"The state attorney suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the man who stands in front of the house and hopes that people will catch outside, but a man who likes to push people's stories to see what they say," Mr Edis said.
He said that NotW newspapers used three ways of exploring stories: breaking into phones, tracking and confrontation.
The Editor is personally involved in the third method.
Apparently, he knows about the other guy, the surveillance, he needs to know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the break-in on the phone?
He says no, we say, “But surely he knows. ”
The fans of the love relationship Clarke is involved in were first captured by the NotW news reporting department, when the source that was sexually interested in Mrs Pawlby was said to be, "You're wasting your time, she's with Charles."
The recording with voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the private investigator's computer, where Mrs Pawlby and her sister were referred to as “Projects”.
During the time Mrs. Pawlby was investigated, her grandparents received anonymous calls requesting information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief rapporteur Neville Thurbeck and former rapporteur James Weatherup were overseeing Mrs Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voice message saying to her: “I have got a story that we are about to publish tomorrow, and I would love to talk to Charles about. ”
Mr. Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was according to the same model as other important personalities, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
On Thursday, the court heard Coulson confronting Mr. Blunkett for a romantic relationship with a married woman, while he was seeing his fellow defendant, Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied association with other persons for the purpose of breaking into phones from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurbeck and Weatherup confessed to breaking into the phone.
Uncovering NSA increases state-based social paranoia
One peaceful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the US Consular Office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the direction of the Federal Institute Protection Office (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was to obtain photographs of the roof of the US forward patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media claims that the BfV hoped that it would be able to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this event triggered an exchange of views in Berlin between the US and the German Foreign Minister.
James Clapper, U.S. National Reporting Director, reiterated in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits”.
But since Edward Snowden, who became an informant from a co-worker, began to reveal his valuable collection of covert surveillance by the United States, European governments and leading entrepreneurs no longer know whether the Director’s words are to be trusted.
Following reports that the US National Security Agency has been spying in Brazil's oil company and has gained access to data available to US cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, there has been general paranoia on the state's monitoring of new dimensions.
The last drop came with the discovery that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone may have been tapped for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be the target, they are certainly both potential targets and leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden looked at intensive cooperation between American intelligence services and companies.
I'd say it's possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"The German must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, representing a small and medium IT company in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by EY, German companies believe that as far as industrial espionage and data theft are concerned, the US now presents as much a risk as China.
However, there is no evidence in all the documentation revealed by Mr Snowden so far that the United States has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians voiced concern that the EU lacks certain skills in the area of IT and the Internet and said that it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
The front businessmen are skeptical about this.
From the German Parliament there are voices saying that we should produce a German Google.
All I can do is close my eyes and slowly open them...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German SAP software company.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to car and farmer.
Everything except IT industry.
The scope and technical complexity of American spy agencies discovered by Snowden is a shock to some companies who have so far believed that China is the biggest surveillance threat, yet shocking.
There is a major turn-over in cloud computing technology, where European representatives have become more aware that data stored in the US falls under the same jurisdiction and is therefore potentially offensive.
According to a survey carried out by the trading community, Cloud security alliance, about 10 percent of non-American members, after disclosure of the U.S. programme, Prism cancelled plans to use cloud provider based in the USA.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP's CEOs, says: “We have a new question for customers who haven't been here a year ago - where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction?"
Many German high-ranking figures argue that the latest reports are merely a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets and that these data must be protected at all costs.
That there's economic espionage, it's no surprise.
It's always been happening.
"It has been a major topic for many years and it has not changed significantly even during the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, as we are spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally do not want to boast of the countermeasures they have made not to give the attacker an advantage, as appropriate.
In the case of large companies, it has been recalled for a long time that taking a free memory USB drive to the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Board of Automobile Audi, says that for many years it has been common practice to collect before a board meeting mobile phones so that they can not be used as listening devices.
The German office of BfV advises managers to consider whether to not use easily prepaid mobile phones on foreign roads because of the risk that smart phones can be embezzled.
The prepaid mobile phones will then be fired.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their specific areas.
"Small experience, staff and financial resources are often lacking in SMEs to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorised approaches," BfV warns in its report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post of the American National Intelligence Estimate, in February France next to Russia and Israel, in a second row of perpetrators involved in the hacking activity for economic rapporteurs, right behind China.
A board member in a German risk-free company concluded that as far as economic espionage is concerned, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in one of the interviews this month: “The services know very well that all countries, although working together in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies. ”
The parents of an underage boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of an underage boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a confused wrestler's clergyman in a gymnasium of his high school, believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of the city of Valdosta in Georgia on January 11th was found carved in a flat spiritual following the bleachers at a gymnasium school where he went.
Sheriff's field investigators at Lowndes County have concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of a 17-year-old youth rejects it.
"They are absolutely convinced that their son was murdered," said lawyer Benjamin Crump, representing Kenneth and Jacques Johnson.
They never believed that he died the way the sheriff said he did.
"They are convinced that it opposes logic, physical laws and common sense," Crump said.
They believe that this is to cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son’s death.
"As they usually sent their son to school, and he returned to them in a bag of corpses," he said.
State Attorney Michael Moore said he was conducting a regular investigation into Johnson's death on Thursday, and noted that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a consequence of the crime?
He announced Moore at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts wherever they take me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a normal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of “sufficient suffocation. ”
However, according to Moore, another cause of death was reported.
"There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he reveals enough evidence in the case of Johnson's death to investigate a crime or violate civil rights, he will ask the FBI and its execution.
The deputy sheriff's office at Lawndes district wasn't immediately available on Thursday for any comment.
A judge from South Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to make available all the videos from the surveillance cameras that the investigators looked at.
The parents of a youth hope that the videos will contain a clue leading to revealing how their son died.
CDC Centre for Schools Directive on Allergy in Children
At the centre of the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help in the case of child allergy to food at school.
This is the first set of such directives issued by the U.S. government, because the number of children of school age who suffer from food allergies is rising.
One of the 20 children in the United States is allergic to food.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The Directives contain information for schools on how to notify teachers and staff about child allergies to foods and how to respond to allergic reactions if they occur.
Schools also recommend that adrenaline be available – the most often used is an automatic EpiPen brand injector – to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
The state legislative authorities have recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that occur in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child may say, “It’s like someone is banging on my tongue, ”“ I feel like I have hair on my tongue, ” or “My tongue is itching. ”
Parents of Intersexual Children can choose “uncertain sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise the third sex in children born with ambiguous sexual structure.
Newborn children will no longer be assigned only to male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to indicate any gender for such children, allowing them to identify sex as “unspecified” or “unspecified ” on their birth certificates.
The aim of the law is to stop pressured parents to decide quickly with their child to perform surgery to determine sex, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersexual.
One BBC intersexual said after many years: “I am neither man nor woman. ”
I'm gonna stay the bacon made by a doctor, crippled and scarred.
It is estimated that every year 2,000 children are born with one that is neither boy nor girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of gender-related development disorders, covering the deadline for those with atypical chromosomes, sexual glands (voices or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
The definition of sex is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that if the sex cannot be identified, it is better to use the best available information and identify it, instead of waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of the child until the operation is carried out, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender problems, said that the new German law “seems to be a good thing. ”
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening state that requires surgery, but for most children it is not so," he said.
Determining sex can be done without surgery and then you can wait for your identity to develop.
The knowledge of how a child develops sexual affiliation is not too accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both of them and cannot be clearly defined as either of them.
These traits may manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, busts and character, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sexual structures, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersexual and transsexual people in the workplace, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
The boys who do not match any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal allow adults to list male, female or “third sex” in official documents.
In June, Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first recognized "sexless" person when she won a court appeal to retain the status of "undetermined" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will be given except for M (man) and F (woman) and third markings, X, for inter-sexual persons.
In neighbouring France, according to a report on France, 24 gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this strongly Catholic country signed a petition to remove “the theory of sex from school textbooks. ”
The American Catholic website online also defined the German law and wrote: “With the way the world is drawn to a new state, where sex is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we are turning two other pillars of civilization. ”
A newborn mother from Maryland also said to Baby Zone that she would rather see children be given sex at birth.
“Praternity itself is stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the sex of your child,” she said for the website regarding parental care.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites, according to the handsome Greek who had double sex.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that sex was something like a board that could be deleted and rewritten.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation, that sexual belonging is a complex matter and that doctors can sometimes make wrong decisions because they do not know how children will feel when they grow up because of their gender.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The continuing theory of how to deal with children of uncertain sex was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who maintained the view that sex was subject to sex.
He created a new concept of “sexuality” and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment — as their parents raised — affected children’s genes and hormones and formed a child regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as “John/Joan, ” his theory became controversial.
The parents of a boy whose penis was damaged by a badly executed circumcision recommended that his child be completely castrated, removed from his testicles and brought up as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different," said Drescher.
When the boy was 15 years old, he got his surgery back on the boy and married his wife.
At 38 years of age, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “use this model ” today.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, survivors of these operations appeared to be “dissatisfaction with the result. ”
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36 - year - old writer in Montana who was born with male chromosomes but with a vague sexual structure.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he could never live “a satisfying life”.
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from the outside organs and testicles and raised as a girl.
When he was 12 years old, he got female hormones.
“I knew I was not a girl,” said ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18 he was sent to vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
After I was born, I was sterilized, and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with gender disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his sexual structure.
After he learned the truth, he changed back to men, took doses of testosterone, and had his breasts removed,
The surgery caused his infertility.
Today she represents others in the organization called Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the legal group Advocates for informed choice (the deputy of informed elections) based in California, fears that the German law "calls for sensitization and stigmatisation".
"Many activists fear that the German law will achieve that it will encourage parents to make quick decisions and choose “uncertain” for the child," she said.
We're afraid it's going to trigger an intervention.
We think it's better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law ends up, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organisation supports the Australian law because it "allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own decision on the legally applicable sex," she said.
The German law is about to assign him at birth.
This is a battle that a little child shouldn't seduce at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions.
But Dr. Arlene Baratzová, a chest radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a gender disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law would “give power” to both parents and children.
Daughter of Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has DSD called Androgens Insensitiveness Syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, Katie developed female traits.
She has a vagina, but she has no uterus and no ovaries.
Now she is a 29-year-old Katie married and works as an intern at the University of Pennsylvania in child psychiatry.
Even though she is barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogate motherhood.
"The law will give parents a certain space to take their decision so that they don't rush," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do certain tests and to think about it, and it gives them time to write “man” or“ woman”.
In this respect everything is fine – you are raising your child and loving him.
You have an amazing child, and you're happy about it.
You don't have to rush an operation that's irreversible.
"It provides an opportunity to involve the child in decision-making and takes away the anxiety that binds the parents because they have no assurance that they are doing the right thing," she said.
Eventually, the child will decide which sex is more identified – and that is a great thing.
This gives children the authority to make their own decisions.
The drunkard poured gasoline all over the house: He threatened to burn him down with his own family!
The tension went up, the fear got worse.
The man started threatening to set the whole house on fire.
As a result, all available police patrols in the area, as well as firefighters unit from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of voluntary firefighters, went to the scene.
A police negotiator also came to the scene, who tried to talk his irrational behavior out of it.
The man continued to threaten to set the house on fire.
So there must have been an intervention unit in the house, which destroyed the man and restrained him.
The aggressor then ended up in an exam at the youthoboleslav hospital, where he was transferred to an anti-alcoholic captured station.
Finally, firefighters poured gasoline over the house with sorbent, which they later cleaned up.
In addition, all domestic animals were saved from the house.
He didn't put a man on a police negotiator, so he took command of him.
Report: Obama's campaign considered replacing Biden as Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisor, according to the New York Times, secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden as Hillary Clinton's 2012 candidate.
This revelation is the most important sensation of the impatiently expected 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann “Double down: Game Change 2012. ”
The Times magazine received a copy of the coming books and announced on Thursday evening that the President’s top associates had held intensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to assess whether the removal of Bidena would help revive Obama’s dazzling hope of re-election.
According to a national-political correspondent for the Times magazine, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of campaign leaders and the White House, namely the former White House Head of the Bill Daley White House, to measure the impact on the election by the former Secretary of State Clinton on the post of vice president.
Potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president's closest advisors — including Daley, former chief of the Obama campaign, Jim Messina, and former chief advisors at the White House of David Axelrod and David Pluffe — knew that this change was being considered.
The book Double Down claims that Daley was the representative of the effort to replace Biden despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make this move when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would not significantly increase the chance.
In his interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration really considered the replacement of Biden Clinton.
"I have studied a lot of things intensively and this was one of them," said Daley.
You can't forget that the president had terrible prospects at the time, so we were like, "Christophane, what are we supposed to do?"
While Daley characterized research as “a proper care”, Martin told Anderson Cooper from CNN that the re-election campaign had spent a small investment to see if this move would pay off in the elections.
"In campaigns such money is not spent on elections and qualitative research unless something is seriously considered," Martin said at AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about this potential card mix.
While Daley said that he did not think that the president was “aware of the potential changes”, the former head of the office admitted that it was“ possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book Double Down definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe reached Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research on the removal of Biden from the candidate.
"Perhaps," Martin replied.
Fantastic ice cream that glows in the dark?
The British entrepreneur produced the first ice cream that glows in the dark using a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a glowing monument.
He came up with an idea when he read an expert agreement on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce a protein that causes light-signalling.
This ice cream reacts with the language of the consumer – increases the pH of the protein and then causes it to glow.
Chris says the ice cream glows when he responds with the warmth of your mouth, and that's why the more you lick, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company “Lick me I’m delicate” says: “It’s an amazing substance, but as far as production is concerned, we’re in the beginning, so for 200 GBP you get about 2 g of this substance.”
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats the protein, your pH rises and the ice cream begins to glow.
We've been testing it over the last few months, and it seems to be a great idea for Halloween's celebration, because it's causing this fantastic glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because jellyfish lighting is four times more expensive than gold.
And so I'm worth about 140 GBP every step of the way.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
His next product is to be even more ambitious.
He says, “I would really like to make an invisible ice cream. ”
In its essence, it's impossible because of the break in light of the ice crystals that make ice cream, but I'm counting on us to find some way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: According to numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat sweets, stay up a long time and introduce ourselves to our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a caregiver.
After two years, no sugar showed up in my apartment, and this year probably won't be any different.
However, statistics show that I am, as far as Halloween is concerned, a black sheep.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), most Americans – in fact 158 million of them – will celebrate Halloween this year and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and ornaments.
But every time I look forward to Halloween, there are trends.
According to NRF, $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion lost is expected to go to costumes.
This year are the last shot of fashion sexy inanimate objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; sexy food can be like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect that thanks to the parade of the dead we will see a lot of zombies, and I bet spacemen from Daft Punk will reach our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google they are the most wanted zombie costumes, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year, we wore our dogs to costumes, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, the Americans are spending $330 million this year on animal-loving costumes.
So she's gonna see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't waste any time.
According to Nielsen, the Americans are spending $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million kg of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is an amazing message for 41 million collectors who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to invade our neighborhood.
In fact, during Halloween, we buy, and believe me, and we consume, 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candies, and yet, according to the National Association, sugar candies around Halloween will sell almost 16,000 tons.
That's about 9 billion individual maize candy.
It's a secret I've never solved.
Nothing is more typical for Halloween than creepy houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror behind the walls" and "The house of shock" (The house of shock).
In fact, there are in the United States officially dedicated 1,200 creepy houses that according to the company of American Houses profit 500 million dollars, and this includes those amazing photos that you're pissing off fears and that your friend will put on Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person that you like will look at the picture and post a comment as "nice-looking".
Not much about pumpkin after all.
As we were young, Charlie Brown introduced us to a great pumpkin (Great Pumpin) and cutting down the pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – we do it from a little bit.
Fortunately for us the trend “baby in pumpkin” started with the application Pinterest only last year, so most of us grew up on the idea that we cut the pumpkin instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. People Counting Authority, the Americans are spending about $106 million in pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with a flickering flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins grew this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try to cut their pumpkins weighing almost one tonne.
Announced series of Land Rover racing
The interior has racing seats and six-point safety belts as well as communication equipment.
The choice includes improved brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between individual races.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “Participants who come to Bowler have changed. ”
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure as well as an attainable way to world-class races.
We are pleased that we can offer them this path in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various racing disciplines in Britain and abroad, and that it will prepare competitors for the toughness and reality of Rally Raid races.
The development of the Defender Challenge car we really enjoyed – it will be a really exciting competition.
The Defender Challenge will also offer a school and test day in February as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: In two years we have an early election
The President of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early election to take place.
A week after the last interview for Currently.cz said that there is no other way out, and every government came out of voting last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blind man.
"It's a long time he can't stand," said Karel Schwarzenberg, saying that the life expectancy of the beginning of the election period is estimated to be two years.
With the argument that voters will hardly choose otherwise next time, they disagree, "I think it'll be a little more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the President of TOP 09 does not allow that his party could still lose voters in other elections this year (about 300,000 votes were lost in 2010).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it is clear within two months that early elections will be held, it will strengthen the ANO 2011 movement of Andreje Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babish will lose.
The turbulent situation in the CzechSSD, where President Boguslav Sobotka, after a secret meeting of the party's leadership, declared that he would remain in the leadership of social democracy, or Michal Haszek, comments Schwarzenberg on his:
"The leaders of the democratic side as little boys go behind the head of the state to enable them to turn to the side."
"I thought Mr. Hashek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I haven't seen anything so badly done in my life," said President TOP 09.
And towards President Zeman (with whom he fought for presidential office) he said: "The role of the head of the state is clear: He wants to strengthen the side."
The First Laws have already been tabled by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally presented its first draft laws in the House, including the Fari Register of Treaties, which before the elections was discussed by the House Committees, but with early elections it fell under the table.
The President of TOP 09 in the interview for Currently.cz argues that such speed is given by "these laws are necessary".
At the same time, however, the TOP 09 obviously wants to advance similar attempts from other parties.
For example, election leader ANO Martin Komářek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election fight for the idea of establishing a register of contracts "snake" program of the movement YES.
TOP 09 now took advantage of a head start - just dusted out a proposal that had stepped into the second reading of the House.
Fire Departments have come to rescue a lost puppy that's stuck 15 meters above ground on a dangerous breeding ground in a quarry.
Cockroach Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, a man who had been trapped in a quarry saw a dog come out.
The firefighters were going down the rock wall to save the dog from certain deaths.
Puppies were liberated by fire forces that came to rescue him after somehow trapped himself on a dangerous breeding ground in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
Nine months old, Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and he survived himself for three days until he was released from the quarry on Wednesday.
His owners Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were in the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he ran away, when he got into a small accident, he was feverishly followed by his lost dog and placed calls on social media.
On Wednesday, around 14:15, a bright, sandman caught sight of the stuck Ruby on a founding ground in a 15 - foot [15 m] quarry.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station rushed to the site and set off to free Ruby, using the animal transport bag to pick him up on the rock.
Tech commander of the technical rescue team Andy Clayton said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was directly in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and from the bottom.
He didn't move his eyebrow during the rescue – he was totally frozen.
But he's fine now.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
Seeing a dog is unbelievable.
The technical rescue team’s expert commander, Peter Lau, said: “Ruby was very lucky to escape. ”
There was a chance that he would get very seriously hurt or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a tour, and besides exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was afraid to look at the rescue event."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to have him in your arms again.
The vet said that if he got too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
The firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, and they were all just huge.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: “We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there.”
The firefighters were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims that after that 18-year-old Katy Perry definitely didn't leave.
During an interview for the Australian Radio Show, this pop star said that for Jagger’s 2004 song “Old Habits Die Hard ” sang accompanying vocals.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went after her.
And she said, "That was a long time ago, and now he's very nice to me."
In a statement Thursday, Jagger's (70) deputy said he categorically refused to ever make Katy Perry's proposals.
The deputy said, “Maybe he's confused with someone else. ”
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album “Prism” debuted first this week.
George Kerevan: Split Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time there is a warning that the condition for the membership of an independent Scotland in the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This gave rise to stories of passport checks in Berwick and a barbed wire along Hadrian's wave.
The truth is that Strathclyde has mentioned the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as expected – this has not been reflected in the headlines.
Nor did anyone mention that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if they do.
Given that Scotland is not in Schengen at present, the offer of continued non-conformity would be a cheap concession for Brussels for whatever the Scots really want.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And also so old that he became a digger, a novice duck, that “independence means passport checks, ” I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet, there is an interesting idea in this bearded story.
Why should independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why trade the London ham for the Brusselsn, especially now?
This is a true European story: the great postwar plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
The so-called Project Europe is officially dead as a result of the euro crisis.
Across Europe, the parties dedicated to resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency receive influence.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party of the Alternativa for Germany – founded this year – came out of nowhere and has already used nearly five million votes in the September Federal elections, essentially the “Bundestag” of the Free Democrat (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats).
At home there was always resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a crucial moment.
The savings dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the closing hand drawn on national economies, through reliance on the common currency, have led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments operating with a high budget deficit – that was true only in Greece.
Rather, it is a system of the euro that blocks its members on exchange courses favourable to German exporters – and German politicians want to keep it.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe has a disadvantage in domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to squander revenue and public expenditure – which is what Germany is calling for.
Current problems with the budget and currency are driven by a deeper cause of European small performance.
As a result of the “green” energy policy supported by Brussels – the consumer cost support code for French and German companies – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gasoline as in the United States.
This is a paralyzing expense disadvantage, as we have seen in the Grangemouth case.
Even any freezing of wages in the world would not prevent the sinking of the European petrochemical industry with cheap U.S. shale oil.
The result is a suffocating rebellion, especially in France, once an EU's enthusiastic climber.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that will keep Germany in check and enable Paris to stand up in the world at Washington level.
However, as a political legitimacy card, Berlin no longer needs and has established its own economic policy in Europe and left the worn-out French economy to its fate.
Result: The right wing of the Marine Le Penová, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional election and moved the ruling Socialists to third place.
The front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning for British laborers that they cannot assume that the fragmentation of the right will automatically be shown on the left.
How does Le Pen use his newly acquired popularity among the White Working Class?
The European elections next year would like to use it to create an anti-European bloc against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a bloc can for the first time dominate the European Parliament's history.
In doing so, I think that, in due course, the growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will merge and the euro will lose.
The EU will not disappear, but it will turn into something more freer in the sense of "Europe (superior) nations", the General de Gaulle has already preferred.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project and to reach the United States.
However, Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will remain cool with the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – there is also the possibility to notify Berlin and Brussels when they are to leave us.
I suppose that Scotland would do well in a relaxed organisation of Europe, provided that it retains its own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The government of SNP in Scotland is the most successful political movement not promoting austerity measures in Europe, which won large majority in 2011, thanks to the opposition position against the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalition of conservatives and liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now elected independence only to adopt austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Puberty: Adults previously
Research has shown that African-Americans and Hispanics reach puberty before their white-haired peers.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is approaching
It has not been shown that hormones or other chemicals are behind this.
Experts argue that an outbreak of obesity can be one of the triggers of an earlier puberty.
The trend of earlier puberty is not so obvious in boys.
The ex-rapporteur CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.
Is her mother supposed to be scared when her daughters start to grow breasts and get sick at shame when they're 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Child Doctors this week in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spent a lot of time making sure that it’s not usually a sign of rapid development towards full puberty,” said Kaplowitz.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, boasting of shame and armpits and body smell, appear earlier in girls.
In the last 40 years, however, there has been only a slight shift in the age of the first period.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years compared to the age of 12.75 in 1970.
“When breasts begin to develop, it will take at least two to three years before the first menstruation,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book ‘Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.’
The most reliable test of how puberty continues is time.
The discussion is about what activates the real start of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spur 8 years ago, the girl is considered to be “prematurely mature”.
In most cases, the process will slow or stop – which child doctors can closely monitor.
Faster growth may be a reason for endocrinologist to carry out tests to eliminate serious problems such as tumor or cyst.
There are treatment procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature aging of bones, which may eventually lead to a halt in growth and incarceration in adulthood.
The recommendations on medicines and hormonal treatment depend on the child’s age, development rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
With regard to medication, Kaplowitz is cautious, but he admits that “poverty can alleviate problems with the behavior of a girl and her feelings that she is different from her peers. ”
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They are worried that he may become pregnant or how he will manage hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock, ” recalls one woman whose daughter began her period in 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a consistent set of evidence that hormones are at fault in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys – like girls – achieve puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz promotes the assumption that obesity epidemic is the most serious reason.
In 2001 he helped carry out a study on girls aged 6 to 9 years, which combines body fat with the timing of puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country African-Americans and Hispanics tend to achieve puberty before their white male counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global perspective, early puberty patterns appear to be affected by anything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although there is a low-age agility in the face and shame in boys, the trend towards a full bloom of early puberty is not as obvious as it is in girls.
Other doctors attending the conference of the American Association of Child Doctors (AAP) added additional complexity to this topic.
Acne and boasting of shame is common even in infants and battalions.
“We need to be careful about how we identify a real puberty”, said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist from the Goryebian Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instruction from their child doctor as to how to talk to their child.
"It may be a necessity to talk to the child before you know it," Kaplowitz advised.
If you remain calm, your child will likely react well.
Girls who develop earlier need to make sure that, even though this happens prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Nadya Konvalink as a housekeeper.
Does he have a new job?
Nadya Konvalink's actress (62) appeared behind the hatch in the role of the pub, and she was very good at it.
What if a popular Czech actress planned a change of profession and went to a farm?
Nadia Konvalink showed up at James Joyce Irish pub and she was making beer.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I was just fine.
Even my boss offered to hire me and I could have a beer spin.
But I refused, I would rather stay with what I am doing today, at acting," she said with the smile of Konvalink, who was a guest on the twentieth anniversary of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey there," she said.
Nadi, a longtime friend and colleague Pavel Nový, also appeared at the event.
I'm dead, and in my new life, I can't be cold.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and that's what I'm trying to do," the actor added.
Aircraft manufacturers want seat widths, large orders are at stake
The dispute over the width of seats in the second class was raised between the aircraft’s leading manufacturers for long-distance flights, which this month triggered a bitter exchange of views on the Dubai air show.
The subject of the dispute is the width of seats provided for remote flights for the economic class – not exactly the one normally offered by airlines, but whose allocated space is the key to the eligibility for efficiency in the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industrial standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economic class, but America's main rival Boeing says it is to be decided by airlines.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sale of the largest version of their two-engine remote aircraft with the potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the rear part of the plane is dismantled – especially whether it is adjacent to 9 or 10 seats – is the basis of economic performance claims on the proposals of new aircraft "mini-jumbo".
Boeing says an improved model “777X” will transport 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm laid down by 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its model A350 will transport 350 people in 46 cm of wide economic seats spread after 9.
Huge aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertising in professional media.
Airbus now appeals directly to the public before a flight show in Dubai, where it is expected that 777X will gain an advantage with more than 100 orders.
Recently, he showed what might be the start of a new commercial war when he showed the financiers a picture showing three people crowded in a restaurant entitled "Would you like it?"
"Boeing promotes remote flights in seats lower than they are in regional turbo-powered aircraft," said Airbus chief John Leahy.
As nutrition tips change, people are bigger, but the seats on airplanes have not changed radically.
Since the beginning of the 1970s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern remote air transport, the U.S. Ministry of Health estimates that the average American weight between 40 and 49 years of age has increased by 10 percent.
According to U.S. medical records, the average American in the 21st century has a 100 cm belt.
Airbus claims that his rival stuck to the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average width of seats of newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims to have done research suggesting that an extension of the seat by 2.5 cm would improve the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
The Boeing of the dimensions of Airbus’ seats refuses and says that it is not in the capacity of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the cabin experience depends on more than just the width of the seat.
“It’s really about giving flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do things that they believe must be done to make them successful,” said the expert at Kent Craver cabin space.
They don't want us to dictate to them what they get.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers there is an essential greater space for elbows, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect returns.
Behind this dispute, the race in aircraft orders with an estimated trade in the next decades worth at least $700 billion in catalogue prices is enough to absorb the language of US and European exports.
As Reuters said in July, the deployment of seats is precisely what drives the battle between the last aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim that they achieve 20 percent better efficiency than the market leader in this segment, Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats in their latest proposals.
The Boeing performance claims depend in part on comparing the 777X model design with the 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with the 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
"The reason why Boeing does this is to push more seats, and make his planes more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, leader for the comfort of passengers in Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing models 777 are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for a thicker spread that can go hand in hand with lower charges.
“It would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from the business point of view Airbus is motivated by the threat of model 777,” said expert at the interior of Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't sell seats, but they offer airlines a supplier's catalogue so they can choose.
Traveling aircraft vendors even carry a measuring band with them to check the competitive arrangements.
While I am proud of the comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a high-density arrangement for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers model A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn't been sold yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for more cabin adjustment by offering larger seats in alleys for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industrial standards will remain unheard of, but can discourage the wave of sales of 777X.
The number of HIV infections exceeded the thousandth in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected is growing annually.
For example, in 2002, the tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later they were 121, and in 2010 they were 180.
Last year, 212 were infected and it was a record number.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases this year is over 200, I think there is no doubt," said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who for years led the Prague House of Light for Patients.
According to him, there were 165 HIV patients in the country from January to September last year, 176 of them this year.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of this September the tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, the most infected in Prague.
Their number reached 1005 in September.
In the Central Bohemian region, 206 were infected.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian region, 130 from Moravskosleski or 116 from Ustecké.
The least infected came from the Highlands, 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected with sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with blood transfusions in the past.
However, since the beginning of the testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century, he has not appeared in the Czech Republic.
Six children were born with HIV, and they were transferred from their mother.
The nonsense in Gravity's movie is, but the view is beautiful, hard experts
A fantastic film from the space of Gravity sold films in the Czech Republic for a while after the premiere.
In October, nearly 150,000 viewers saw him in the Union and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews evaluate the image positively.
Others, however, find some inconsistencies in it.
Server Lidovka.cz asked experts from a number of astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of the Starry and Planetarium Brno): I like science-fantastic films, which I consider to be modern, dream fairy tales.
The film Gravity does not exception, even though they appear to be a "physically real" performance.
No, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
I've had too much of it.
You can notice, for example, the hairs of Sandra Bullock, which do not seem to rise in a state of difficulty.
Hubb's space telescope and the International Space Station are moving on very different orbits, so they can't be seen in one shot.
Some movie viewers blame the unrealizing effect and even the whole fire behavior in a state of troublelessness.
They don't think the Skafandars would have sustained that kind of wound either.
Heroes in the film Gravity often get into conflict with different objects and suits without any major difficulties.
The criticism was not spared, nor was the history plot.
Thus, the vast tragedy on the Earth’s orbit is unrealistic, according to some who are discussing it.
Besides, she wonders why the doctor was sent to space to repair the technique.
People are arguing about "unreal" lan behavior on the boards.
She said she's acting like she was meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Starry and Planetarium of Prague): I have seen him so far only on a wide canvas, but clearly I can say, I was charming.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, but a science-fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (as much as a duty) not to stick consistently to reality.
"More than you mentioned, I was touched by the fact that three times a space station with a degradation level of technology (the last Chinese) is displayed."
"Chinese, after all, will not be as late as the end of the decade and will probably look better than it is in the movie."
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, authors are very successful in trying not to break the physical laws, and so the natural-minded viewer appreciates that in various cosmic collisions and collisions, the moment of momentum, as described by the dictionary of physics, is also very realistic about the Earth from space, including a thin layer of atmosphere and polar light, which glimmers in polar regions.
Irregularities can certainly be found in a more detailed examination.
For example, when I read the comments, I found that the preferred direction for the circulation of various space debris on the orbits appears to be reversed in some scenes before it should actually be (from the west to the east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things have been adapted to their needs, but no fundamental and heavenly mistakes against logic or natural laws have been recorded in the film, and compared to other films of similar focus it is seen that the creators have made a difference in the credibility of the events shown.
From moments that don't make sense, it's worth naming the fact that Hubbl's space telescope is orbiting in a way other than the ISS.
As a result, there is a significant difference between the speed and the rescue operations could not actually take place as shown in the film.
Then, at the time of the Kowalsky (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) department, I did not notice that the whole ISS rotated, so there is no clear origin of the power exerting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go at a moment when they are no longer moving towards each other.
New nicotine vaccine may remove pleasure from smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away pleasure from smoking cigarettes.
The only dose of vaccine has been able to protect the mouse from addiction to nicotine for life.
Before testing people, it is necessary to carry out further tests that take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says the first signs are good.
"We certainly hope that this type of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhausted all methods available on the market today, but have found that their addiction to nicotine is so strong that all current approaches are overcome," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been compiled to carry genetic information for the development of anti-nicotic antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to form a smooth stream of these antibodies.
Antibodys pursue all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting nicotine.
In mouse vaccination tests, which added nicotine, they continued in their normal activities.
But mice that have not been vaccinated “have calmed down, ” researchers said, which is a sign that nicotine has gotten into their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translation Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be given as often as possible to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, thus proving to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms liver cells into factories for the production of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for humans were completely safe, they could give themselves to children before they wanted a cigarette, and that would prevent nicotine addiction.
More likely, however, it would be used by smokers to stop.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine they will not benefit from it, and it will help them to get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but point out that further research is needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Committee for the Supervision of Corruption.
The former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, denied changing the policy of the coastal lease at the request of his political adviser, Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on the controlled property government.
On Friday, the Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) expanded its search for whether Mr Obeid had lobbied with several state ministers to rent him at Circular Quay, where Obeid was owned by two restaurants and a coffee shop, restored without having to participate in the tender procedure after his termination in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's hidden interests in these properties, based on evidence submitted on Thursday by Mr Tripodi's former deputy head of office, Lynn Ashpole.
During the years of the talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for rents to go to public competitions.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer-term contractual terms.
In 2009, rentals for companies in Circular Quay, which the Obeids received $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who served as Minister of the Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public competitions.
However, he denied that the changes had been made at Mr Obeid's request, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, insisted on a shift in government rent policy.
A copy of the calls submitted at IAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr Obeide and Tripodim and Steve Dunne, head of the port department, who came after working under Mr Obeide in the fishing department.
"Was the subject of interviews during these phone calls the development of commercial rental policy?" said Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheele Tripodi.
"No," answered Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we talked about, but definitely not this.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military aircraft attacked the target in Syria, said the responsible factor
Israeli military aircraft hit the target at the Syrian port of Lázicía on Thursday night, the responsible administrator of the Fox News administration station confirmed.
This responsible factor specifically did not say what the target was, but said it was at least one.
Associated Press says the target was rockets SA-125 of Russian production.
At least twice this year, Israel carried out an air raid on shipments of missiles in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
For example, commentator Pečina spoke so that he could agree, where the president of Štěch was breathing a mess.
Hajtman Chovanec was my suspect as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
The President of Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of the misery of ČSSD.
The other gentlemen showed their weaknesses in particular.
Senator Dienstbier is essential and readable and unusable, Vice-President Zárálek was the most unable to talk on TV.
On this basis, I see no better chance than for the CzechSSD to propose to the Vice-President of the Senate of Gajdoškow, the only one would not have an initial handicap and I think it would have performed a standard performance.
It's such a good solution that someone in charge can barely support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was going on and continue without breaking the side.
Alena Gajdóšková could draw together a minority government with only a blessing from President Babiš and without human beings, but with the Human Health Minister Speechka, who is actually a believing social democrat.
This minority government would have great stability because it would have put in place a proper referendum law and would have committed itself to supporting President Okamura.
President Babiš would eventually accept tax progress because he is smart and he will see that it is not possible without it.
People wouldn't bring any trouble, because the Talker is the bearer of the best they have, and they wouldn't be in the government otherwise.
The same applies to YES, and a valuable minister would be found here, but if they wisely do not want to enter into risky government participation but will provide support, they too will be well.
Let's take the courage of Alena Gajdoshka!
Foreign visa-authorised workers may undergo a “authority” test
With the government’s intention to extend police procedures, it considers the “authority” test for foreign officials with a visa authorisation of 457.
The test, if accepted, will be applied by means of criteria in order to prevent programme 457 being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for moving family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was published today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew sentenced the government rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it might offend Australian neighbours.
“The declaration ‘foreigners at the end of the front’ and ‘work first for Australia’ is a very unpleasant remnant of the time when unions required a protected labour market,” she said to the Australian-Indian Institute today.
Historically, it meant protecting the white labour force – and I would not be surprised if anyone in this region recorded the echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion discusses 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where she treats officials for smuggling, implemented five of the recommended changes and the others remain to be taken into consideration.
Where the ‘authority’ criteria are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘they are entitled to nominations in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal relationship with the owner or the relevant person of the sponsor’.
Following previous experience with enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of employees but then employed hundreds of them, companies may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka, who sought asylum, died with suspicion of a heart attack after arriving on an asylum ship on Christmas Island this week.
A nine - year - old son traveled with him to Australia and was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on a boat after his father’s death on Wednesday.
The Australian authorities and the man rushed to the hospital on Christmas Island where he died.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the advantages of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2’s work indicates that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will commence as soon as the first phase of 2026 begins.
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, said the project "will bring Britain together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he had been "excited" with the British government on this plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
Upon completion of the Phase, two will lead a line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which conducted interviews with the national transport agency Transport Scotland, entrusted HS2 with finding out additional railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three or less hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that will better connect Britain and its city. ”
We gave SH2 green because the benefits that it brings are huge.
Without that, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
However, it is also a link – 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected thanks to HS2 across the UK.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland. ”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown, Mr. Carmichael, called for the "certainly" support of the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed track has the potential to bring unmeasured economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland in the overall case of high-speed railway across Britain. ”
So we are excited to work with the British government to explore the possibility of bringing high-speed railways to Scotland, bringing benefits to all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh link, which the Scottish government is planning as it is.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study, together with the British Ministers next year and the joint decision on further steps.
Together with Bartou arrested inspection and analysis of anti-corruption police
Information on arrests Víta Barty began to spread on Thursday night, when the message was delivered by the First Report server.cz.
The MF DNES, meanwhile, found out that the case was taken over by the General Inspectorate of Security (GIBS), its people were to arrest Barta in the centre of Prague.
It happened outside the Four Seasons Hotel.
Inspections address cases where they are among the accused police officers, but its authority also applies to civilians.
According to the MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police is among the arrested - the head of analysts and informatics Jan Petržílek.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
However, the speaking anti-corruption police, Jaroslav Ibehej, refused to comment on the information, saying that the media must turn to Gibbs in this matter.
Even its spokesman for the inspection of Radka Sandor did not want to say anything about the case, she turned to the City State Department in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," said the spokesman for the representative of Štěpánka Zenklová.
Also from this non-specific reaction, it can be argued that the event has taken place, but it is in a mode of secrecy that the speaker does not allow to say anything specific.
In a similar situation is Bart's lawyer Oldrich Poor.
The media said that Bart is representing "and in this matter", but since it is classified information, Bart's arrest cannot confirm or deny.
First, some media speculated that Bart's arrest might be related to former police President Peter Lessy.
This was put in place by Bart, together with former VV President Radek John, who was head of the interior ministry.
The dispute, which was caused by the outbreak of Peter Ne Time and the VV even had to deal with President Václav Klaus at the time.
I don't know where this connection to my person is coming from.
No one contacted me, I wasn't interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about things," said IDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
He was officially named by Radek John, the real head of the party, but he was Bart at the time.
Barta has now run for elections for the Movement of Świat, the parliamentary mandate has only escaped him closely - by 175 votes.
Christmas leader Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what this was all about.
"The greeting of Bart was one of many candidates of many parties to our candidate and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Christmas of direct democracy, Tomia Okamura," he distanced himself from Barta Okamura, who before the elections said that he had given Bart space to run for Christmas because he helped solve the problem of executioners.
Vít Bart took place in court in 2012 with his former co-partner from VV Jaroslav Škarko.
Rules on the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft shall remain in force in Australia for the time being
Passengers from Australian airlines will still have to switch off their tablets and smartphones during launch and landing, regardless of changes in the US to ease the regulations on these devices.
The US Federal Air Administration (FAA) has given US companies space to change their procedures, so passengers will be able to read electronic books on their devices, watch videos or play games during critical phases of the flight if the equipment remains in the “aircraft” regime.
Travelers can already do this during the vast part of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot have access to their electronic books during the start and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a great deal of work from American carriers to meet the requirements, but indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said that it had examined this notification, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of flight were still in force in Australia.
‘The CASA currently does not have any specific rules governing the use of electronic equipment on an aircraft,’ he said.
This issue is covered by the rules which require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout the period and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, who has already talked to Casa about expanding the use of its on-board entertainment system wi-fi, has been favoured, but has announced that it will submit its decision to the regulatory authority.
"We would welcome an analysis by the CASA of the permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have (wireless on-board fun) would improve customer experience," the speaker said.
Qantas announced that he would stick to current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic equipment must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change it soon," he said.
The FAA rules apply to American airlines.
But we are constantly concerned about developments in the regulatory area that may be useful for our passengers, and we are certainly studying the FAA decisions and the reasons behind them.
In the case of US air carriers, the impact of the regulations will be different from that of the company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their planes can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, as well as revise manuals, training materials, manual luggage programmes and information for passengers.
“As soon as the airline confirms its fleet tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable and light electronic equipment such as tablets, electronic readings and smart phones, at any altitude”, said FAA.
In rare cases, the low visibility of the crew shall instruct passengers to shut down the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that the heavier equipment be safely placed under the seats or in the storage space above the head during take-off and descent.
With growing poverty in the middle class, pawnshops in Singapore are flourishing
At the Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga's gold bracelet, ring and earrings are stopped so that she can pay for her daughter's school fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money on it,” says Mrs Amirthalinga.
Although each month she receives $2,400 as an administrator ($3,000 SGD) and her husband also works, the family monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is indeed such that ValueMax, where a woman performs her transaction, became the third pawnbroker in Singapore this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
The pawnshops in Singapore normally apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, the pawnshops have the advantage of not requiring the verification of a person (payment history) or a receipt document and may provide a loan faster than the banks.
Thus, as families feel pressure from the rising cost of living and the growing debt of households and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by a relaxed monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to pawnshops to deal with deteriorating financial situations.
This week, Standard & Poor's credit rating agency quoted the increasing use of household credit primarily as an increasing risk factor for Asian banks’ creditworthiness.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt in Asia in view of the gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the head of a ladder with a proportion of 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
The economists also feared the high levels of consumption debt in Thailand, which just came out of the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and weakening consumer demand.
"It is reasonable that with rising costs people will try to supplement their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at the Malaysian CIMB Bank.
Historically, the high prices of gold over the past two years have contributed to the fact that people are succinctly stopping their personal property and taking advantage of the opportunity to change the cash of their family jewelry.
About 70 percent of the items in 200 city pawnshops are made up of gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we stop grandma's gold necklace and we get it back next month.
The largest operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, recorded an increase of up to 20 per cent in the number of customers using its pawnshop in recent months.
Growth in the pawnshop sector is so great that ValueMax, a branch operator in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says Executive Director ValueMax Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60 percent of the $66 million SGD it won this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discounted creditors are under fire of criticism over high interest rates, Mrs. Yeah says that the flag offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but it also does not directly increase the debt.
“The customers stop items they already own, and the cashing of personal property does not increase household debt,” he says.
In the company, the mortgage is increasingly accepted as a means of ensuring short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, those who use pawnshops are not just people in financial distress.
Rich people from Singapore also use the ValueMax branch when stopping gold bars or Rolex watch, and they can reach up to 60 percent of the cash purchase price.
Our customers are of all possible proportions.
"There are wealthy individuals who need to borrow short-term because of their courageous trades or investments, or small businesses who need help in solving problems in their money flow," says Mrs. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as possible.
Rescue package worth $325 million for Tasmanian health care
The federal government insists that a bailout worth $325 million for shrinking health care in Tasmania would contain tough conditions to ensure that the government will not lose its funding.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Pliberseková announced that the Australian Union is making “swift measures” to reverse the crisis caused by an aging island population, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Financing for four years has been decided following government consultations with independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilk.
"The government has come with an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve the specific problems it faces," Mrs Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for surgery at the request of the patient.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic operations and grey background operations, will help to remove indebtedness.
Money is also available at freely available clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical records in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the thoughts of the leading clinician doctors that they will best help the Tasmanian health care system," said Mrs Plibersek.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian Government must require strict reporting and registration obligations.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding to receive the money of the Australian Union, and inform each month about where additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State delivers services as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would be useless, “until real reform is followed in order to provide a more sustainable basis for the Tasmanian public health system”.
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for its response to its request for speedy assistance, which he had first received in the negotiations with the Prime Minister in early May.
"I believe that a federal aid package can relieve public health from a critical state," said Mr Wilkie.
According to the Government, these additional procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
The Federal Health Opposition, Peter Dutton, believes that today's statement is just a “offspring”.
"The reason why I am here is that the Labour Government has taken $430 million out of our health system," the ABC TV said.
You can't have a government that takes nearly half a billion dollars, and an Australian union that is committed to $300 million, and pretend to be good news.
Mr Dutton called on Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicholux has adapted Denise Diderot's novel, which brings remarkable film expeditions and seasons, but is also more boring than it should be.
It unfolds in the 1960s in France and tells a grim story about Suzanne, a young noble woman who is sent to a monastery by her family.
When he rebels, he suffers extreme cruelty from a criminally perverted mother introduced, and for another he becomes the object of sexual passion.
The film never goes down to smugness or sensation, and that's his problem.
The ceremonial aspect of this story is that even viewers will experience the torment of wearing a worn shirt similar to that of a woman.
Skiareals want to cut down on families with children
Syria destroyed its means of producing chemical weapons, says the supervisory authority
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with toxic gas, the Committee on Global Control of Chemical Weapons said on Thursday, while severe conflicts occurred in the north of the country, near one of the places where toxic substances were supposed to be stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also declared that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war.
The announcement of the Chemical Weapons Ban Organisation came the day before 1 November,
the date on which this organisation established in The Hague to destroy or disable the operation of all chemical weapons and mechanical equipment for mixing chemicals for the purpose of creating toxic gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this in principle of the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to launch the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including aperite and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came on Thursday when the fights in the city of Safira, which experts refer to as the headquarters of the chemical weapons and storage plant, stated the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights with its seat in Britain.
A group of activists who monitored the total number of victims through a network of activists in Syria announced on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
This should include 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, there are 29,954 members of the armed forces of Bashar Assad, 18,678.
There are also 2,202 government fugitives and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN organisation estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since.
The conflict has forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Asada's troops fought in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have been associated with Al-Qaeda for weeks.
The observer on Thursday stated that the losses were on both sides but did not have specific numbers.
The battles have highlighted the danger facing chemical weapons inspectors who, during their mission, have in the midst of the continuing civil war in Syria to rid themselves of the chemical arsenal, have to deal with the tight deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW office, which is working closely with the UN, said that his team is now “satisfied that he has verified – and monitored the destruction – of Syrian declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling.”
He added that “no other control activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed their first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 places declared Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit two places because of security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that these two places were “left and ... items of the chemical weapons programme contained were moved to two other declared places which were checked”.
It was not immediately clear whether the device in Safire was one of the places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed on a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I bow to the courage and courage you have shown in fulfilling this most demanding mission that this organization has ever had,” said observer director Ahmet Uzumc in his commentary issued by OPCW.
Now, in its third year, the Sunni Muslim rebels and the Asad government stand against each other in civil war, with their security forces, which are full of members of the Alavits sect, and the Shiite Islam.
Regarding further developments, the head of Observer Ramí Abdul Rahman said that there was a strong explosion in the interior of an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lazizia on Wednesday.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over judgment over the founder of the Bali bombing
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the Bali bombing in 2002 responded indignantly to the judgment handed down by the last of the founders who were built before justice, and said that Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for constructing the explosive device used in the bombing attack.
In 15 years, he could be paroled.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder during an attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty in several other counts related to terrorism, including a series of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution claimed life, although it might have insisted that a man named "Demolition man" (the fighter) be sentenced to death because of his reputation as an expert in the production of explosives.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who lost her 39 - year - old twins, Jane and Jenny, in a destructive attack by Patek and other founders nearly ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek was to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow up on the others.
For the AAP agency, Mrs Corteen said, "It should be built in front of the executioner's company."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I don't see any more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sara Club was compared to the country when a heavy charge placed outside a parked van was launched shortly after 23 o’clock on October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber fired a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while kept alive, three times he “dead ” doctors.
Mr Hughes said that Patek should face the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jamá Islamia responsible for the massacre – Amrosi, Muchlas and Imam Samudru – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one else.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive, he just isn't.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others isn't that bad.
Patek was facing trial as the last of Bali's assassins.
The arrest was avoided for nearly ten years, but in January 2011, he was eventually captured in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later American forces killed former leader Al-Qaeda Osama bin Ladina.
During the trial, an FBI agent in his testimony announced that reports from intelligence services had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to reconnect between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He did not volunteer," said Mrs Corteen.
So far, he has not felt sorry for the grief he caused others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"This year we will see a lot of tears," said Mrs Corteen.
The duck can still appeal against the verdict.
FAA: Air traffic passengers can now use technological exploits on aircraft (but they must not call from their mobile phones)
Passengers from airlines will be able to use their electronic equipment “from the gate to the gate” – in addition to calling from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music on the basis of impatiently expected new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
Travelers do not expect changes to take place immediately.
As soon as the change is introduced according to individual airlines, FAA manager Michael Huerta said at the press conference.
Flight companies will have to demonstrate to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated training manuals for the crew and the plant management directive in order to comply with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment on aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"Despite the status of such a plan, we can improve the extended use of electronic equipment very quickly," said the FAA in its statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain issues a permit.
Passengers are expected to turn their equipment off again when the plane falls to land, and they do not shut them down until the plane is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and travel, according to FAA.
From most of the new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified to enable passengers to use Wifi at higher altitudes, these criteria are expected to be met.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
"As soon as the new rules are put in place safely – and we will work closely with transport companies – it will be a success," Glading said in her statement.
To be honest, we are tired of looking like “watchmen. ”
However, surfing on the Internet, e-mailing and texting or data downloading will continue to be below 3 kilometres above sea level, the Agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to the air regime.
So still no Words with Friends, an online game of Scrabble type played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011, when, as is well known, he was thrown off American Airlines' plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And harder devices like laptops will have to be kept in place because of the fear that they might hurt someone if they flew around the cabin.
Mobile phone calls will continue to be prohibited on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not set by the FAA, but by the American Federal Committee for Telecommunications.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic equipment during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Transport Safety Committee, national safety expert at CBS News, said that mobile phones continue to be considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigational devices, but we also know from FCC data that can cause interference in the air," Rosenker said.
In order to explore this problem, the FAA Advisory Committee proposed last month that the government allow for wider use of electronic equipment.
In recent years, pressure has been exerted on the FAA to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a democracy from Missouri, claim that there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is widespread.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the obligation to shut down their devices.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to the disruption of navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radio with them, technical mining of the time.
New airlines are much more affected by electrical systems than previous-generation aircraft, but are also designed and approved by FAA management to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have been offering Wi-Fi to passengers in altitudes.
Plans designed for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The large majority of airlines should adapt to the new rules for greater use of electronic equipment, Huertová said.
Modern electronic equipment generally radiates much less intense radio transmission than it did in previous generations.
For example, e-readers only issue minimal broadcasting when turning the page.
But broadcasting is stronger when devices download or transmit data.
Among those who press to release restrictions for the use of these devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded the aircraft with their e-readers Kindle and carried out the test flight, but no problem emerged.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passenger Association said he was convinced that the disruption from these devices was real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee have declared that there are only incurable reports from pilots to support the fact that such equipment can cause disruption of aviation systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA pilots allow passengers to shut down equipment during flight by devices for low visibility.
The Group welcomed these changes and, according to it, it is a reasonable procedure for travellers to use technology to a large extent.
"We are pleased that the FAA acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with safety," said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was flown from a drilling platform in the North Sea and released back to nature
The bird was transported to the coast after it was found exhausted on the oil rig in the Black Sea, and released back into the free nature.
One crane was transferred by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being treated by the Scottish company SPCA at the rescue centre until he recovered.
The operating center of Colin Seddon said: “It is likely that the graham was migrated from northern Europe when a strong wind over the North Sea caught it. ”
Apparently, he ran out of power and found refuge on the oil rig.
Mr Seddon added: “He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us with a request for help. ”
He was in good condition and health at the time the hen was released.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to connect businesses and define what changes in relation to the EU would like to see British entrepreneurs and job-generating companies.
To this end, we have set up the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we asked the leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov was asked about 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing British enterprises of various sizes and from various sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be surprising.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on the countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states are withdrawing.
They want to see how the government favours new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than hindering the long and strenuous process of reforming the mysterious European institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific political areas – from monopolistic regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European business area – as much as 40 per cent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European companies, expressed their consent.
Finally, our research by managers revealed the most eloquent knowledge, and that a clear majority wants Britain to seek a change of contract and a relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings identified by enterprises of different sizes and the main business group show that the business sector is pushing for a “significant change” that will have an impact back on Britain.
There is a lot at stake – achieving a change in the contract and a better agreement for Britain can mean up to 16% in voting in the EU referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that the British trade supports his plan to amend the conditions of British EU membership.
It also shows that the business sector expects this innovation to represent a significant shift from the current weighting of forces back to Britain.
A better deal for Britain is possible, and given how the euro area travels for a narrower economic and fiscal union, even more so.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and as the results of our survey show, for business this means a refocus on trade and a major change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.
John Kerry confessed: spying has gone too far!
The United States went on spying sometimes "too far", admitting, according to AFP, the head of American diplomacy John Kerry during a video conference between Washington and London.
However, according to the minister, he was used to counter terrorist attacks.
According to AFP, "The first confession from Washington" sounded in the middle of a sharp controversy on both Atlantic coasts due to a scandalous discovery of mass data tracking by the US National Security Agency (NSA), whose target was also American allies.
"In some cases, I admit, just as the President (Barack Obama) did, some of these actions have gone too far and we assure it will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
But above all, he was defending his previous practice.
According to him, information collection is necessary to combat terrorism and prevent assassinations, such as attacks from September 11, 2001 in the US, attacks in Madrid in March 2004 or in London in July 2005.
"We prevented aircraft from falling, buildings from exploding, and people were killed because we were able to be informed of the plots in time," Kerry stressed.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "has in some cases gone disproportionately far".
An affair surrounding American intelligence, which reportedly monitored hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turns out that the Americans also tracked German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone.
European leaders did not hide resentment and some called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that warrants or significantly restricts monitoring.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says the pipeline in Bulgaria is opening a new gas era
The launch of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said the director of Gazprom.
"Today we are witnesses of the border: the construction on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contract dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that a direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "always" removed.
Once the entire project starts operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream gas pipeline at a cheap price.
Gazprom says that the construction is scheduled to start in other countries at the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
They have a decisive battle ahead of them.
The Lebanese movement Hizbollah deployed 15,000 fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle over the mountainous region of Kalamun.
According to the ever-defining reports, Israel destroyed rockets designed for Hizbollah during the mid-term raids in two places in Western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of that army.
Its programme is also the fight against Israel, which does not interfere with the Syrian conflict, but has made it clear that it will prevent the movement of arms to Hizbollah's hands in Lebanon.
Reports of central Israeli raids on weapons warehouses in Western Syria are yet to be clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but it was confirmed by American sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com hit missiles fired from the Mediterranean area of the Syrian rocket base Snúbar Jabal south of Latákije.
The Al-Arabia reporting station claims that two warehouses were hit in which missiles were ready to transport to Lebanon.
According to her sources, it was rockets from the Russian production of SA-8.
Israel's report refused to comment, but military analyst Ron ben Jishaj said that Syria is constantly trying to supply Hizballah with missiles and the Syrian Air Force is teaching members of the Hizballah Armed Section to handle missiles.
SA-8 are obsolete missiles that have had the Syrian army since the 1980s.
They're located on a moving chassis.
Although they are relatively primitive, mobility and small dimensions make it easy to hide.
They're equipped with a radar that turns off after the shooting, so it's hard to focus them.
Latakia lies in Western Syria, in the area inhabited by ruling alavita.
It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has been involved in the fighting in Western Syria in the past.
He claims to be helping to protect the Syrian Shia community, which the alavites belong to.
It is now estimated that 15,000 of his warriors are ready to help the army recover Kalamun.
With Hizbollah there, the Syrian army is also strengthening its troops.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city of Homs.
According to the source of al-Arabiyah, the battle is to be a defense against the recent attack by the opposition on the Syrian Shiite Brigade command of Abu Fadla Abbas in the Shia region of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army fight back this year at the Lebanese border.
Many insurgents from Kusajru have just left for Kalamun.
Recently, it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic wished for early elections.
Corruption, the dumping of money for over-purchase and public procurement, tax hikes and, last but not least, government scandals were cited as reasons.
According to the results of the elections, it can be concluded that most citizens have complied with this situation.
That they did not mind, and they were actually satisfied with the state that was here (the theft and debt of this state).
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3,413,497 voters failed to vote, 596,357 electors elected TOP 09,384,174 voters in total, 4,394,028 in fact supported the original government coalition, representing 52.16% of all eligible voters.
Which is an over-half majority.
When I add 1,016,829 ČSSD voters to the above parties, then the old order (because all of the above parties were involved in "the theft" and debt of this state), 64.23% of eligible voters actually agreed with this state.
In fact, the majority of the voters have indicated that they are not for the punishment of the perpetrators of the theft and reprisals of this state.
Or do you think that the members of the ČSSD who took part in this would be bound by appropriate laws?
Is he even gonna help us?

The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men’s Association (YMCA) were charged before the charges against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Commission for the Sexual Abuse of Children learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men’s Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of sexual abuse of children before charges were brought against child counselor Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011.
But before the commission heard that in their initial statement to the Commission, this association had stated that they had never dealt with a child’s sexual abuse in their organization.
The Executive Director of Phillip Hare was asked when one of the employees of YMCA was accused of child pornography offences, and another where a gymnast in Caringbah from YMCA was convicted in 1991 for sexual harassment of children who had taken care of him.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, the board's counsellor, that he knew about the first case, but not the second.
He admitted that the YMCA’s initial statement was also inaccurate when it stated that YMCA carried out external audits that assessed this organisation as the leading advocate of children’s rights.
The evidence submitted by the Commission shows that YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest of four possible evaluations in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working with YMCA when he was 21 years old, admitted that the leadership from him himself failed when Mr. Lord accepted, without making sure that the staff was aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted of sexual harassment by 12 boys who were committed in two years when he worked at YMCA.
He's been trapped for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, rejected the claim that YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented personnel from reporting child safety violations to Mr. Lord.
The members of the staff gave evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including the fact that the Lord was alone with the children, kept them private, kept them sitting on his lap, telling them that he liked them, and kept them playing with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, who served as head of the YMCA Children's Association in Caringbach, who was Lord's supervisor, was “very frightening and often difficult to talk about”.
The Director-General said he did not accept evidence from the staff that they felt they did not know if they should contact their superiors and report their actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord had darkened their judgment, so they did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said that the YMCA Council in New South Wales had expressed its view that the lesson in “Jonathan Lord’s case” for the organization was that the staff “did not submit any report” and the advice agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have the staff sign agreements to remain silent shortly after the charges were brought forward was made by General Manager for Child Services in the organisation of YMCA Liam Whitley.
He said that the goal was to avoid disturbing evidence, but it was “overly passionate ” and misproceeded.
Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the Commission that YMCA was not safe in New South Wales between 2009 and 2011.
He said that there were serious problems in recruitment, checking, processing, training, and management of staff.
The hearing was adjourned on 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take advantage of the opportunity to return to the post of Prime Minister, but admitted that the return is unlikely.
On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, after 10 years of leadership, Mr Blair has largely avoided talks about British politics and has limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador of the Middle East Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, the response of the London Evening Standard newspaper was as follows: "Yes, of course, but it will be difficult to do so, so..."
While in Cardiff, teams of horse show experts were gathering to fight for the Horse of the Year, it was clear to all that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was prepared for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although they do not yet go to school and only a few months ago did he make the first steps, this boy and his pet, Shetland pony Toffee, gently cut three laps to finally win the prize and leave behind 30 dragging adult rivals.
This inseparable pair – with the same height – was praised for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition run by the Sunnybank riding centre in the village of Rudry near Cardiff.
He stood up against the gentlemen and the ladies in the elegant hats, rolled his beret to a cheerful angle and let his two-year-old Toffee parade around the circle.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural ability to control horses far superior to his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for appearance and personality.
Fenton Toffee got his third birthday in March, and since then, he's been practicing with this Shetland pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee work very well together. ”
They didn't have much hope, but eventually they left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was the second time he and Toffe competed, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal, and completely strangers wanted to take pictures with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales is following up his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Says Mrs. Howells: “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone encouraged and applauded. ”
He ran across the sand all over the arena, and although he acted so smallly, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and farm and got two chickens in charge.
Given how he started, he'll be back at the Horse of the Year competition soon, and I'm sure he'll be fine.
The speaker’s annual horse show competition said: “The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control the pony. ”
They make a great team together.
The jurors picked Fenton and Toffee up for their excellent speech and the way they showed up on the competition circuit.
They always watch how good teamwork is between the pony and the one who leads it – and Fenton and Toffe were the best.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his lovely clothes, he really fell in there with him.
Too many curious newspapers are to be examined
The Chinese newspaper, which on the front page requested the release of a reporter accused of conspiracy, will be thoroughly investigated, the press administrator said.
The New Express newspaper, based in Guangzhou, made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes to invent stories about a society partly owned by the state.
The administrator said that the New Express newspaper would now carry out “full repairs”.
The regulation of "repair" came from the State Press and Publications Office, Radio, Film and TV in Kuang-tung Province.
Preliminary investigations have shown that between September 2012 and August 2013 the New Express of the Yangtze group Evening News issued some false reports about that company, Zoomlion.
"The editor's management of the New Express newspaper has been unorganized," the administrator said in his statement.
He said he had to decide "to lay down Chen Yongzhou's administrative sentence in the form of abolishing the journalist's license".
He also “ordered the Yangchen Group Evening News to carry out the overall correction of the New Express and recommended that they examine the responsible persons in New Express and immediately change the management of the New Express. ”
Mr. Chen wrote for New Express several articles dealing with financial irregularities in a company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, his newspaper issued two requests for his release on the front page and claimed to be behind his newspaper work.
But then Mr. Chen showed up on state television and admitted that he had made false stories for payment.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and also to the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence," CCTV said at the state intelligence station.
I did it mainly because I asked for money and fame.
I realize I've acted badly.
After Mr. Chen's apology, he issued a letter from New Express on the cover of an apology stating that he failed when he failed to check his reports sufficiently.
Recently, several closely monitored suspects have made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still regularly enforced, irrespective of the amendment of this year's law, which prohibits the authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
A tunnel was found to smuggle drugs between the United States and Mexico with its own railroad
One of the most clever tunnels for drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico, supplemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railway.
The U.S. authorities described a tunnel of roughly one meter times as one of the most ingenious secret passages ever discovered.
The tunnel, which clicks into the length of nearly six football courses, connects the warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the USA.
This area is filled with unspecified warehouses, where it is easy to hide trucks before they are loaded with drugs.
The authorities said that the tunnel was closed before drugs could have been undetected.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also detained eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of holding marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute it.
In the event of conviction, he faces imprisonment from 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers enter vast drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after a harvest of marijuana in central Mexico, which poses a problem to drug cartels as soon as possible to get their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a corridor about 650 metres long equipped with railways, which led from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economics and the Centre connect management.
For example, they will offer joint tenders
New integrated newsroom of Economia in Prague Karlín.
Economia took another step to transform the Centre holding house into its media house.
Since Friday, Economia and the Centre have shared top management.
"The integration of the organisational structure and the staff union are essential for the integration of both publishing facilities into the joint media house," comments the Vice-President of the Economy and Commissioner-General Kamil Čermák.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Centre Holdings Andreas Demuth, who will lead the single management, will be complemented by the Chief Executive Officer of the Centre Holdings.
The new Joint Director of Trade was appointed Pavel Voparil, under whom both Zuzana Tylčerová, an adjective director, is also subordinate.
Stephen Burd became the new head of information technology.
Vladimír Piskaček is co-director of the newsroom, whose team is also the director of the transformation of Jakub Unger.
Adele Pitts was appointed the new director of marketing.
The separate branch of corporate communication is newly managed by Vera Lhotská.
The joint financial director is Karel Žadud, the management of human resources for both publishing companies is led by Petr Slabá.
"The new organisational structure will, among other things, enable us to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, better connect the content of all titles issued and, last but not least, further significantly improve the business management of the company," Čermák added.
The company Economia, owned by the financier Zdeněk Bakala, entered into a buy-in agreement with Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings is created by servers Aktuálno.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB Agency Najijo or portfolio of other almost two dozen smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Economic Newspapers, IHNED.cz reporting server, Respekt and Econom weeklys, and the number of printed and online B2B titles.
The most successful in selling digital versions of its major titles in the long term among Czech publishers.
This year, in June, the publishing industry moved to a newly built modern space in Prague's Karlina.
CME will target the TV business.
They're gonna let almost a quarter of us go.
The CME media group will release.
By the end of the year, he wants to cut a thousand people.
He's going to cut down all the side activities and focus on his main business, television broadcasts.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of about 4,500 people.
That's how almost a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of CME is CET 21, which holds the license for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and Czech version of MTV.
How much savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the local TV TV company TV Nova, it is not clear yet.
"It's premature and we really can't comment," said New Josef Koukolíček, director of communication.
According to the MF DNES, the significant release of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but it should have the greatest impact on the personnel situation of the CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both Novy Christoph Mainisch and Michael Del Nin, who followed long-standing director Adrian Sarbu, spoke during a mid-term conference with analysts about wanting to limit all activities that are not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce in particular the cost of producing its own shows, filmmaking and production activities.
In the industrial area of the Czech Republic in Prague, a cool tower burned down at night
In the industrial area of the Czech Republic in Prague there was a large capacity storage facility, according to firefighters, probably a cooling tower.
"At the fire fire fire the firemen left on Thursday before 11 p.m. this morning, the fire was still coming," Pavlín Adamc, spokesman for the Prague firemen, announced.
The amount of damage in the air in the vicinity according to the measurement did not exceed the allowed limits.
The damage and causes of the fire are unknown yet.
About five dozen firefighters made it to the area in Kolben Street.
"This is a fire of a large capacity storage tower, probably a cooling tower," Adamc said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we are using the transport line from tanks," she added.
According to the T.cz server, the shutdown was complicated by a malfunctioning hydrant network, so firefighters had to transport the water from a different location.
The firefighters' strike commander has declared a second degree of fire alarm.
There are four of them, in the most serious situations the fourth is declared.
They also went to the site to check the amount of dangerous substances that could have been in the air during the fire.
"But they did not find in the air the amount of damage that would exceed hygienic standards," said the fireman.
British police have provided Assange with a release notice.
Today the British police delivered a notice of the release of WikiLeaks to Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he requested asylum.
Scotland Yard declared that 40 - year - old Australians had delivered “a notice of release” by asking him to come to the police station and that if he did not do so, he could be threatened by arrest.
Assange, under British law, has exhausted his options when the Supreme Court annulled his appeal against extradition this month, thus facing extradition to Sweden for sexual crimes.
Because he feared that Stockholm would release him to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June, where he requested asylum from this South American country.
Scotland Yard “deployed a notice of release to a 40-year-old man asking to come to the police station on the day and hour they were assigned to him”, the speaker said.
Assange continues to violate the terms of the bail.
The Embassy refused to submit notices of release to comment.
Assange is afraid that he will be issued from Sweden to the United States, where he can face espionage charges because he published 250,000 American diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The driver got a fine of £1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
The motorist received a fine of 1,000 pounds for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) of Tiptree, Essex, was seen in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, she found out she had a drink between her thighs.
At Colchester Howe's police court, he confessed to the charges of driving recklessly and carelessly.
Seven points arrived at his account, resulting in a six-month ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay the costs of £90 and the premium for the accused £100.
As a result of taxes on owners of foreign properties, the Prague London bubble
The Ministry of Finance has pre-numbered the income tax on financial assets, but is awaiting the final decision of Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 budget presented a 7 % charge for the transfer of properties for buildings in the price of over 2 million pounds and annual charges for buyers who own property within the company, not as individuals.
The income from the transfer fee in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea housing fund, which reached 708 million pounds in the 2012 tax year, is already exceeding the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: “In view of the increase in the transfer of property to high value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that property of high value is undertaxed regardless of the effect of the outdated tax system of the head.”
He added that “this step could have caused some foreign investors to shy away from buying real estate in London, or perhaps the existing owners are reluctant to sell. ”
The leading properties – up to 5 % to 10 % of the housing market at price – in the rich band from Fulham to Wimbledon recorded an increase of 11,8 % in last year.
Prices in the centre of London continue to show a steady increase of 5,6 % year-on-year, but were shaded by the flourishing “home market” where, according to the survey, Savills’ real estate offices experienced Southwest, North (7,4 %) and East (6,5 %) of the increase.
Scientists have more light on how tail movements relate to the mood of the dog
Early research showed that happy dogs spin their tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs have their tail mostly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can detect and respond to these fine differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at Trent University, said: “People are well known that the left and right sides of the brain have a different connection to incentives that arouse positive or negative emotions. ”
The same thing we tried to do in other species.
He added that, as with humans, even with dogs, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In order to obtain further information on how dogs react to disproportionate tail spins of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that watched films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Apparently, it won't take long to figure out why their tail goes one way or the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown dogs films about dogs — whether in a natural version or in the form of silhouettes — to get rid of any maturing impulses, and we have also been able to adjust the movement of the tail and to show it more to the right or to the left.”
When the animals saw a non-express dog moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of a dog spinning its tail), she remained perfectly calm.
But when she recorded the filming of her tail mostly to the left (new from the point of view of a dog spinning its tail), their heart rate increased and the animals acted uncertainly.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think that dogs would communicate knowingly through these movements.
Rather, it is believed that dogs have learned from experience which movements they must and which they do not have to pay attention to.
He said: “If you meet dogs and move their tails in one direction several times, it is more likely that friendly behavior and movement of transport results in less friendly behavior, you will react on the basis of this experience. ”
Researchers say that findings can help dogs, vets, and trainers to understand their animals’ emotions better.
A specialist in dog behavior, John Bradshaw, a university teacher at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right sides are important for dogs.
Last year a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they watch an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a cheerful dog.
And in another professional treatise from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “Dogs were more likely to be seen with dogs when they were turning their tail to the left than on the right, when they were more uncertain – rather than the Italian study. ”
The difference can be attributed to him by the fact that dogs in these different animal studies in movies or dog robots did not exactly interpret themselves as dogs.
He explained that she could help study how dogs react to real dogs.
“Although there is bad evidence for many mammals that both sides of the brain are used for various purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how simple it is to record their behavior, it may not take long to understand why their tails sometimes go one way and the other.
Arctic Monkeys Moved Concert to Glasgow for Alex Turner's Disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock band moved the concert to Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with throat inflammation.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to leave the Hydro City complex on Friday.
The disease of the lead singer Alex Turner, however, forced her to move the performance.
The group's announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone the Thursday performance in the LG arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, the Arctic Monkeys group says: “After deciding to postpone today’s performance in the LG arena in Birmingham and on the basis of a medical recommendation, the Arctic Monkeys group must also postpone the performance in the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday 1 November.”
"Alex Turner was diagnosed with larynx inflammation, and unfortunately he won't be able to get out."
In the LG arena in Birmingham this will take place on 20 November and in the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets for these performances shall remain valid.
We would like to apologize to everyone who bought the tickets for the inconvenience that caused them.
If you need more information, please contact your customer service at the box office where you bought your tickets.
Pope František appoints the first cardinal in February
On Thursday, the Vatican announced that Pope Francis appointed the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
The cardinals in the clergy of the Catholic Church have the highest position immediately after the pope and are the ones who elect the popes, so František will establish his first group of men who will eventually help to elect his successor.
Now it's 201 cardinals.
As soon as the cardinal reaches 80 years of age, however, he cannot participate in the election of the pope – the group is thus reduced to 120 elected cardinals.
In a statement declaring this report, Peter Federico Lombardi, spokesman for the Vatican, said that before the festivities of the new cardinals there would be a meeting of the current cardinals known as the Consistorium.
"The Pope František has decided to announce his decision to convene a February consortium in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that the number of electorate cardinals is likely to drop by February.
He said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes to raise the number of voters to 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wants.
The consortium will be important next year because it will be the first after František was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there are certain orientations on Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but only have a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since František established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have been tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope has made his own decisions.
"Now František has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that it is “probably possible” that these cardinals would be asked by the pope for advice.
But in this situation we were not before – it is a novelty.
Valero said that the popes have traditionally elevated the cardinals of the bishops from large places, but František is “full of surprise – so we don’t know who he calls”.
GM Downloads Some New Light Trucks in the USA for Repairing Seat Backing
According to Friday's announcement from the US Car Safety Authority, General Motors is downloading almost 19,000 of his new (2014) light trucks Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra to correct the manual loading malfunction.
For some of these vehicles, the mechanism of loading the front seats may be faulty.
As a result, seatbacks do not comply with federal car safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the website of the National Road Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that “if the vehicle gets hit from behind, the driver’s head support does not have to adequately protect the passenger, which increases the risk of injury”.
The withdrawn models were made between August 1 and September 10th.
GM introduced a supply on the market in June, and for this leading American car it is the most important to market the vehicle from restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the supplier of the malfunction in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the announcement to owners due to the 16-day government failure, which weakened car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were processed for the 2014 models, rose by about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year to GM on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 models of Silverado and 16,503 models of Sierra.
Stocks on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
The desperate cry of Obama's electorate
I voted for Obama twice – I shared the hope of a possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts have lost the obstruction of the Republican Party.
Obstructive policy cannot excuse the passion of Obama’s health care website or drone attacks
The 2008 Obama campaign's memoirs are a sad reminder of what might have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year medical student at Harvard.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought about this book that during the dark days of my second year at the medical school, it would encourage me and restore me to a speck of hope.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and it is a memory of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When I finish my patients' reviews tonight, and I go to bed, the book brings me back to when politics inspired millions of people, and they're going to take your breath away.
The elections ended with an overwhelming advantage, and television coverage forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents hid newspapers they had found.
A young team of visionaries headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for a change.
During his appointment to the office in 2008, Obama had 82 per cent support.
And this is where I close the book.
To go into the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It is difficult to recall these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of wasted opportunities.
Years after I threw in my first ballot, there were really changes.
It was definitely none of what I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied achievements – from the law on accessible care through the departure of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy “not to ask, not to say anything” after the death of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that the foreign obstructions have diverted so much effort to move our nation forward: among others, it is immigration reform, the opportunity of the public to choose health care and the closure of the base in Guantánamo.
But after many situations, when I defended Obama's administration from my colleagues and friends, I reached an absolute limit as regards the explanations that can provide.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
Obstructions of the Republicans cannot explain their consent to listen to foreign leaders or to drones killing innocent children overseas.
It cannot be explained to them that the National Security Agency is collecting data on the American's private life, nor that it is persecuting those who expose the government's mistreatment.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a fair trial or for restricting public contributions and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify finding a report saying that the White House's efforts to silence the media are “more aggressive... than Nixon's administration.”
And the newest and unable to excuse the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the Law on Available Care of a Simple Website.
I don't know if that's what you'd expect.
At 18 years of age, I should have known that government power could be in conflict with the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the elected function has no predictable progress and our public talks will form an opposition political party and accidental events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I mentioned above seem largely to be the result of my own administrative decision.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unbroken alternative and seemed unable to consolidate his policy or position.
I felt that the second term of office for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, would fill the hope we had heard about.
However, the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support dropping below 45% this week – is becoming more difficult through this book.
They make me remember the many promises that have disappeared.
This week, I read a chapter in the book on how Obama suffered a devastating defeat with Clinton in primary school in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to the pace and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.
The ideas expressed in this commentary are solely Nathaniel Morris' views.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict with interests over the parental leave programme
Billiardary and Member Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict with interests over a parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The Banya magnate, who is arguing over the repayment of the carbon tax amount of $6 million, made this statement when he was trying to get the question from the table whether there was a conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a crucial role in deciding whether coal and mining taxes are to be collected.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only the ministers could be at conflict of interest, and added that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could benefit personally from the policy.
"He got into a great conflict of interest with regard to paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters got pregnant, he would be directly interested in getting a parental leave," Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the election committee officially declared Mr. Palmer a winner of the Fairfax district victory in Sunshine Coast, thanks to 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closure of the election rooms?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come, type details into the computer, vote immediately, and get results at 6:30 p.m.?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to label ballots.
Is it that results can be fattened if someone doesn't like them?
These days and at this time, the use of pencils seems unbelievable.
The electoral commission studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political programme also applied to the Sunshine Coast airport and that he would take his new work “very seriously”.
The public office is a public service.
"We are not seeking any reward except that we can serve the society at this critical time," he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have found that washing your hands is changing your system.
The experiment was attended by 98 people divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving an insurmountable role.
Of course, both failed.
But the group that had washed their hands after failure seemed much more optimistic than the one where the participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the "washed hands" group did better in the next test than the other one.
Yet, those who washed their hands in other tests achieved worse results than those who did not wash them.
The results of the "washed" were at the level of a third group whose participants did not experience any previous failure.
According to psychologists, the results of the test indicate that physical cleanliness actually removes negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, motivation declines, the tested have to concentrate much more.
If we transferred the results of the research to the Czech Republic, we'd probably be the most optimistic on our way back from the toilet.
After using the toilet not only washes the hands of one percent of Czechs and Czechs, but after travelling by public transport it is already a fifth.
Most of the time, after working in the garden or in the workshop, 85 percent of the people will wash their hands.
The pet caressing motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, how much it is necessary to wash your hands after handing to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks will wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Though it would be on the spot, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to do so a little bit better," said research results from skin doctor Klaudie Komárková.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
According to two persons informed of the situation, the Scottish Royal Bank (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that the global investigation by the control authorities concerning suspected currency market fraud is increasingly common.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed their cooperation with competent authorities in the world's largest financial market investigations, where the owners of USD 5.3 trillion change their ownership every day.
The mention of the two traders would be suspended by the first RBS staff in the context of an expanding investigation that would respond to the LIBOR rate manipulation scandal (the London Interbank Interest Rate).
The Bank refused to comment on the suspension but confirmed that it received an information request from the authorities this month.
"Our non-stop search continues in this matter and we cooperate fully with the FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people who have close access to this event said that the RBS transferred to the British Financial Behavior Authority the records of e-mails and quick messages sent from accounts and to the accounts of a former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is expected to have been released from his current position as European Foreign Trade President at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European President for Cash Trading in Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former money manager at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were charged with any offence.
Mr Usher's group for sending quick reports were the bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, said people dedicated to this event.
This week, UBS stated that after the Swiss control body informed Finma that it had investigated suspected foreign currency machinery in several Swiss banks, it had taken steps against one of its employees.
Worldwide, at least six authorities — the European Commission, Finland, the Swiss Anti-Monopoly Office of Weko, FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Office — are investigating allegations that these bankers have joined in moving with the currency market.
In addition, people said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had launched internal investigations or received an information request from the competent authorities.
Banks have been getting rid of old fast messages and e-mails for years to find cases of misdemeanors.
Investigative reports have intimidated traders in an area that was one of the largest engines to generate profits in the closures of investment banks in recent years, but which was disturbed by the fact that small currency volatility limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to reduce the severity of the situation when they claimed that with a large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, it was essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say that this is not necessarily true.
The high-ranking trader said that despite the considerable volume of daily trading with foreign exchange for winding up liquidity between different trading platforms and banks, increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that "you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices."
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that she had released from her department for trading in shares of a trader, which caused the loss of nearly USD 6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank shall immediately inform the competent authorities and cooperate with their control authorities.
“We believe that this trader acted alone and that this problem has been resolved,” said Credit Suisse.
The number of HIV infections in Prague exceeded 1,000
Doctors in Prague have been recording more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the monitoring in 1986 until the end of this third quarter, the tests confirmed the disease in a total of 1005 persons from the metropolis.
This results from the statistics of the national reference laboratory for the AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to her, there were 2,063 infected in the entire Czech Republic.
Immunity failure has already ruptured in 396.
198 people died.
The number of infected in the Czech Republic has increased annually in recent decades.
In 2002, the tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later it was 121.
In 2009, the survey revealed 156 new diseases and in 2010 then 180.
The previous number dropped to 153 last year, but it was a record one.
According to the lab, there were 212 of them.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases this year is over 200, I believe there is no doubt," says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who for years led the Prague Light House for patients.
From October to the end of 2011, the tests revealed the disease in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavátý said.
In September, doctors reported 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests were confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS broke out in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Anyone who really wants to meet a city should go to the cemetery.
His visit reveals more than a walk through a busy centre with monuments, churches and galleries, more than would betray a bedekr.
Many people are "a number of graves".
They slowly roam the cemetery and gain an intimate view of the local reality.
They find out what kind of people here live, what nationalities, what beliefs, how large and cohesive families belong to, how old they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
In what way do they express their social standing, their taste.
And from the condition of the graves, they learn how they care for their dead.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama is in line with the Constitution, which is a major victory for Obama's administration.
By a vote of 5:4, the court decided that the individual order of the Law on the Protection of Patients and Available Care – which requires citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise threatens to pay the fine – does not deny the Constitution on the basis of government tax authority.
The president of the court, John Roberts, was on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remaining part of the 2,700-page Act and further decided that the legal requirement for health care, which the States are ordering to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, would otherwise threaten to oust all the financing of sickness insurance from federal sources, is not forced and contrary to the Constitution.
26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises filed an action to block this law.
During the premieres of 2012, the law strongly rejected each of the main Republican candidates, including Mitta Romney's proposed candidate.
In the words "Mugabe is a lame donkey" no longer threatens prison, the law annuls
Until now the Zimbabweans have had to pay good attention to how the public talks about the nine - and - a - eighty - year - old Mugab, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, then has been at its head since the end of 1987.
In accordance with paragraph 33 of the Criminal Code, a fine of $100 to one year of imprisonment was put at risk for contempt by the President’s office.
"The state's representatives should not accuse people who comment on the President in pubs or in other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government has appealed against the decision of the court to inform the British BBC.
A number of injured Zimbabweans, including Tendai Dang, who were arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in a bar fight.
In May, an opposition activist who was attending Mugabe's audience ended up in prison with a whiny ass.
In August, the prosecutor accused a 26-year-old man of his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The court has also declared that there is a constitutional law restricting media freedom.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements later prove false," said Deputy Minister of Justice Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwean law has made it possible for a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment.
"The existence of a law allowing to criminalize someone for an untruthful statement has a freezing effect on the right to express themselves freely," Malala added.
Despite Mugabe ruling the country with a firm hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with wider civil liberties on the basis of a referendum in March.
Small steps from the dictatorship of one man, the country came in 2009 when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition took place in the Prime Minister's chair, Morgan Tsvangira.
However, the countries continue to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008, the world’s highest inflation, which has exceeded 100,000 percent.
Therefore, in 2009 the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today in Zimbabwe only payments are made by currencies of other states.
The poor economy is going towards Mugabe's reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000 he redistributed the land of white farmers between his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience walking on the farm.
Central banks will maintain swap lines permanently
The temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, Bank of England and the Central Banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument to enable banks to access global currencies whenever they need to.
The banks made that statement in their joint statement.
"It is a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, the main international economist of London's Barclays Bank.
"So far all the transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not in my opinion any surprise," adds Vojciech Benda, BH Securities' main economy.
Central bankers are strengthening the bonds that began in 2007, when the international credit market first faltered.
Central bank agreements allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
Central bankers' decision comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to end its programme of support for the US economy, which could avoid the price of money on the global market even higher.
The swap contract is used by default to overcome the liquidity deficit of one currency at the same time as the liquidity surplus of the other currency.
It can be seen as a one-currency deposit and another-currency loan.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in the European Bank.
The EU has agreed on bank supervision, the ECB will oversee 150 banks.
How Tipsport (does not) delete personal data.
More than a year ago, I made registration on Tipsport.cz.
But then I didn't finish it, because someone on the branch just sat who couldn't complete the Internet registration.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration failed, then I moved, and that changed my address and ID number.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that I couldn't do it because I have another OP number, address and that it just couldn't finish and that I have to ask for data deletion and make a new registration.
So I did, and on 24.10.2013 I wrote on technical support that I am asking for the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable Personal Data Protection Act.
For that, she wrote me technical support to finish my registration on the branch office.
This started the e-mail marathon for technical support, which eventually after the 4th of September 25th, they wrote that personal data on my request had been deleted.
So you would think that you could do the new registration and here you started again the problems first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (it was not deleted – it is not a personal data, but it is also deleted).
So I used another user name and it came to me that my personal data was already stored to complete the registration on the branch (how can they store something that claims to have been deleted?), so I contacted again technical support.
On my question of how it's possible they wrote me off that they actually deleted the personal data on 25.10. and to send an email with that error.
That's what I did yesterday around 3:00 p.m., and they texted me today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that's why I couldn't do it because I used the same name and date of birth.
What about the fact that I've been in contact with technical support for a week, and I've decided that I still can't do it.
And what if it were true what they claim (which they do not) no one could register with the same name or date of birth if this is already registered.
By the way, in those 13.22 I actually registered on the same name and date of birth, but I used a fancy e-mail and phone number and world wonder, a page appeared to me that they sent me a link to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register to the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport weighs registration on e-mail and phone number and data just didn't cut off as he claims.
So I once again told this technical support that they just lie (either intentionally or not knowing what they're writing), because what they're writing isn't true.
I've written a few screenshots that the registration problem was before 31.10. So "false" registration simply doesn't affect this.
I'm sorry, but since you're re-registered, we can't verify your claim.
And the communication is over.
It also repeats the same sentence that registration is bound to the name and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration wasn't completed by clicking on that link in the e-mail and it didn't actually work.
So if I sum it up, Tipsport not only did not erase the data as it claims, but it also lies when it claims otherwise.
Worse than that, you can easily prove how they lie and try to make it look like the error is on the customer's side.
By the way, after the introduction of this matter on my personal blog, things were put on the move and from Technical Support came an e-mail that the matter was transmitted for inspection and will be informed (after a week of emergency and guessing and alerting to the same error).
Music plays in the subway on the Bridge
Prague has launched the music project in the metro.
The first ostrich, where reproducing instrumental music plays continuously during the subway operation, is Bridge line A on the exit to Václav Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
Textwriter Michal Horáček brought not only his new two CDs Czech calendar to the Hall of the Cologne Municipal Social House, but especially to us singers Lenka Nova, Františka Segrada and Ondru Rumla, accompanied by the excellent Orchestra of Mateje Benka.
After the intro and the acting ethud about the late musician, he gradually invited Michal Horáček to the stage all three singers, came himself with a candle in his hand and recalled the story of the last time they played in Cologne and in the theatre, and electric power fell out throughout the city.
"Otherwise, in Cologne, they produced two kinds of cards, with which I came very much into contact," he recalled.
He also reminded President Zeman's cousin.
"Perhaps we could make a tour after Zakolani or Dúbravce near Bratislava," he joked about the parents of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and, if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical act.
The calendar was also done by Josef Manes, who put it on an eagle, about ice hockey, but then he had no idea how we meet on these squares and we're chanting who doesn't jump, there's no Czech.
That's the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we won't play here today," he entertained.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang from this board for him a very suitable Sleeping Day, singing at night, and accompanied him to her guitar.
Otherwise, if he didn't sing, he played drums, all three singers accompanied the band in the composition of the keyboard, cello, guitar and bass.
All three vocalists sang together a little shivering In the bosom of the heart sitting, which immediately dispersed the auditorium.
"I am glad that you were interested in the song, which surprised me in Kmochov city," Michal Horáček responded.
After the memory of Peter Hapko, I recognized that in František Segrad, in the original of Richard Müller, rewarded with a huge applause, Han Heger recalled his father’s song, and he loved Líd Baar and Horáček’s explanation of the communist ban and the replacement of Baar’s American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocáb recalled Sebastián's composition, and Segrado sang Prague's beautiful song, composed by Jarda Svoboda, a sad relative and former Cologne.
But that was the conclusion, the applause in standing and the addition in the form of an optimistic composition We live in beautiful times.
There was another addition ready on the playlist, but the fans no longer applauded.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four sat behind the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček's books and even the packaging from the legendary LP and with any interested ones took pictures.
Berdiah with Štěpánek will be complemented by Rosol and Hájek
In the finals of the Davis Cup against Serbia, the non-player of Czech tennis players Jaroslav Returned to Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
Czech trophies defend themselves, but they go to play on the course of the rival in the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on the hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
In the final, Czechs are the third in five years.
"We know we're going on hot ground, it's going to be wild and we need to focus on our performances as always."
"We will go there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Štěpánek, an uncle of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama to bomb Syria.
U.S. Command in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis showed exactly what Syrian bombing would look like.
Without unnecessary humbug, threats and millions of declarations, planes were sent out, you hit the target and came back.
Without being cuddled by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole action, and they are no longer in favour.
Quite the opposite of confused and big-mouthed, acts of undeniable Obama's Syrian politics.
And the most satisfying thing about the attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Do not confuse the media with their claims that "Syrian base" or "supplies for Hizbalah" has been bombed.
I recently wrote here about the fact that while US aid to secular rebels in the country remains only rhetorical, Russia happily continues to deliver arms to Syria.
And it was a fresh shipment of Russian rockets unloaded at the port of Latákia that became the target of an Israeli raid.
It's a clear message.
And notice, once again, Israel bombed the Asad regime, not the insurgent, although it should be the opposite of popular Internet theories.
The U.S. government has awarded two members of the Special Forces, possibly Delta Force.
He didn't know until now that they were honouring themselves during the attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi.
It is known that the heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA area in the city was, in my opinion, members of the CIA's secret command, which was made up of former soldiers.
For a long time, there was speculation as to what SEALs were doing at the consulate or even in another CIA residence.
It's clearer now.
However, the information that the CIA in Libya has its authorities protected by machine guns (just one such both SEALs died after a mortar hit) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about those two unknown heroes.
They were part of an American command in Tripoli, and as soon as they received a report of an attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene and, together with five private contractors, they shot their way into the CIA compound in Benghazi.
The Obama administration is embarrassed by the fact that during that attack, the command was not officially deployed and completely and that it was simply hesitant about what to do.
The commander of the command will probably release these volunteers without orders.
Anyway, it's not a one-time thing in the country, but the US Command, CIA agents, and private contractors are pretty interesting information.
And that is because nothing has been officially admitted until recently, and even now, there is only some NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's a good thing the US is trying half way to counter terrorism in Libya.
Even though it would be much more helpful to resolve the national situation.
The last secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coastline of Iran.
It's not so long ago that the media almost sang Iran's air force to pursue U.S. drones.
Little is known, however, how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to find your drone in the air space, there's nothing you can do about it.
However, if an Iranian drone is discovered in an international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that Iran's F-4 Phantom was chasing an American drone in the international seaspace, where maybe the first sharp deployment of an American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He gave Phantom the impression that he would be able to verify his weapons optically without registering him on the radar or simply noticing him, and then when he suddenly appeared to him and invited the Iranian pilot back to his home, he listened without a return.
There's no wonder when Phantom is an airplane of American production, but he remembers war in Vietnam.
He can't compare to Raptor.
We want to show that Plzeň still knows how to win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has been largely unsuccessful recently, the defence officer or publisher Viktorie Plzeň František Reitoral has a form that brought him back to the representation after a year.
He's also good at shooting, playing a game, and he's got a penalty kick in the game in Teplice.
Victoria reached out in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice after winning, but eventually one point out of these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes that his team will break an unpleasant series in a match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will defeat Jablonec at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The man is carefully preparing for a heavy match with the Severochés, who play offensive football.
Everything is moving towards a match with Jablonec, the coach is preparing us well, as we always draw a lot from the video analysis of the player's game.
"I believe Friday night will be a great match," lured Czech fan to Doosan Arena stands.
The last fights didn't go as well as she wished, but the word of the crisis defender Victoria refuses.
That's how football works, sometimes you're in good shape and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't be talking about the crisis in any way.
"I believe we are going to win on Friday and it will be good again," says Western defender.
The manhood of Victoria will again rely on the support of fans.
"He's playing Friday night, and that's what I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we will repay them with a victory," Rajtoral adds.
Jana Pétová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it that way, it's not really a step at all, but a big leap - a leap a few years back, into memories, into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like, not having any worries and just coming out of school and washing dishes, deliberating and doing tasks.
Although these "obligations" were mostly just theories, parents' wishes.
The practice was completely different - running out of school, throwing the bag in the corner and running out.
Play other kids ball games, jump shots.
Then, at Helena and her boys' show, embroidering a chain stitch with a festive napkin for Grandma's birthday.
And then after a few warnings wash the dishes finally, relax, in winter apply the wood to tiled stones and tasks to do until after dark under the lamp (or rely on a schoolmate and instead of writing the love poems addressed to school love).
In the morning, to eat homemade strawberry jams (from real fruit, not the jams that are sold now, the contents of which were not even lying) and to drink it with tea from dried herbs, which my mother and I loved so much.
I also remember those magical evenings when the tomb was quiet in the room, when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio on the tapes that were loudly rolling in the old cassette book after Mom.
And then, on the pencil, we used to roll the tapes and play the same song over and over again, our favorite song, and drink to it with a siphon.
Or we made a phone call over the table using cans that were tied together with a rope - and when we had to make the phone call to hear better, it was necessary to thoroughly clean our ears, then the earpiece was sorghum + watt.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live out it so that we were not missing anything.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPads or even mobile phones and laptops or brand clothes.
The clothing was inherited from generation to generation and the best "correspondent" in the wardrobe was a boutiqued T-shirt of homemade production using SAVA.
From electronics, we had enough to be satisfied with Mom's tape recorder and, to the best of all, Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which we used, by the way, only on the train on the school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hop or Man, don't be angry, or as I said, "Just" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, and I'm sure his parents had been saving him for a long time, but unfortunately he didn't warm up in our house for a long time.
My little sister picked up on him, said he was so good at paddling the tapes, so she tried to see if he could get a pin.
Unfortunately, he fell asleep, but it was his last shot.
Well, and this event still has, poor thing, on my dad's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was a little girl, she ripped the plug into the video and thought she was going to play the recipe and didn't win, so she still can't bake it.
I remember how we were able to communicate together, agree without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I had an appointment at Grandma's on vacation with our neighbor's granddaughter when we would meet next summer at Grandma's - and so it was, so it was.
We're together.
Promise me you'll see someone in a year!!
I also remember in winter, when we were running out with the whole village, building snowmen, riding on a snowy hill near a church on a haystacked sack.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the past day.
Of course, we used to listen to our sister before every dinner, the notorically-known sentence, "Be off your hands!"
Yes, that applies today, but you certainly don't have a soap attached to your tap in the lemon net.
After dinner, when Dad was working in the garage with Jarda from the village, my mom and I were lying on the floor, leaning our feet on the tiles, opening the door and watching the flames and listening to the cracking of the wood that came out of the stone.
We were closer -- really -- we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We were communicating together - we talked - we didn't write messages every day through different chats, text messages.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew so much about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially if I add these memories by looking at the album, where the black corners are carefully glued to black and white photos.
And if I didn't happen to know how old I was back then, there's always a year of taking the picture.
I see that although our chops by pot were too bad and we had pants on our cousin by two numbers bigger, no one was laughing at us before, it was so normal (not even IN).
And I'd rather go back that step forward to reality.
Until 2013, and I will expect what modern times will come up with, perhaps once for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of me are now so for a young teen generation at least somewhere "100 years behind monkeys" and I think they're losing a lot of time that they're not going to experience this "predominant" either.
I wish they would!
Google, Samsung and Huawei are being sued for Nortel patents
A group that owns thousands of patents from the disappeared company Nortel filed a complaint on Thursday for infringement of the patent against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, a company which was requoted during an auction during Nortel’s bankruptcy.
The Rockstar Consortium, which purchased Nortel’s patents for $4,5 billion, sued the US court in Texas of Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents include a technology that helps to connect the terms found on the Internet with the appropriate advertising, states the lawsuit, which is the core of Google’s search for business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones that operate on the operating system of Google Android, which strongly competes with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011 Google made a $900 million starting price offer for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and finally offered up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated in the battle for the patents of Nortel by Rockstar, Google received $12.5 billion from Motorola Mobility, which was a business motivated partly by a group of Motorola patents.
“Despite the failure to obtain patents that are the subject of the dispute, Google patents have infringed and continues to violate,” the complaint states.
Rockstar is seeking an increased compensation for the damage caused by Google because it says there is a violation of the patent by Google intentionally, as the complaint claims.
Miloslava Cejpková: November smile
She came out, four degrees Celsius, which we're not used to yet.
At first, she put off the smile, the one that kept putting on the show as a defense against the likes of friendly surroundings.
That made her very relieved because it was a mask she decided not to delay in public.
He was honest at home only on the days when she had grandmothers around her grandchildren Elina or Adík.
And of course, when her sons called.
She remembered very well the lesson from endless business skills courses.
Now they're really good.
To keep her loved ones quiet.
Then he flew into the corner.
It's like a disguise on a masquerade.
November, or the next month, she can't do the miracle to smile really, like when they were on a trip with someone who hasn't been here for nearly three years.
Egypt refers to the office of the first freely elected president
Muhammad Mursi made an inaugural oath, but his triumphant day would hardly end political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Mursi promised “new Egypt” when he was officially appointed as the first freely elected president of this country, after Husni Mubarak, who was planted 16 months earlier.
In his introduction to the office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian Head of State since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He swore an oath before 18 judges dressed in black plates in a mansion with a view of the Nile, which resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are working for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Mursí said at a lively ceremony on state television.
"The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Mursí, a 60-year-old engineer educated in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, which had been a major illegal organization since its creation for 84 years as a target of acute attacks by individual governments.
When Mursi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m., hundreds of soldiers and policemen were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters met in front of the court building to celebrate the president, and unlike Mubarak's presidential demonstration, the period was soon stopped so that the colony could travel usually through a busy road connecting the city centre with suburbs to the south.
Mursi’s personal prestige, mocked by the uncharistmatic “reserve pneumatics” of the Muslim Brotherhood, grew rapidly from his victory and his Friday speech, which was intended to present him not only as a candidate of Islamists but also to all those who want to bring an end to the rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mursi, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie of judges in a wood-covered chamber, where he swore an oath.
Mursí later traveled to the University of Cairo, where he was to present an inaugural speech.
While he was standing by, he got an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
Military commander of Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
His arrival was accompanied by the scandal “armadas and people are one hand” from the mouth of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 1970s became a garden of Islamic student movements.
Mursi made a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrír Square, where the revolution that ended the authoritarian government of Mubarak was born last year, and solemnly vowed to seize once again the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council, which took over from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to make an official oath before a court of law, rather than before parliament, as is customary, the will of the army has been chosen, suggesting that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi’s speech on Tahrír Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
They'll probably be police specialists in the ghettos, trying to relieve the tension.
Police specialists should be involved in ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They'd spend as much as half of their lives here.
They'd keep an eye on order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and people around them.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of Interior is counting on this.
According to him, improving the country's situation would mainly help to ensure "acquired social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor homes and quarters in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living in them, especially the Roma.
Adults in ghettos were unemployed, families were dependent on doses, children ended up in "special" schools.
It's a beech.
According to the experts of the problem sites, in the meantime, hundreds of people arrived.
Relationships between their inhabitants and others are sharpened.
Anti-Roma marches took place in several places.
Extremists were also joined by people from the area.
According to the interior, police are difficult in areas with ghettos of security and order to maintain.
It is said that the basic condition is "the consistent application of equal access to law enforcement".
But it is said that without a detailed knowledge of the place and people it is impossible to reach.
A specialist would go hiking in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his circuit.
He'd be keeping an eye on the order in the problem area.
He would also know the locals, so he could deal with problems or transgressions better.
"Thanks to the established trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole range of illegal acts," said the interior.
The ghetto specialists would receive an allowance of 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special officers into problem areas is to be built from Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now approximately 15.5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations began this year, a detailed proposal is being prepared.
The project is scheduled to take place by 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded sites is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements," the authors said.
How many specialists should there be in the Czech Republic, it is not clear yet.
The answer is to give an analysis to determine where a special officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money these members will be able to pay to the police once the project is completed each year.
According to the design of the project, the first choice is that of the police officers attending the internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen members should attend this training annually.
They'll be the most suitable candidates.
Special education should also arise for police officers who will operate in ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help improve the situation.
It's supposed to motivate and lead to integration.
According to the concept of the interior, there should be three categories.
The minimum standard would satisfy the hostels with precisely defined rules, such as the number of persons per room.
Medium standard would be in smaller flats.
Higher standards would have social housing comparable to normal housing.
The tenants would have to implement an integration plan to be drawn up by social workers.
They would have to comply with the housing regulations, take care of their health, send their children to schools, retrain and actively seek work.
If they tried to integrate, they would go to a higher standard of housing.
The intermediate housing system should operate for at least 30 years, according to the interior, until the next generation "in an integrally motivated environment".
The social housing model is being prepared by departments for local development and work.
They have to propose by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Uhlířský vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
The Coal Hill is an impressive hill 3 km south-east of Bruntal.
Together with several others, the recent evidence of the ferocious activity in the Low Jeseník period (geologically) is a document of the recent activity.
The last eruptions were still here at the beginning of the quarter.
In view of the greater distance, there is a prominent white rejected baroque pilgrimage church of the Virgin Mary Helpful, built in the years 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The host who was standing next to the church didn't behave.
Shortly after the church was finished, an alley was dropped out of four rows of lipes, about 1 km long.
The cross road on the Uglířský vrch is already the third version, the original one was here after 1916, the second one from 2001 only lasted until 2004.
On 15 stops are wooden plastics produced by the local art sculptor František Nedomlel.
He used various types of wood from the Low Jeseník region.
Similarly, the toppings in the area make up an interesting geological exposition.
The name of the sponsor shall also appear on each stop.
The charcoal top is the rest of the young volcano.
Although the data from the radiometric measurements of the age ranged somewhat, the last eruption was here about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Roudn (aged 3.3 million years) and older than Venus’s volcano (aged 0.8 million years).
Sopka was born an explosion.
At it, she threw out a large amount of boiling ash along with fragments of rock from the floor, which produced reddish color by burning.
At the end of this phase, it has leaked to the surface of the lava - today it is a layer of porous lentil up to 13 meters strong.
The second eruption cast red, brown, and places up to black tuffs.
Their layer is up to 50 meters high and its part is accessible in the wall of the fracture.
In the tufts there are noticeable volcanoes up to 1 meter high. The second eruption was completed by lava discharge.
At the conclusion of the activity of the volcano, the lava, which now forms up to 50 m of a powerful layer of the ostrich estuary, flowed out.
The spores in which the spores are replaced are the most common species of volcanoes.
Because they're actually composed of layers, they got the name strata.
The original conical cone was gradually subjected to erosion.
However, he was threatened with mining mining in a scrap on the south side.
The most intense exercise took place here in 1953 - 1962.
Tufas were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The trial was managed under pressure from experts and the public to stop and thus maintain this unique place.
The problem, however, is the porousity and small concoction of the rock that quickly fangs, falling apart and descending on the slopes.
Lom's disappearing so fast.
To make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-oriented slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The device is therefore problematic, but in time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are kept in a number of important locations.
You will reach the Ugliřský vrch after the green tourist destination from Bruntál, or Sleski Kočova.
Automobiles can use unpaid parking at the beginning of the July alley, where a short learning trail begins.
From the villa she moved to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in an apartment villa with a garden and pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villas in Orěchovka.
However, the original owners of the house won it back in restitution, and the tenants had to move away with a small distance.
So Ivan quickly sought a replacement home for herself and her older mother.
From the acquaintances received tip to apartment 3 + kk in the older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the vast forest park and the dam on the other hand inspired me," recalls Ivana at first impression.
At first, I thought it would be a three-year commission.
"Today we have been living here for more than 13 years, and not only because of the gradual reconstruction, I would not change," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter then moved from a hundred-and-a-centimeter apartment to a smaller one with a area of 62 m2 and almost all the equipment was distributed.
The action was not simple, things were stored with friends and the gradual management took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good shape, but the necessary adjustments had to be made, such as door painting or window replacement.
The previous owner knocked out the core, but the owner was most affected by the impractically solved and unnecessary large hall, and on the contrary the small bathroom.
The connection of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
Architects used to define the individual zones and the separation of the sadracardon room, which enabled new location of the lights.
The first intervention she decided to take after a few years was to remove the border in the living room.
This changed the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room gained air and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding green.
Another step to partially improve the standard was the replacement of the floor from PVC to laminate.
Ivana didn't know how to use the bathroom.
For years, I've been picking up magazines about housing and looking for inspiration.
In one of them I recently discovered an interesting realization.
I therefore made a recommendation to young architect Kamila Douděrová.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," Ivana said.
Due to the restructuring of the bathroom, it was also possible to adjust the available hall.
The architect connected room toilets and bathrooms and two doors with open wings replaced one with sliding ones, thus saving the place.
The bathroom is overtime and also sufficiently barrier-free.
The quality plates imitate the sandstone, there is also a comfortable seat in the shower, a bidet shower in the toilet.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Douděra continued.
As part of the show How to build a dream took place quickly but a major change in the living room, where also architect Martin Čeněk participated.
We had to have three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without helping ourselves with the classic principles of optical division, halfwaywayways, or Japanese walls.
"This would result in a breach of openness and unity of space," explains the architect.
It was originally managed to separate the sleeping and living area.
It was enough to turn the backs of two sofas and put between them a peace-made bucket of feathers.
The dining area defines the shades of the floor and the painting.
On the floor of the kitchen and dining room, a high-quality marmale architect used a sliding door to revive the wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchenette shall be covered, if necessary, by sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new floor of the anti-allergic marmale has many advantages compared to the previous laminate: soft non-slip surface without spores and better sound insulation.
The system of locks and pads from the adhesion marked with color is a demonstration of how you can work with space in the panel.
I left the colors on the architects, I wished it was happy.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in my previous apartment," Ivana says.
The pattern of the graphs glass with the motif of the flourishing magnolia is practical and creates a significant aesthetic element.
To a warm energy tone, architects have chosen a white one that has undermined a modern functional style.
In a small apartment, it was possible to store books, among other things, into the space under the window parapets.
Everything is within reach, lamps are comfortably controlled remotely.
In the revised interior, the contrast of the new with the older one works perfectly, for example with ten years of crystal chandelier and with quality art items that Ivan has collected throughout his life.
The last one came to the kitchen.
The lockers were previously placed on both sides, and the owner felt a bit like a tunnel.
The architect had taken their number and rewrote the placement.
The furniture in the simple design is made for a custom, the white area softens slightly the pearly surface.
They entered a small space thanks to the creative solution of the washing machine, dryer and dishwasher.
The appearance of the small kitchen revived the glass lining of the walls above the work desk.
The unique graphic glass with digitally printed motif is attractive, in addition it is well maintained.
Ivana chose the flowers of magnolia, which remind her of her favorite neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now she seems happy here too.
In the original bathroom there was a small van and a washbasin, the new owner chose a neutral shade of the bedding.
The big shower corner has Ronal's glass door.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from the environment in which functions and equipment will be in harmony.
The interior was materially and colourfully unified and we tried to find its elegant, cosy, not overcrowded appearance.
"The next condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the ability to move around the furniture and reach daily objects," adds Kamila Douděrová.
The Supreme Court ruled: Times can be fought.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Peter Nečas could also be prosecuted for any crimes that could have been committed before August's dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies.
He was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
On the contrary, in the case of former ODS Members Ivan Fuksa, Mark Šájr and Peter Tluchora, he decided that it was not possible to punish them for any criminal offence until they surrendered to the parliamentary mandate last November, said High Court spokesman Petr Knötig.
By this decision, the court rejected the proposal of the Minister of State, Iv Istvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with Members.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative positions in state firms for giving up their mandate and not causing problems in the approval of laws.
On the contrary, it is possible to pursue further the former prime minister who offered them these posts.
With Welly Bart, they also detained an officer of the anti-corruption police.
Bart's defender, Oldrich Chudob, who also represented him in the case of alleged VV MP corruption, also did not want to express himself too much on the case, but said, "Yes, I represent the client in this matter, but I cannot continue to comment on this in view of the protection of classified facts."
According to the law, the case is resolved by the General Inspection of Security Corps (GIBS).
The T.C. stated that Barta could buy classified information from the police.
According to the First Report server.cz, the case may have been related to the cause of former police President Peter Lessy, whose appointment to the office of Bart allegedly sought.
The latest legal information, however, shows that the arrest of Víta Barta and Peter Lessy are not related.
The speaker of the police bureau, Eva Kropáčová, refused to comment on the matter with the fact that the case concerned the Prague City Office.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," the spokesman for the Municipal State Department in Prague, Štěpánka Zenklová, said on Friday.
It is precisely the case that the prosecutor of Bart’s case supervises, and her words thus indirectly indicate that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted under the confidentiality regime.
Reporter Novinek managed to reach Víta Barta Katřina Klasnov's wife in the morning before their residence on Klárova, Prague.
She was just loading the trunks in the car and she was leaving.
She refused to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, Bart's detention was expressed by the leader of the Movement Svet Tomio Okamura.
According to his words, he has no idea what this is about.
"The greeting of Bart was one of many candidates of many parties to our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Christmas of Direct Democracy, Tomia Okamura," he added.
Vít Bart, who has been unsuccessfully running for the Movement of the Christmas of Direct Democracy, Tomia Okamura, is known for his corrupt cause for paying members of the public affairs.
In April 2012, he was unlawfully sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
The verdict was changed and Bart was acquitted.
I want a contract at the NHL.
I've still got the juice, the lust and the enthusiasm.
For Prospal, the family was always in the first place, so at 38 years of age, they want to submit to her completely.
Either he gets a job overseas, and he's going to extend his career, or he's definitely done with hockey.
"I want to do my father's and husband's role."
"I look forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still in vain waiting for the offer.
Despite the fact that he's a declared employee who never fails.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on ice and can take down his teammates.
And despite the fact that he was Columbus' most productive player in the past season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still there," he declares with determination.
Maybe he'll be looking forward to it, allegedly being the New York Rangers, who didn't make it into the season, and they've got two strikes, Rick Nashe's attackers and Ryan Callahan.
What does your arrival at Rangers look like?
It's just speculation.
As long as I don't have anything on paper, there's no point in dealing with it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post that they should sign me, but that's it.
Nowhere else has it been delivered, that's what really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce that I have a contract, but it just isn't.
Didn't you even hear from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place on a daily basis.
That's where it's about to get into a situation where the contract is really coming to an end.
When a player gets hurt or somebody doesn't, the manchaft doesn't.
There are a lot of different factors that I need to meet together to get the contract.
But that's exactly what happens in New York City, isn't it?
The injured is Rick Nash with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't make it into the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
But the other thing is, you always need two sides for that.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten one yet.
Unfortunately, that's the reality I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, are you expecting something to just click on?
I've had these expectations since July 5th, when the NHL opened up the market with free players, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
No, I'm going to Tampa for the kids and my wife.
Looking forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
It's given to me to be a father and a husband, and it's all gone away.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna be a dad and a husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
On Sunday, Vasik has two hockey games, that's a holiday for me and my whole family when we can go back to supporting our children in what they want to do.
You think you could do this on full-time import tickets?
Sure, you can think about a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 matches for knee surgery.
And I was very, very amused.
One day it's gonna get to such a stage that all goals, victories, and subscriptions won't replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Whatever job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could meet me apart from my family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play NHL just because it's NHL, or is it family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, the first place - except for the family - is sports success.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is about.
My children, so excuse us, our children - mine and my women - grew up in the States, started going to school there and so on.
And we would very much like to see them continue in this trend.
Because what we're going to do is, in America, there are possibilities somewhere else.
That's the chance we should offer them.
So you plan to stay in America permanently?
We're gonna practice it like we've done so far.
This means that in summer we will be in the Czech Republic and in the vicinity of České Budějovice.
And in winter again in Tampa or where our steps will take us.
That's perfect, being still warm.
I've been very lucky in my life.
You could say that I went across from him, it cost him a lot of strength and denial, and it took away a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That we can choose where we live with a woman.
There's a lot of people in the world who are after this to choose what they're gonna do and how they're gonna live.
How long will it take you to work out, train hard, and wait for an offer at your age?
Yeah, well, that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the desire, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have on NHL that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell how much longer it's gonna be there.
That can't be planned.
So you can say that this season you're going to wait for it to roll out and then decide what to do next?
I'm in a phase where I go day after day.
Recently, the CEO of ČEZ announced that the decision to build the 3rd and 4th block of Temelín power plant was postponed until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State energy concept and consenting to Contracts of differentiation by the government.
These reasons are why CEZ's current leadership is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, to major shareholders.
A qualified manager, however, should make recommendations, not hide behind.
Babish: Government only with Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš begins to reconcile that his movements of YES will not have the time to learn the political trade in the opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government in order to create one at all.
The president, YES, admitted it in an interview for the law, which will come out tomorrow.
Trade and marketing of ŠkoFIN leads Abrahamek
Its competences include product area and marketing and strengthening cooperation with trading partners.
He replaced Man Shantora in his post.
Abraham’s last 14 years of professional careers have been linked to the automotive sector.
He worked in Toyota Motor Czech, then in Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for the brand and dealers of Alfa Romeo for seven years.
His last position was that of Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of manager of the automotive division for over five years.
The ŠkoFIN was founded in 1992.
Police have been evacuating the shooting part of the Los Angeles airport.
There was a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
The police evacuated part of the airport, allegedly three terminals.
Reuters, with an appeal to the California media, claims that the men of the law shot an armed man with a rifle.
The Los Angeles Times, with reference to the police, reported that there had been a shooting that injured two or three members of the Transport Safety Authority.
How many people have been injured and whether there are any victims, but it's still not obvious.
Firefighters are talking about events with more injuries.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The aim was to be Russian rockets for Hizbollah.
Israeli military aircraft allegedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latákía on Thursday.
With an appeal to the U.S. government's no-designate, CNN announced it.
Israel’s press on the explosion in the alleged missile warehouse was widely informed, but the Israeli government did not confirm it.
The Israeli military speaking on CNN's request refused to comment on the flight.
"We do not speak to reports from foreign media," she said.
According to the US government source, the target of the Israeli attack was a rocket and related equipment, which, according to the Israelis, could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hizballah movement.
AP's appeal to another American security factor informed that Russian rockets SA-125 were the target of an Israeli attack on Syrian territory.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the aim of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defence system.
Satellite images of the area of attack but according to the DPA showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva rockets.
In addition, the SA-3 missile batteries were seen on them, including a command centre with a missile tracking radar and their targets.
According to the Israeli television report, the rockets recorded have a 35 - mile [35 km] flight and could carry a 200 - pound [70 kg] head.
Israel has reportedly bombed missiles inside Syria at least twice this year, saying CNN and AP.
The Israeli army has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly declared that it will attack any shipment of weapons intended for Hizbollah or other groups designated as terrorist.
Is the Internet the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from tourists in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual base profit before tax to range from USD 325 million to USD 340 million compared to USD 305 million to USD 315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17 per cent increase against the record profit of USD 299.4 million from 2011/12.
Director-General Graham Turner said that Flight Centre created an 8% profit in the first half of the year and began to grow sharply during the second half of the year mainly in the Australian and British out-of-service travels.
"To date, there are 10 profitable countries and several are heading towards a record annual profit before interest and taxation," he said.
This includes Australia and Great Britain, which are traditionally our greatest creators of profits.
Businesses with recreational activities have risen during the second half of Australia, offset by a slightly weaker domestic travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre did well in the recreational area, while business clients spent less.
The American trade has recovered during the season's weaker half-years and is expected to bring a third year's profit in a row.
Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at $38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia moved to St. Petersburg
Ecological activists detained since September in Russia for protesting planned oil mining in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to St Petersburg.
Today, AFP has informed about this with an appeal to Greenpeace International Environmental Organization.
At the same time, she claims that the original charges of her piracy activists have not yet been withdrawn.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against the oil rig in the Arctic were transported from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg," the organisation announced in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA it was planned to move.
The environmental authorities first charged them with piracy, which, if convicted, threatened them for up to 15 years in prison.
Last week, however, they announced that they would replace this accusation with a milder riot, which threatens a lower penalty at the upper limit of seven years of deprivation of liberty.
Greenpeace, however, noted in today's statement that the allegations of piracy by the authorities have yet to come back as promised.
That means the arrests are now being charged with two crimes.
A powerful investigation committee last week announced that the piracy charge would be replaced by a riot charge.
But when 30 prisoners were brought before the committee this week, the charges of piracy were not dropped.
Instead, a new indictment was brought against everyone," the AFP quoted Greenpeace as saying.
The Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at Gazprom's oil platform in mid-September.
Ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise, sailing under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they've all been held in custody against which they've filed an appeal, but the court has rejected them all.
On prison terms, environmentalists complain.
According to AFP, the Executive Director of Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo said that moving to St. Petersburg would make it easier for families and consular staff to meet.
However, there are no guarantees that conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they may be worse," he warned.
Dutch King Willem-Alexandra was asked for help by one of Faiza Oulahsen's detained activists.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch called on him to talk about their situation during a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He claims that Malikí has a large share in the restoration of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be part of the work of fighting in neighbouring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
At least one Shakespeare game, 19th century novel, Romantic poetry and contemporary British literature will have to be studied in English literature classes since 1914.
The test will also include “the hidden text ” in order to motivate deeper reading;
Combined English literature and language courses will be abolished.
Since 2015 students will be required to have a language exam and will be invited to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue new foundations for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo radical change.
For other major subjects, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Office of Ofqual, which oversees the exams, will reveal changes in the structure of the exams, along with a new marking system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his summer speech, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is “a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our testing system to regain the trust of society” and that it is necessary to insist that the graduation exam be “more demanding, more ambitious and strict”.
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison of schools in Australia, mathematics is spent on average 143 hours a year and in Singapore about 138 hours a year.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have said that a comprehensive math exam – along with greater emphasis on this subject in the resulting ladders – will probably encourage schools to provide additional teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on “the problems of the real world”, including financial mathematics.
Ostravský primator Kainar: Cancer in ČSSD is not me
Before the elections, a long-suffering dispute broke out between the two wings fighting for influence inside the island of ČSSD.
It all culminated when Prime Minister Petr Kainar turned to court over the non-democratic assembly of candidates.
However, the actors of the cause did not want to express themselves too much so that the party before the elections would not be further damaged.
Now the voters' votes are numbered.
The management of the Istrian ČSSD on Monday evening invited the Prime Minister of Ostrava to step out of the way, and he will probably push for him to lose his post.
But Peter Cainar wants to keep fighting.
What is going on in disputes and who is on whose side he described in the exclusive interview for the daily.
How do you feel about the election?
ČSSD certainly counted with a much better result.
Did it hurt her in our country that there were disputes within the party in the media before the elections?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better election outcome.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the ČSSD is now.
It's a side that has its internal problems, it's internally ill, and people feel that everything is not okay in it.
They made it clear in the election.
What are these internal diseases of ČSSD?
The decline has been going through ODS for some time now, and, unfortunately, social democracy is taking place.
It is so that lobbyists, influential people who had previously expected to find their bands at ODS, moved to the people in ČSSD and have an impact on them.
Then it has to do with the fact that police are going through the offices of the Istrian Magistrate and collecting computers.
It shows that ČSSD is not only composed of people who want the good of all others, but many of them think primarily of their own.
The ČSSD is divided into two incorruptible camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current struggle for power between Haskovci and Sobotkovci.
But it's been preparing for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was only a foregleam of what is happening now in Prague.
The Hague’s wing gradually occupied positions so that after the elections the situation that weakens Sobotk’s wing could arise.
A person is in politics in a situation where he sometimes has to compromise.
But everyone has an internal border where the compromises don't work anymore, and that's my case.
Initially, I didn't want to run for office, but when I noticed the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Lubosh Zaorák that I would try to get to a regional candidate to strengthen Sobotko's wing as Prime Minister of Ostrava.
Hashk's wing gave him a stop.
Why are you standing on the side of Boguslav Sobotka, not Michal Haska?
I think Sobotka's fame is a person who always talks about the CzechSSD programme, and to some extent also about visions for the foreign party and for this country.
I admit I've never heard anything like it on the other side.
Michal Hashek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can only begin to appeal to the President of the Party.
It's a struggle for power, no matter what, and against the sides.
In my opinion, what Michal Hashek has now performed in Prague has ended his political career.
As you've noticed, you weren't approved by the Croatian leadership of the CzechSSD.
The political parties are based on the competition, which of their members will be located.
The competition should be based, for the most part, on programme visions and on the ability of those people to fill those visions.
Of course, there are also people who do not have many abilities or visions in this competition, but the political side is an elevator for money that they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people start getting ahead of themselves by breaking the rules without scruples, they break the party’s regulations.
By their practices, they make the mafia political parties and, in my opinion, they violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To point out this problem is more important to me than to consider whether a Cainar has a political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the provisions.
Is that why you have already submitted before the elections a proposal for a preliminary measure against the form of the ČSSD candidate in Moravskoslez region?
The current county executive committee of the CzechSSD in Ostrava is reinforcing its power by the fact that organisations that do not comply with it can cancel the new organisation’s purpose and phase out the uncomfortable members of the party.
An example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednarík from the representors' club, but he filed an action against it, and then they withdrew his expulsion resolution.
This shows that trying to respect the party's positions through the courts is the last option, but at the moment the other ways and control authorities within the ČSSD have ceased to work, it is the only option.
The strength of the leadership of the Istrian ČSSD led by Ambassador Adam Rykala is to withdraw you from the post of prime minister.
It is a public secret that the mayor of Poruba Lumír Palyza has a backdrop on this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Paliza are trying to do everything they can to call me back.
They promise people positions, they win votes, and then they strengthen their power on the side.
When I went back to the past, all that happened around the Baník Ostrava football club and buying the Basel Stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so that they could label me as the person who puts money where it doesn't belong.
At the same time, the city bought assets that were strategically valuable to it.
How, then, do you see this further with your stay in the role of prime minister?
The Periodic Committee has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in the ČSSD.
But I think it's like a thief screaming, "Get the thieves!"
When we look at the results of my work over the past eleven years, I don't see anyone in the island social democracy who would initiate and enforce, sometimes even against the members of the party, the emergence of as many developments as the industrial zone or the expansion of the science and technology park.
Yet everything becomes uncomfortable.
I don't read it any other way than to prevent others from breaking into the places they yearn for.
Are you going to fight these other people any more?
Because if this republic's supposed to work well, then the political parties have to work well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively drive the state if they can't control themselves.
So I don't think I'd leave the CSSD now, because I think whoever's causing this side's cancer is not me, but these people are trying to piss me off.
Olomouc opens in the historical center of public ice skating
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating, Pavel Burnen, said that preparatory work at the rink had been started on October 26th, and since Wednesday, aggregates for ice production have been in operation.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters high, and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The rink has a surface area of 375 square meters, and the stage took 358 square meters.
The skaters and passersby will also have two stands with punch.
"We expanded the floor area, enlarged the space in front of the stands and almost the entire floor area is covered so that the skaters can relax," said Burned.
Olomouc Streets are already reminiscing the coming Christmas.
Last year, a rink for repairing the Lower Square was installed right in front of the main entrance of the town hall in the Upper Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed on the slope of summer, so the ice area could return to its original location.
For the first time, people could skew right in front of the city hall in 2009, when the rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city.
Christmas markets, part of which is a rich cultural programme, will be launched a month before Christmas on the Upper Square.
Pamela Anderson had the iconic blonde hairstyles “screw off ” and put on a new, dramaticly grilled haircut.
Pamela's blonde hair is famous because of her role in the sexy TV show Coast Guard.
Pamela Anderson is the latest celebrity to shock her fans with a new haircut.
An ex-cat from the Coast Guard got rid of her long blonde hair and put a platinum grill cut on.
This 46-year-old actress revealed her last appearance change when she went out to LA on Wednesday and posted a picture on her Twitter page.
It's the first time in 20 years that this blonde has short hair, and we like this lingering change.
What do you think of Pammy's hair?

The brutal killing of a senior in Zlínsk will be reopened by a regional court
The Regional Court dismissed the indictments of a 25-year-old Slovak and a 23-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men refused to take the blame.
They're in danger of 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional punishment.
The speaker, Petr Angyalossy, confirmed that the Supreme Court annulled the decision of the Regional Court and returned the matter to him.
The reasons leading the judge refused to comment on the fact that the decision had not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the prosecution, a seventy - year - old man in his home was attacked by young men.
Senior died a frantic death.
According to the prosecution, the men strangled him, beaten him, and dug all over his body, as well as his metal object, apparently with a gas gun, put about three dozen wounds in his head.
The man suffered severe injuries, such as fractures of the skull bone, swelling of the brain, or bleeding to the brain that he succumbed to on site.
The youths reportedly took some 3,000 crowns and jewels worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the Regional Court, they were the only, in addition, indirect evidence against the defendants of foul play, which the expert considered not fully established in the sense of the legal guidelines.
Although the scents of the crime scene and other cases in more than ten cases coincided with the defendants, the police initially dealt with them as material and not smelly footprints.
In addition, there was some doubt in handling them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants has not been proven without doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head found relatives who thought he'd fallen and injured himself.
Nor did the medical doctor who called for rescue services warn of violent deaths.
So after a few days, criminals contacted disruptive doctors who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all the traces of the crime that the relatives cleaned up.
No DNA was found on the defendants' location.
The young Slovak lived in Hungary.
He is now serving an 8.5-year sentence, which was confirmed by the Olomouc Supreme Court last year.
The man, according to him, was the head of an organized group of six young men, who is conscious of a mugging of gold.
The looters took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopno.
The younger of those accused of the murder of a senior lives in the Uherský Hradišti.
The court released him after 11 months in August.
The sweat begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November starts in Znojme reconstruction of the football stadium.
On Thursday, the stadium was picked up by builders who would reconstruct the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojm is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week Strings of Autumn
The saxophone great and the legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will make the next Wednesday point for the 18th anniversary of the Struny Autumn Festival.
Shorter will perform on November 6th in the Grand Chamber of Lucerny together with his quartet composed of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, a spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the leadership of Martin Kumžák will be added to Shorter.
In Shorter's adaptations for the Symphony Orchestra, Pegasus from News Album Without A Net, as well as his older music Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which also proves that the Prague concert on the strings of autumn will start his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music over 60 years ago.
The number of artists he worked with ranges from Miles Davis through Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santan.
On his musical journey he also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitoush and Vitoush and Viennese cousin Joe Zawinul, whom in legendary Weather Report for more than a decade gave direction to a new style of fusion.
For the past 13 years, she has performed with Wayne Shorter Quarter in particular.
Some afterparty after the festival will be the club night Spotlight, which will take place on 9 November at the Roxy/Nod Club.
Along with the charismatic singer Andrei Triany, the local audience will introduce the Manchester Trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, which will bring the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
She says she forbids UEFA to publish penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairman of the Board of Judges of the Czech Football Association, has stopped publishing sentences for judges.
It is prohibited by the UEFA rules, which she stated in the interview for the Legal Notice.
Otherwise, he said he'd threaten FACR strikes.
Damková also refused to side with the football players of Plzna, where it came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are different, for example from Prague.
So in the case of the vote I can lose 1:6," said Damk in a reaction to the criticism that has upset after Plzeň has recently played twice as many penalts as the other league teams.
Therefore, even though the FACR has ceased to publish penalties for referees in recent months, Damková assures the judges that they are complaining about their mistakes.
"Trust me that if the Commission finds out that the referee has made a mistake, it will limit his delegation, however it may have been in any game," Damk said.
The reason why penalties are not published is according to the Damek ban on the European Football Union.
"EUFA prohibits and punishes the disclosure of such information."
"We're very suspicious of each other, and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We have made the restrictions public, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop, hard sanctions will come," Damk said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really an exception," she added.
If the disclosure of the information continued, it is said that the Commission could lose money from UEFA to raise and develop referees.
"And these are very important to us."
"Without them, we could not fill the program in the training of referees," Damk said.
Barta's detention has to do with Janoušek and Bhem: Are they behind the leak of wiretaps?
Police arrested the President of the Council of Public Councils, Barta, on Thursday.
Along with him was also arrested the head of the Analytical and Anti-Corruption Police Department Jan Petržílek.
The detention is related to the wiretaps of the lobbyist Roman Janoušk and former Prime Minister Paul Bém (ODS).
Information about the wiretaps received by the Novinka.cz server confirmed the Czech press office with a reliable source.
The intercepted telephone calls Janouška and Béma, which were released last March by the Youth Front daily Today, in which both men address each other "Mazánka" and "Kolibřík", show the influence of Janoušk on the steps of the city under Bem's leadership.
The daily reported that in 2007 they were received by the Safety Information Service (BIS) from which they fled to the ABL security agency two years later.
That's where he owned Bart.
Server News.cz noted that the detained criminalist Petržílek was working for the BIS just before he joined the anti-corruption police.
Petržílek moved to the anti-corruption unit, which was subsequently interviewed, at the same time that they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I can't confirm or say anything at all," said the prosecutor Michal Muravský of the City State Office in Prague.
He also refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The case does not want to comment on any inspection for the same reason.
Six companies out of ten prepare for the new Civil Code
Six companies of ten have been intensively prepared for the forthcoming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act since 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the companies surveyed stated that the issues related to the two key codes in their company were not dealt with at all.
This results from a survey by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which examined the views of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the approaching date of effectiveness of both key codes, a number of managers are just beginning to realize at the last minute what a significant impact they can have on their business.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years are, in our opinion, affecting all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
The business sector has lived in uncertainty about whether revolutionary changes will eventually take place or not because of the avalanche of politicians.
"Now, however, they have only a few weeks left to move to a new right for their companies without complications," Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spáčil commented.
Of 61 percent of the companies concerned with the new laws, 26 percent indicated that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to prepare them in time.
Furthermore, 35 percent of these companies are about to take the necessary measures soon.
On the other hand, every fifth company has not yet dealt with the reddifications, yet it has a specific idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent do not have an opinion and the problem cannot be assessed.
Only eight percent of companies have admitted that the issues related to the reddifications have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal issue related to the new civil code is the conclusion of new contracts (21 per cent), followed by the solution of business conditions (16 per cent) and changes in the cadastral property and liability for damage (by 10 per cent).
One of the most important innovations in the treaties will be the whole reddification, namely the unification of contracts only under the new Civil Code.
The current parallel adjustment in the Civil and Commercial Code will disappear as a result of which contractual law should become more transparent for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new adaptation will offer many news with an emphasis on greater freedom to organise relations," lawyer Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukáš Poddaň noted.
With regard to the Business Corporations Act, nearly a quarter of companies consider the most substantial topic of increasing the responsibility of statutory authorities.
The following are topics related to changes in the convening and the general meeting (15 per cent) and the representation of the company (14%).
The new legislation means tightening the obligations and possible impact on the statutory authorities, in particular in a situation where companies are at risk of falling or falling into.
"In practice, this means that if the members of the board and the managers of the companies do not deal with the care of the proper economy and do not reverse the threatening collapse of the company, they may lose the benefit of the performance of the function in the last two years," Spačil added.
Pierre Rainero: I’m trying to make Cartieru’s style grow like a living language
My task is to preserve tradition and at the same time lead our brand to modern things so that it does not remain a dusty relic, explains in an interview for the HN its position of Pierre Rainero, director of style at Cartier.
This French luxury house was created in 1847.
Travels through mud, river and jungle and provides medical care for free
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care at villages in Cameroon.
Bwell and his team treat almost every weekend hundreds of patients
There are not too many doctors in Western Africa; only one in 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates for CNN Hero's Year 2013.
In the CNN Prize 2013 contest, you can vote for him or any of the ten main candidates.
The winner gets $250,000 so he can continue his extraordinary job.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle watched his father go unconscious again and again and again and to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
In 1981, Jamef Bwelle was injured in an accident near the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he was treated only with a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain and created a hematoma that affected him his entire life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him outside Cameroon if we had the money to do it.
Instead, Bwell spent years transporting his father to crowded clinics and hospitals where he received such treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," Bwell says.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients there.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwell’s father died, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
For comparison only, the United States ratio is one doctor to 413 inhabitants.
And even if doctors in Cameroon could visit, many could not afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of health care expenditure in this country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Bwelle says.
They can't enjoy life because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 surgeries last year for free.
He himself became a blood surgeon in a central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded a nonprofit organization called ASCUIM, whose members visit rural areas on weekends, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have helped their volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are put in supply, attached to the roofs of medical care, and traveling through rough terrain to villages in need of help.
Not always accompanied by happiness.
Sometimes the vehicles must push through the river and the mud.
But when they arrive, they will be greeted as real heroes: feasting, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is a real reason to celebrate, and Bwelle, with his wide smile and unrestrained energy, is very willing to join the local joy.
The next day, hundreds of patients begin to be treated by the team.
“We have 500 patients on each trip,” Bwelle says.
They come to a village about 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide different health care.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasite disease, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get berells or gifted glasses or a free birth certificate – a document that is required by the school, but which many impoverished families simply cannot afford.
The team's doing a simple surgery under local narcosis tonight.
Surgery is usually performed in a school building, in a city hall or at home; after surgery the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to release the patient instead.
With light from the generator, the operating room and Bwelle’s hygiene equipment and his volunteers work early in the morning.
It's exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not lose motivation.
"Let us stay awake and continue working, play drums all night," Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team will head back to town, tired but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, performed 700 free operations last year and realizes that their assistance to the local population can be of great importance.
One man said he'd be able to work again after the hernia surgery.
"This will change the future for our family," said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and the work of the surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around Yaounde.
He says that this second job is financed by about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
“I’m not sure when he’s actually sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and works as a volunteer for Bwelle’s group.
He's always either in the hospital, or he's trying to get money for the organization so he can run these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
"Dr. Bwell we thoroughly washed our hands and removed the blood stains or held his instruments," O'Malley says.
As a second-year medical student in America, you'll never experience that.
Students volunteers usually pay their way to Cameroon by themselves and often arrive with donated medical needs.
But as soon as they get to Yaounde, food, transportation and study, Bwelle provides them.
“No doubt he’s a hero,” says O’Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
Well, for Bwell, a constant strain isn't a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life, fulfilling the promise that he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I’m doing this job,” Bwelle says.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope they see what I'm doing.
To make people laugh, to ease their pain – that's why I'm doing it.
Take a look at the ASCUIME website and see how you can help.
Minister Holcát reinstates the function of Chief Sisters for the Czech Republic
The main sister for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number exceeds 100,000 in the Czech Republic.
"I consider it essential that these functions be clearly defined and formalised so that the nurses of their representative within the structure of the office - representatives to whom they can always turn, if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses, and I think that the care sector deserves due attention from the Ministry as well.
In carrying out this profession, it is necessary not only to be highly professional, but also to have a human approach and personal conviction.
"I will be pleased and fully responsible to seek to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and excellent nurses in our health care, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us with their approach to patients to make their calls empathetic and help us improve the image of sisters in public," said Alena Szmídová.
The newly appointed Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, also stated on the occasion of her introduction, that she wanted to deal with the various aspects of the nurse's job and intended to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"Actually, I don't want to separate the profession of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to each other, each with their own powers and together with other health care professionals is a team of work that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the performance of the profession of sisters, these difficulties I perceive and intend to participate in their solutions."
These include, for example, the provision of simplification of medical and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some of the administrative actions of the sisters are unnecessary and they are taking away time that they could and should give to patients," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to improve team cooperation and management of health service providers, changing competences, as well as labour law issues, such as compliance with the labour code or non-combustment of their sisters with insufficient numbers at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous crumbs, which are not documented on a specific case where infringements of the rules may occur because of fear of possible harm.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, and so the function of the main sister of the Czech Republic could serve as a guarantee of the anonymity of such a complaint and a particular case should be checked by the competent authorities," closes Alena Šmídová.
Ms. Alena Šmídová graduated from the University of Karlovy in Prague in the course of Health Nurse (graduated in 1978) and Faculty of Arts at Charles University in Prague in the course of the Nursery - pedagogical study programme (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010, he has been the head of the nursing and other non-medical departments and the recognition of qualifications in the education and science department of the Ministry of the Interior.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse at the dormitory bed, and continued to work as a teacher at the High School of Health, where she was also eight years old as a statutory representative of the Director.
From 2004 to 2009, she served as the main sister of the Czech Prison Service.
She published a number of specialist textbooks on nursing and articles in professional journals, and she gave lectures in the field of nursing.
He's not a member of any political party.
So that I don't fall in love with hate
Writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after 12 years.
After years of reading, living, but not writing, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) is publishing a new novel Wind, darkness, presence.
That it is not a narrow union, the number of pages is comparable to the most famous work of Houstino (Peter, 2001).
For Salon Kahudu reported another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it so I wouldn't hate myself.
To see around us all the new and new clones of this foolish, foolish littleness, young organisms affected by blind selfishness.
I'm not even talking about us older, faces ruined by powerless applications, vexlaka soul and upside down ideologies who are trying to sell their "product" with the expression of small whores.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my juridical friends, weirdos and hidden structures.
I've been through this before.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning out of life on this planet.
I like to go for a walk, and then I read books at the lamppost tonight.
You're talking about the feeling of death, the hatred.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting old like all of us?
The fracture occurred a long time ago, about ten years old.
It didn't have a name back then.
Well, after that, I lived.
But there's still a surprise quiet boy in there somewhere.
I see another lone trainer, everyone in their anxiety tornado.
I was saved from writing books.
I've been participating in this oblivious, thousands of years of ongoing movement of life on this planet -- the spread of an unfathomable future.
The immense, breath-taking complexity of life, when every stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games, when experiment-omyl creates another and another generation of beings, which in trillions of interactions per second creates some superhuman, artistic intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as an ongoing process, or did you start completely from scratch?
Self - speaking, or better said dialogue, which leads the right and left half of the brain, sometimes floats to the level and forms into a book.
Like a period of peace being fought quietly by sleeping metastases of war, which may one day wake up - so my book is twelve years of silence clothed in words.
I could feel the silent avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I didn't do anything, one day I'd be quietly overwhelmed.
It is a set of questions that the brain has formulated and lays them down with layers that are stored in the darkness "under the surface of consciousness".
Neocortex, the grey cerebral cortex, asks the older evolutionary forces, goes to the ancient years of the brain tree.
He speaks to the wild beasts, asks the serpents, seeks the answer in the flight of birds, raises his sight to the clouds of the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry sky above me.
In the end, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express yourself metaphorically to the ego - could you define it biologically?
The brain retains in its billions of connections and electrochemical ties all memories, experiences and experiences that the person in question has experienced.
This forest, logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, registers of memory, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, I exhibited constantly variable presence, in a constant attempt to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
There are sometimes problems with overload.
Analogically - as if you "fell" PC, from a speech emulator program and translators from foreign languages you would first wrap yourself in the operating environment, for example Windows, and after a few failed restarts ended in a dark green flashing screen of Biosu, in a basic system that manages functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory etc.
For someone who hasn't understood what this is about, I'm talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
You mention her often - why do you care about this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In addition to the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - a breakthrough will appear.
Here it is good to read Nietzsche: "He looked so long into the abyss, when the abyss looked into him."
Risky feeling - that a person is lost if all hope disappears, psychologically "dead" and new quality comes in.
And why am I interested in this in person?
I'll answer with illustrations.
Once one fell into the shade and melted, ran for days, months and years, he kept melting and reading, and those books taught him how to swim - so to live.
He's become a diver.
I hope some of my written sentences will help someone, as the Count's texts once helped me.
To what extent do you think of a reader, a particular person who will read your text?
One who can't be said anything meaningful, one calls it consciousness, another super ego, but according to me it's best to characterize it in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else-- this reader is directly involved in the process of word formulation and sentence."
Ever since his early youth, he has read the book of old Czech fairy tales, sailed into Captain Nim's submarine, ran through the Shadows in dark alleys.
In the end, behind all the branches of the authors and their messages, it is: "The sun is clear to the worlds of other Karl Hinka Mácha".
What if there's a book outside?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
In the retrospect that comes to you through the people who read the book, does it?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, after years, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with their hard life decision.
Books are, in fact, "life" or, rather, "worlds".
They're encoded in letters, they have experience, the history of regions of the language.
Any time we can wake them to life if we let their sentences slide into their brain.
It's actually, in a way, something forbidden to the divine - to penetrate other and other life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
This is the fact that DNA is stored in magic - according to the old demonological books we are allowed to practice witchcraft.
After the publication of the book, you - as it is - waits for the chain of copyright reading.
I remember you used to love reading.
Are you going to go back to it with joy, or are you feeling different after years?
I'd rather just talk about it today.
And what did I find out about that?
Good intelligent people live everywhere.
Their basic sign - they're stealthy, they're not too self-aware, they're friendly radiated, you don't feel lonely with them.
I will give an example - in the town of Červený Kostelec lived (and I hope he is still alive) one curly bookie (called accidentally July), a cheerful fellow and a good girl's bull.
In a pianist, he introduced me to the individual articles of the chain of readers of my book Houstin.
I looked them in the eye, and then I was shown a torn, read-out copy of my book.
In despair, I just laid off the budgeted morning room and wept briefly.
We were all standing there, sneezing and drinking with tears.
Then the young blonde mongrel couldn't stand it, and he jumped out of the window with his roar into the snow curtain.
It was downstairs.
We ran out into the nightland and huddled with a happy rage of sensitizers, the painful soul of the countrymen and the stack of fallen patriots - poured out and squirmed as werewolves until morning.
Every book of yours is formal and contently different from the previous one.
Does it also apply to the text Wind, darkness, presence?
It's a story.
It's a story about one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin puts the words of an old Russian tale in the mouth of the people in his novel Suchodol: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog lying on it, a gray coffin.
It's terrible, it's scary, it's a secret.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Perhaps we once were devils in hell and draw - what role we will play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it on the free tide of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
It affects our desire from such depths and in such a wide range that it completely exceeds our horizon - and so, with complete certainty, we are doing exactly in the intentions of our programmed task.
We are rewarded with the influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to mate, die in defense and gain new personal territories.
Sometimes a disorder occurs and we radiate compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.
That's the answer to your question - a biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the coast of the ocean unconscious, and in a dented sheet made of a dirty pocket catches the tides of the wet wind.
I have to write so I can be human.
Obama's backing out of health care.
Following a wave of criticism, President Obama resigned yesterday from his often repeated and ambitious promise that "if you like your health programme, you can keep it".
With the appeal of hundreds of thousands of notices of notices from the Republicans' providers in recent days accused the president of lying to the American public.
Yesterday, Obama came out of his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have working health insurance can keep them," he said in his speech in Boston.
In view of what he called the “media disturbance” about the statements, Obama called on the Americans who received the notice to find new insurance policies on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more complex health care programme at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You will get a better offer," he said.
His administration argues that it should not be surprising that 5 per cent of the population who purchased the insurance on their own could be forced to change the scheme because their insurance does not meet the new requirements given by the Law on Available Care.
"I tell these Americans on the level: you deserve better," Sebelius said in her statement to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Law on Available Care, said that the launch of the Internet market has been going on since October "poor".
"I am disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to regain your trust.
Sebelius, irritated by this sentence, which was captured by an on-line microphone, said yesterday to a consultant sitting behind it at yesterday's meeting of the Committee, which was held after a stormy exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, who was concerned with whether she must be involved in Obama's care programme.
More than three hours during the Sebelius hearing, he repeatedly addressed the question of why the “architect” of the Law on Available Care did not voluntarily give up sponsored insurance by the government, and he did not buy a program through HealthCare.gov, which now imposes on millions of Americans.
What billionaire will you call next year?
Kellner, owner of PPF, wants to buy an O2 operator.
Both companies have confirmed the negotiations, and according to various sources from the agencies and behind the scenes, there is already a hand in the sleeve.
The notification of the transaction should take place in November, probably before the start of the auction of frequencies for LTE networks, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns KKCG.
This was released under the Sazka Telecommunications brand in the frequency auction for the LTE networks.
And to be a surprise, until then, the company's taste for telecommunications has not been talked about.
But now Sazku is leading a very experienced telecommunications mule Robert Chátal.
He started out as the marketing manager of the Radiomobile (today T-Mobile), then became director of the Slovak T-Mobile, and lastly he was head of the Austrian branch of the same operator.
The bet plays a few cards at once.
She signed up for the auction, and now she's admitting she wants to run the virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator into its network.
This would probably not be pleasant under the normal circumstances of Vodafone, but according to the Economic Newspapers, this may be part of much closer cooperation between both companies.
Vodafone currently suffers from the agreement of competing O2 and T-Mobile operators who will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner that way.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in a tend on the LTE network (as a newbie can tease a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone may not be allowed to auction at all, it will not be affected by irritation of only limited spectrum (not enough frequencies for all).
Vodafone can be shared with Sazko.
Vodafone will release the Sazka into its 2G/3G network (as well as the newly built LTE network at the 900 MHz frequency), allowing the company to launch the network quickly.
In the meantime, the box will begin to build a freight network of LTE, which Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Then Vodafone could spend money on a firm Internet provider or cable TV.
What about Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is a Czech daughter) immediately acquired a full-fledged operator with ever-decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big Moloch waiting for restructuring.
In the auction, the LTE network would have received Kellner already for O2 and very likely in co-operation with T-Mobile.
For both companies have already declared that networks will share.
The auction could finally end with success, but probably not with the high amounts the state budget is looking forward to.
And since next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two Czech business titans against the global trade.
Will Czech TV ever be around without signing events?
In the time of President Zeman, she entered a legendary scene with an ashtray, so it is not difficult to hear complaints that she collects evidence of pressing the castle type.
In the past, the traditional influence of such a Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Fortress has not been documented in this way, so that no one would sign it.
True, the leadership has become editors.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where such a preference of some journalists to the Zemanists is taken - whether it is a reaction to a direct order or not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of immutable empathic conceit.
And when we assume general corruption, we cannot forgive the question of whether the change in television conditions is sought by others, or by unscrupulous power interests, which have not yet been given the opportunity.
Truth is, those who say there are no open attempts to intervene politicians in broadcasting in developed countries.
The truth, of course, is that it does not mean that complaints about public media do not exist.
The complainants do not question their independence.
Rather, they criticize what they consider to be their own tendency, which is the product of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilization stage yet, and we don't have that situation.
But perhaps also in a country that thinks of itself as the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories of evil politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than the more complicated descriptions of an inexplicable situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings is affected.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: Presidents on the side of forces
It is almost a rule that at the key moments of the country there was no head of state in such a form that it could fulfil its national duties.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally five years younger, he would experience the end of his presidential period and events around Munich would be slightly different.
We probably wouldn't win the war, but after the symbolic resistance the air force could fly abroad, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not fight hard for their legitimacy.
And especially from that surrender, the nation wouldn't have hangovers to this day.
Beneš the statesman was not and was still in condition for Munich, but the war with him began to take place from the hills, and in February 48 he acted accordingly.
To be better at it, he could have gone to exile for the third time and violated the legitimacy of the communists and their people.
It's a shame to talk about Hach.
He was elected "Mr. President won't get into a situation where he's making a decision."
But he had to, even though the big decision was with the knife to Hitler's throat at the chancellor's office.
The head of intelligence František Moravec said in the last days in March 1939 that everything should be done so that the occupation, which he knew on the day exactly, did not go so smoothly and with such profit.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, but they didn't believe him, but they were afraid.
The human wreck Gottwald had his flying comrades executed, as Moscow ordered him to.
Ludvík Svoboda definitely failed to participate in normalisation and had to be put down, completely senile.
That Husak was powerless and a sick depressed old man in November 89 made it easier, but that's the only bet.
Havel's been lucky they haven't met him in the office in years, he's been spared the worst.
Although Klaus is still a fresh tennis pensioner, many of his actions suggest that mental processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, here's what we have here.
The head of the state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks what it looks like and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is now no threat to the external threat of the Republic.
Or maybe it's threatening, but it's not visible.
Then the question is whether it is exceptionally not (historically) good that the President is not entirely in power.
It's not normal.
Can't we elect a president in this country once again someone who's mentally and emotionally healthy?
Remote planets, black and white movies or a little fantasy about extraterrestrial life on earth are not the subjects that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would pitch to the icy.
In the concept of his quartet, which ends this year's Struny Autumn Festival in Prague's Grand Hall on November 6th, everything is related to everything.
Wayne Shorter's jazz saxophone quartet is the momentary feeling of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations of younger colleagues have to play what they are experiencing.
They approach music as totally improvised chamber matters and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film paintings.
This principle, however, is a fresh 80-year-old Shorter - an exceptional composer, the carrier of nine Grammys, former player Miles Davis and today perhaps the biggest living jazz saxophone player - he is reluctant to explain.
He does not talk too much about music, although his overall view of life with music is closely related.
At the age of 80, I came to the conclusion that it is best to let life be a surprise.
"Too many people plan everything and then they're disappointed when things turn out differently," Shorter says.
How the Insects From Thailand Raised the Markets of the Paris Bar
You may feel ugly about the insect, but you have no idea that you will eat it completely voluntarily for about half a kilo a year.
For example, groundnuts in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trends: it is ecological, nutritious and unique experience you also have taken care of.
He placed the insect first in Paris on his company's menu at the beginning of October Eli Daviron, the chef and owner of the Le Festin Nu Bar.
A bar whose name was inspired by William Burroughs' book Naked Lunch, you could find in the fashion 18th district near Montmartru by a large tourist.
With fresh avocados, baked red peppers, ginger and crispy eggs, the guests can taste not only different larvae, mares or water bugs, but also the aphids.
Carefully and specially packed deliveries (so that insects do not damage wings, do not crooked legs or hurt their eyes) Daviron is sent only from Thailand.
Europe is only learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of a Paris bar with a pioneering menu lists several reasons why insects should be consumed.
The first is environmental benefits, because insect production is much less costly for our planet (as far as finance, space and water consumption are concerned) than for traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, it makes the right restaurant a pleasure, a sense of sin and an atmosphere.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just facilitating a new experience," he explained.
Far from everyone would be thrilled to see how the bug is consumed with decorated pests, but the reactions of the customers of the Paris bar to the serviced insect are very positive according to the owner.
Even skeptics say they will eventually taste it, even if they start with the smallest scorpions and eventually choose a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Union of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic Václav Matáš: New Green Savings should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been facing a continuing decline in the volume of contracts and it is not interested in the state to address the issue of investment construction.
The launch of the New Green Savings programme has been a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in each region.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after the implementation of the measure, will raise considerable amounts for heating, but also opportunities for construction companies and producers of construction materials.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2,700 newly created jobs to the state.
From the point of view of fiscal policy, the state has significant leverage and multiplier effects, as well as one of the most significant growth measures.
Therefore, the Union of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic fundamentally disagrees with the government's resolution and requests that such steps be implemented that would allow the programme to continue further so that further challenges can be raised within the framework of it.
LEGISLATION, 1 November 2013
The dog sums up the carpet, the president kicks in, ends up with the crumbs.
President Miloš Zeman left the Motel Hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night in bed and went to a chateau in Lány.
What's his medical condition?
In an unprecedented confession John Kerry said that American espionage “has gone too far”
John Kerry suggested the US defense's position on his monitoring programs and in an unprecedented confession, he said that in some cases the espionage “has gone too far”.
The Foreign Minister has also admitted that he and Barack Obama are responsible for acting as a “autopilot” in view of the ferocious discovery of NSA espionage activities, which was made possible by informer Edward Snowden.
The published information sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Through a video link to an open-ended government conference in London, Mr Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, in the government, have actually learned about some of the things that have been done out of permanence, because the possibility was, with reference to World War II, a difficult period of cold war and then, of course, September 11th."
So he became the first high - ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had crossed the border, but he stressed that no one’s rights were violated.
He said: “In some cases it has gone too far. ”
And the President is determined to try to explain it to people and clarify it and is already conducting a thorough review to make sure that no one feels that abuse has occurred.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
However, Mr Kerry insisted that the NSA is striving for good and that its monitoring operations have saved many lives.
He added: “We are facing a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up. ”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill and blow people into the air and attack governments.
And what if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we prevented airplanes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being executed because we already know about these plans ahead.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday said that US lawmakers were preparing for Europe to respond to concerns from abroad about alleged American espionage and convinced Europeans that there was a need to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that this week the members of the European Parliament and other persons spoke and were worried about their threat of stopping participation in anti-terrorist organisations because they were disappointed by the monitoring of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the national security interests of the United States, it is indeed important that Europe remain with us on one ship, in view of a common effort to combat terrorism, said in a conversation from Washington Murphy, a member of the democratic party and the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations for European Affairs.
And I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism regardless of their anger over NSA programmes.
News in the media that NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe violated relations with some American allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States,
Another discovery cited documents by Snowden that the NSA tracked the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other up to 34 world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper was defending allied intelligence as necessary and said it was a common matter.
In the middle of the rumor Murphy said that his office is planning a parliamentary path that should take place this year and hopes that members of both sides and chambers will appear in the delegation.
The names of other legislators intending to engage are to be published the following days.
He said he's still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the goal of the trip was to help fix relations, he added that “the well-meaning educational measures ” would be ready.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people as regards the espionage programmes they have been using for years.
"While we are regulating our monitoring programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also realize that we are not the only ones conducting espionage here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is heading according to the plan for this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to respond to the hostility that has already been triggered by the American strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by American follow-up activities.
Aussie called off her stay in Thai prison.
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15-day imprisonment on the island of Phuket, who falsely claimed to have been attacked by a taxi driver, withdrew against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally accused by a civil court on the island of Phuket on 15 June by a false charge, when the Thai police said that the taxi driver and the two other men who allegedly detained her attacked her on Sunday, June 10.
However, the record from industrial television later revealed that after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend, she returned safely to her hotel.
Phuket Phuket police held interviews with Bamford for two days before she found out that she had made it up.
She was held in a local police cell before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low-priced correctional facility in Phuket, instead of being placed in prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who requested the assistance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra in the case of his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney’s Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had “extreme concerns” about the fate of its daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
"It is obviously a difficult time, but we hope that he will return safely to us as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed against the verdict and was released on bail of 50,000 Bahts.
Reports from Australia indicate that, in the meantime, she spent vacations in the holiday area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
According to the Thai legal authorities, Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that an appeal could lead to a trial that would increase her sentence and result in a placement in prison for adults.
However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand can also try to correct a mutilated picture for tourists, which may have just been behind the liberating verdict.
Jagger joked: goal of the breek?
He won a regiment in the defensive zone, and no one ever caught him again.
In addition, the leak changed after a quick forhend call.
Jaromír Jágr scored this against Tampa at night on Wednesday, on Thursday evening then 119. the winning goal in the NHL commented on the Facebook social network.
"After watching this video, my agent Peter Svobod heard from the director of the Czech Railways and asked him if I would not be interested in making an advertisement on their most modern train Pendolino!" he wrote in an introduction with an oversupply of Jagr.
I hear we're a lot alike.
I guess I'll just have to quit night practice so I don't get any faster.
"Because I'm afraid the Secretary of Defense might then call and he'd like to make a commercial for jets!" he added with smileys.
In addition, New Jersey signed the second victory in a row.
"And above all, you have noticed that Maria Rottrow is being treated," Jagr concluded.
Instead of the licence candle invitation stew
The October elections brought a bunch of losers before the winners.
These are not only parties that have not even reached the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and ultimately the ČSSD due to their internal rift.
We were served by politicians instead of the Christmas candles on weekends by a goulash.
The election jumper became Andrei Babish's movement, which promised the voters to change the current political style of government.
The resolution of the election outcome and the division on the winning side is recorded by the political (with) President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of voters, whom the party President Zeman publicly supported or elected to the House of Representatives.
Although the President lost his strategic edge over other policies because of an unpleasant event, he still has several ways to get it back - for example by choosing a future prime minister.
While the chances of obtaining the prime minister's chair in my eyes are moving away, the entrepreneurs of Andrej Babiš are approaching.
Although the election development is so far a mile away from the swift and smooth creation of a stable government, but compared to the left-wing government's election scenario of the CzechSSD-supported communists, this is a development for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy is a better report.
In view of the loud opposition YES to get together with ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely option of ČSSD, YES and KDU-ČSL (total 111 Members).
In view of the gap in ČSSD, which has thus become an innumerable and weak partner in the negotiations, the result of the coalition negotiations may be quite exclusivity for ČSSD.
The CzechSSD mineral government, composed of "non-terrestrials" in the castle, is probably not going to work.
In addition, any government in which the CzechSSD will participate will be threatened by the unmet ambitions of many Social Democrats, which can lead to a later division in the side.
So I'm asking myself, "Are we not going to make any more early elections?"
The next election would have been more like a referendum on the strength of the voting mandate of the YES movement.
The plans of the ČSSD for the introduction of sectoral taxes, a significant increase in income tax or the construction of the state bank, are hoped to fall under the table.
On the other hand, the ČSSD, YES, KDU-ČSL and Świat are compatible with, for example, business support, a variable fiscal policy (a government deficit below 3% of GDP), to support the employment of disadvantaged persons, a lower VAT rate on selected goods.
The third largest areas occur in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
Yes, but now it's on top, so the program is currently the most likely coalition YES, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would rather be on the right.
Which from my point of view is finally a better result than a left-hand program with taxes on everything that's still moving in the economy.
