India also looks forward to an agreement on defence cooperation between the two States, reportedly.
FANO Russia to hold the final Expert Session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO Russia) will hold the third Expert Session “Assessing the effectiveness of scientific organizations” in conjunction with RAN.
The Assembly will be the final in a series of meetings held by the Agency during the year, reported in a press release in Lenta.Ro.
At the third meeting, it is planned to take stock of the work of the Expert Session for the year and to establish a final list of indicators for the evaluation of the performance of scientific organizations.
Individual participants plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of scientific groups and criteria for the conduct of evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event in the course of the development of a unified approach for all three academies to the evaluation of the performance of scientific organizations.
We have been able to do so over the past five months, and the final version of the regulations is in agreement.
As a result of the next session, we must complete the process of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the evaluation," said the head of the expert and analytical office of FANO, Elena Aksenova, Russia.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than one hundred Russian scientific institutes.
It is expected that the resolution will be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow Time on 16 September 2014 at the following address: Moscow City, Soljanka Street, House 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect family stars.
Astrophysicists at the University of California in Santa Cruz studied the turbulence and its effect on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow for the search of relatives, or clusters, among the stars.
The authors published the results of their studies in Nature magazine and are available briefly on the university website.
The same chemical composition of nearby stars is caused by turbulence in the clouds of gas preceding the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can identify the birthplace and the formation region of the native stars.
Scientists had previously doubted that the evolution of a star outside a cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
Modelling results by astrophysicists show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, supercomputer experts modeled two streams of interstellar gas, which together formed a cloud.
This object has been transformed into a cluster in which prosthetics begin to form for several million years under its own gravity.
Scientists have added paint marks to the initial gas flow and found that rapid turbulence in the cloud results in a high degree of chemical homogeneity.
According to astrophysicists, their research proves that chemical stars can be found and that they can be identified as possible regions of the formation of such objects.
Carrata police arrested 20 years after high-speed motorcycle pursuit
The motorcycle was confiscated after being driven at a speed of 125 km/h in a 70 km/h speed limit and through the bushland to hide from the Pilbar police.
Carrata's transport patrol tried to stop the blue motorcycle this morning, finding its speed to be 125 km/h when it left the service station at Batgeit Road.
The police report that the motorcyclist did not stop and continue to move to Burgess Road, and then dropped into the bushland, causing the police to lose sight of him.
The motorcycle and the driver’s description were seen near the home of Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
Carrata police charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and dangerous driving.
He must be brought before the Peace Court of Carrata on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.

Lavrov: Russia will not become a door slam for new sanctions and will not withdraw from WTO
Russia will not be slamming the door with new sanctions.
This was said today by Chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov, speaking to the students and teachers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On the basis of our response to the new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasize, because everything has to be calculated,” he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will like this time, then we will decide how to respond.
This will not be linked to slapping doors, any insults that are misunderstood, - the Minister stressed.
First of all, we will move away from our interests, our interests to protect our economy, our social sphere, our citizens, our business, and we will draw conclusions from the actions of the partners on their adequacy, capacity and reliability.
On the steps taken in the area of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what partners are seeking, as continued by the head of the IMF.
If they all say that "these sanctions will also be painful for us, but we have to go there to punish Russia," that's probably not adequate."
With regard to the WTO, no exit of the RF in response to possible new sanctions.
On the contrary, we want to be more actively involved in the WTO instruments, including when it comes to trade disputes, Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome what we believe is a discriminatory EU policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia is being charged with dumping and is being subject to anti-dumping measures against the economy of the RF.
“We are ready to use WTO mechanisms and to advocate our position on the inadmissibility of applying the EU third energy package retrospectly,” Lavrov said.
How is it appropriate to use cheese in garden design?
The questions are answered by Irina Okunev:
Since the mermaid loses its main appeal after her abrasion, it is desirable to plant it together with other artisans.
It combines beautifully with many cultures.
In addition, we can and should plant plants that are decorative at different times and that are also colourful at the same time.
Another plus sirens is that it provides a mass of creative opportunities.
You can form it with a stem of various heights, an improved bush, a broad - ground bush, and even a garden bonsa — a tree with a beautifully curved trunk.
Just select the shape that is more consistent with the design of your garden.
In Kareliya, a Leningrad resident is convicted of the sale of counterfeit money
As reported in the Republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was involved in his criminal fishing activities in Olonetsk and Segegje.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused had already succeeded in succeeding in Vologodska oblast, where he was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment this spring.
Later, the man was brought before the Olonec District Court.
And to end the investigation into the crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in Segeja.
In the course of the investigation, there was evidence of guilt over several episodes of counterfeit money trading related to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, criminal proceedings with indictments were brought before a court.
On Friday, 29 August, the court decided to replace the four-year term of imprisonment with that of the general regime.
The sentence did not enter into legal effect.
Remember, last week there were two other smugglers who paid for them in Petrozawadska’s shops.
The citizens of Azerbaijan also came to Kareliya from St. Petersburg.
One is deprived of liberty for five years, the other is four years.
A fine of 500,000 rubles has been given to each.
The sentence has also not yet entered into force.
In Archangelsk, the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of Dervis First Convoy
The rally, held at the district center, focused on the first Arctic convoy.
Dervis provided military assistance from the United States and Britain to the USSR.
At the Archangel Memorial, the future monument to northern convoys, located on the coastal name of Sedova in Solombala, was held at the pawnstone.
The event was attended by representatives of the veteran organizations of Archangelia, children of the cadet class.
For the first time, we gathered twenty - three years ago when the foundation stone was laid.
But at the same time, today is not a celebration, but a day to remember those who did not return to the sea," said the chairman of the North Sea Navigation Board, Boris Karpov.
The event was followed by a city spirit orchestra, and cadet class teachers gave flowers to veterans and marched with the flags of Russia and the flag of Victory.
The rally ended with the flowering of the pawned stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of formal boots, lead, hair and many other inventory and equipment).
In addition, military equipment and weapons were on board, 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Harricain fighter aircraft, in a derecognitional state.
At the same time, the escort was made up of 16 British Navy ships, including two aircraft carriers.
The caravan was not discovered by the enemy and well reached its destination - Archangel.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 were killed and about 50 were killed.

Recalling the very American idea that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Allison and John Lewis proposed a bill on which trade union organizations are protected as civil law.
“Where trade unions are, there are middle-class jobs,” says Allison, a Minnesota Democrat who co-chairs the Congress of the Progressive Faction.
That is why I am proud to present the Act on the Promotion of the Rights of Workers, together with the symbol of the Civil Rights Movement, John Lewis.
This innovative bill will give workers the same legal opportunity to discriminate against trade union organizations as in other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of trade union opponents
The amendment of the Labour Regulation Act in such a way as to allow workers facing discrimination for participation in trade unions to seek justice in civil courts and to receive compensation for damages and fines is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative, at least under American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis and the co-sponsors of the bill are to think of a very American thought.
Despite the attacks that trade unions have suffered in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states around the country, Americans have once supported countries around the world in adopting, expanding and respecting labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans would still remember when the country was protecting democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his associates helped the country adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Todzo's paramilitary autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions are playing a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included a text that directly recognized that “the right of workers to organize and to negotiate and to collective action is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight Eisenhower and his associates helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler's Fascism had been replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that explicitly stated: “The right to form associations to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will not have legal effect; measures aimed at these purposes will be declared illegal.
When the former First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, was chairman of the International Human Rights Commission, which produced the World Declaration on Human Rights, which will be adopted in 1948 by the United Nations Organization as a global agreement, Roosevelt and drafters included the assurance that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect his or her interests”.
Throughout the generations, Americans have adopted as a proper basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and that the trade union should be protected as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government institutions.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is wise to return to the American idea that working people should have the right to organize and that their voices should be heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the power of the nation, but increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions have miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how it should be for us.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the increased protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - has long been ripe.
Keith Allison and John Lewis are restoring the ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
A judge temporarily blocks a law that could shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, a federal judge temporarily blocked the introduction of the Louisiana law on Sunday, which his supporters say would likely close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed to be carried out by the Governor of Louisiana, Bobbi Jinadl, in June, and was due to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who had abortions would be required to have the authority to admit patients to a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions by continuing to seek such powers.
“The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while continuing to take office”, Judge John deGrewells wrote in his decision.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month during which the judge will make a more permanent decision on the law.
The defenders of the right to abortion were happy to meet this decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital powers.
“Today’s decision guarantees that Louisiana women will be protected from an fraudulent law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Northap, President and Head of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who filed a motion to halt the law from three out of five state clinics.
It was not immediately apparent whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who had not acted as plaintiffs in the case and also applied for admission.
Louisiana belongs to 11 states that have passed such laws, and the courts have recently found such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
The right to abortion advocates, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that laws on admissions impose restrictions on doctors that are not necessary in terms of medicine.
Opponents object that such measures are intended to protect women ' s health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who has abortions in Louisiana has the authority to receive hospital admissions, the Centre for Reproductive Rights reported.
If all other doctors in the state were to cease the procedure, the team reported to the group, fearing for their safety.
Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish abortion doctors while their applications for decision-making were pending.
The introduction of quotas for domestic products will lead to
At least half of the products for each product type in the range of trading networks should be Russian production, according to the representative of the State from the faction “Just Russia” Oleg Nilov.
The Parliament has drafted a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, writes the newspaper "Investment".
The document will be further detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
For the rest of the product groups that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its fields to the domestic producers", said Neil.
Together with the amendments to the article on the basis of the State regulation of trade activities in the FP, the Bill provides for a revision of the Tax Code, setting a reduced VAT rate of 10 per cent in the implementation of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in commercial networks is included in a package of incentives for Russian producers.
There will be several times as many domestic products in the trailers.
However, the initiative may have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.
According to the lawyer, Nalogvik, a member of the independent expert centre, Social Duma, Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, will be positive and will lead to growth.
Plus, farmers, farmers, small stores.
They can sell more, which means the profits will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices to their creditors, as they will have to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, leading to higher taxes than before.
This will increase the revenue of the budget, create new jobs, some industries will start expanding, sooner and later, and contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decline several times, not immediately," the expert notes.
Earlier, Russian businesses had not been able to break into local stores because of the high competition from foreign analogues.
Now that the embargo has been imposed, this niche has been released and can be breathed with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will be sent to the Russian market after all the necessary reconciliations and sanitation checks.
In other words, the moment of silence has come when the former players have left and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, an increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products, was discussed by Aif.ru, the first Vice-President of the Russian Social Organization, “Russian Financial Directors Club”, according to Tamara Kasyanov.
Of course, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category would secure the sector for local producers.
In such a case, they would compete with each other rather than with goods that would be cheaper on the basis of subsidies from another State.
In other words, the fight for the buyer will take place between companies operating under the single laws of the industry.
On the other hand, notes Cassanova, Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of compatriots far from all articles.
In this situation, trade networks will have to “touch” the proportion of Russian goods up to half of the range.
There is a growing fear that defective goods will be placed on the docks.
Perhaps foreign products with broken labels will be placed in Russia," the expert adds.
Large trading networks, especially those that are more beneficial in cooperating with importers, have a negative impact on the introduction of quotas.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will be affected by this timetable, as demand for their products will decline.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas for domestic goods can affect consumers as well.
It is true that some Russian products may be of quality to import analogues, while shops can trigger prices for the second one, such as for low-cost goods.
The import idea of economists was again forgotten in the early 2000s because of the continuing devaluation of the ruble in February this year.
The issue of non-importing is becoming even more relevant in the light of the difficult relations with the West.
The Act is intended to oblige suppliers to be regarded as domestic producers in the form of orders.
Then we will move much faster and more confidently on the import path, and the production planning system for the required products will be established within a shorter time frame," said MEP Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where capacity is particularly high, for example in the dairy sector where the import rate was 25%.
Our farmers are actually able to completely cover the stalls of Russian shops.
In addition, a strong impulse can be obtained from meat production.
As is known, the largest import rate is maintained in beef, from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
It turns out that 65-70 per cent is still part of Russian products," Cassianov said.
Experts are of the view that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will facilitate and accelerate the import process.
However, this initiative will not lead in itself to import substitution, since it requires a set of measures, I am sure, Litvinenko.
In any event, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative could still be imported from abroad and thus full import would not take place, but significant steps would be taken in that direction.
Moreover, quotas need not be established and domestic production is still needed to meet those quotas.
The quotas are just such guarantees and will provide," the expert notes.
Untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovary cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of their deceased mother’s memory, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers analysed the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent lived five years after diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute of Medical Studies reported that the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher for those living in regions and remote areas of the state than for those living in urban areas.
CHALLENGE RESEARCH: New drugs may slow down lung cancer and ovarian cancer
Researchers tracked women's medical trail for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of women at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, current diseases and socioeconomic status also affected survival.
Women of older age and those who had a later stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote states, the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that the diagnosis was not timely and that access to optimal treatment was possible.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecology oncology, and they are mostly in large cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services in order to reduce the impact of distances, she suggested that an increase in the number of services that would allow professionals to treat women closer to home and that support programmes for people who went through treatment away from home might help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that the long life expectancy of women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquercancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Bank, Elisha Neve, was told that she had aggressive forms of ovarian cancer.
A new FAP will open doors in Kužener District in September
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaibeljak began in April this year and was carried out on a model project.
The cost of work was just over 10 million roubles.
According to the Public Relations and Information Office of the Head of Mary El, funding for the construction of the facility was provided through the Republic budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the treatment facility is almost 230 square metres.
There will be medical assistance for the inhabitants of eight settlements: the villages of Toktaibeljak and the villages of Dementijevo, Punchumal, Tunya, Fomici, Toraibeljak, Shinur and Chaskal.
The new Feldshire obstetric post will replace the existing FAA, which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources and its facilities do not meet the sanitary requirements.
The new institution will be opened soon.
The killer of a four-month-old son in a state of incoherence will be brought to justice
The resident of the Chushii will be at the bench of the defendants for the murder of his own child.
In Cheboksara, a criminal investigation into 31-year-old Novocheboxarsk resident, accused of reckless death, was completed.
The investigation found that on 26 July this year, the accused, along with his four-month-old son, came to celebrate the birth of her godfather's child in Cheboxara.
After a long stalemate, the rookie decided to stay in the house and put the baby to bed.
When the baby woke up at night and wept, the impertinent woman put him next to her on the bed to feed her breast, but soon she fell asleep.
During her sleep, the woman attacked her son, causing him to die of strangulation.
The criminal case is reported by the SCR Press Service of the Hearers sent to the court.
Inflation's out of vacation.
How do the Russians feel about the sharp rise in prices?
As a result of the cross-cutting sanctions, inflation in Russia will accelerate and fail to meet the expectations of the authorities, convinced by WTB Capital analysts.
According to experts, the delayed effects of anti-sanctions would lead to inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, according to RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast, inflation will be 6.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent in 2014 and 6.5 per cent less next year.
However, according to the Commersanta newspaper, this week the MEE should make “small but fundamental” adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast by 2017.
According to the publication, the department can lower inflation estimates for 2015, thus eliminating the expected resurgence of population income.
It was estimated that the food sanctions of the RF were in force one year before August 2015.
How could such inflation be assumed in such a situation?
The current situation is a shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change," said a newspaper in Minfin.
WTB Capital economists do not share government inflation expectations and forecast an 8 per cent price increase in 2014.
The main effect of the product bans will be the possible introduction of the sales tax (SSP) (in 2015) in the RF regions, as convinced by experts.
Inflation peak of 9 per cent will take place on February, followed by annual price increases, experts believe.
By the way, last week, Rosstat filed the first inflationary results after the RF imposed "cut-off sanctions".
Aif.ru interviewed the experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of Analysis Department of FC AForex:
Price growth is already taking place in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially significant products were valued, the Government had to initiate measures to systematically monitor price stability in order to prevent the risk of unjustified price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers already report daily to regulators so that authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason, initiates price increases.
The growth of the consumer price index continues to be a key factor in the enormous flow of capital, the over-refinance of the banking sector by the Russian Mega Regulator, the internal conversion due to the loss of population to foreign currency, and the embargo on imports of food products from countries that have acceded to sanctions against Russia.
If inflation pressure were to remain under control, the value of the minimum batch of products would not have jumped by 12 per cent in one quarter alone.
The ban on imports of food products caused a shock to the supply in the internal market and led to a perfectly logical increase in the final value.
As we fail to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution at the current stage, as well as to improve the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, sanctions will continue to pose risks to inflationary growth.
If fiscal reasons related to lack of confidence in national currency as well as the deteriorating prospects for economic growth are added here, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Alexander Razawayev, Director of Alpari Analytical Department
In the 1990s inflation sometimes reached 20-30 per cent per month, in the zeros it was also above the current level, in another case, which was compensated by rapid economic growth.
As a result of the year, I think inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Platon Maguta, Managing the Assets of the Maguta Foundation
An external factor related to sanctions against Russia has been successfully contained, but if pressure continues to increase, first of all, to the financial sector, it can lead to some difficulties and increase the population's inflation expectations, which are traditionally reflected in cash purchases to secure their savings.
It may be assumed that the Government, the CB of the RF and the Ministry of Finance will seek to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by public regulation.
But the price rises have traditionally begun after summer comfort and may become more tangible this autumn.
The consumer inflation target in Russia is likely to stand at 7.5 per cent, as the RF still has financial savings.
Gardening centres are saddened by the decline in the number of homeowners
This decline, due to an exceptional decline in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, could lead to the loss of tens of millions of pounds a year by today's young consumers of the “core age of gardening”, according to a HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to the report, people who rent homes spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that owners spend on gardening.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of gardening in front of a parking house, and the reduction of garden size as other threats to the industry, the annual sales of which are estimated at £5 billion.
In Great London, where the number of homeowners dropped from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, Britain’s lowest level of freight for gardeners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in the last six years.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society reported that renting housing and lack of garden space did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief plant consultant at the RHS, said, “The growing of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can transport plants when they move.”
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “golden century” of retail trade in gardening goods as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April of last year.
Bulgaria's Ministry of Agriculture carried out mass cleaning at the Earth Agriculture Foundation
Three of the four Heads of the Earth Agriculture Foundation were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four Heads of the Agricultural Fund were replaced on Friday.
Bulgaria's official Ministry of Agriculture only reported removal from the post of Executive Director, Atanas Dobrev.
Logan Vasileva took his place.
On Friday, two of the three Deputy Executive Directors of the Fund were changed.
Deputy Executive Director Tatyjan Angelov, who has been in charge of State aid and SAPARD so far, has been released, reports BGNES with reference to the Trod newspaper.
I did not attend the fund management board because we are not members of the management by law, but I was informed later that I had been released.
I can't tell you why my dismissal isn't reported on the Foundation's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I know more on Monday," Angel's publication said.
Its seat will be Ivanka Bagdatov, who has so far been the head of Investment Loan at the central fund in the Sofia Landbuilding.

Turkey calls upon US diplomat to report on espionage
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey has set up the country's highest-ranking American diplomat for clarification in connection with the report on US and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent reported that the US case officer and Turkish officials had discussed the communication on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and Internet Journal The Intercept reported that documents provided by former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a priority target for intelligence for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has reduced the importance of this communication, said that all leading countries are spying on each other.
The previously reported information that the main intelligence agency of Germany also made Ankara an intelligence facility has caused a more angry response to the Turkish Government.
Greatest Chinese companies against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China's largest real estate developer, Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (socsets, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese prospector), are creating a company that will compete in the online trade market with Alibaba.
But catching up with the miracle of Chinese Internet, which left even its American rivals eBay and Amazon.com behind, will not be easy.
Union of the Largest
Companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan in a joint venture ($814 million), 70 per cent will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent to each of the Internet companies, according to Wanda Group.
The company is scheduled to be registered in Hong Kong.
The JP will combine Baidu search services with the popular WeChat social platform (the largest social network in China, with some 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda's infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 attractive hotels, the Wanda Group manages at least 49 commercial real estate facilities throughout China and 40 shopping centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion Yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a cinema and entertainment theme park in Cindao (town in eastern China on the banks of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and to make a profit at $960 million.
Besides, Wanda owns the American AMC Entertainment Holdings Cinematographers' network, which makes the company the world's largest movie theater operator.
By 2015, Wanda plans to provide all its shopping centres, hotels and places of entertainment with e-commerce services, which will be developed by the very competitive Alibaba.
According to Dun Tse, who will lead the new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new site should become the largest online-to-offline platform in the world, notes Dun Tse.
Online-to-offline (O2O) commerce consists of attracting buyers on the Internet to come to regular offline stores or to buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is the coupon sales services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest pie in online commerce," said the head of Wanda Van Jianglin (Bloomberg quote).
“Now there is no current O2O site in China, and in this situation the chances of all are roughly equal”, he said.
China's Internet Trade Market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates it will increase more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011 to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 million, resulting in official statistics: they are more of the population of every country in the world, except India.
And it is projected that by 2015 this number can grow to 850 million.
Union of the Rich
Tencent Ma Huaten until recently was China's richest man, but according to the Bloomberg Millionaires Index, the founder of Alibaba Jack Ma has already crippled him for $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's condition is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion comes to his share of Alibaba.
Baidu Robin Li is now third among China's richest people, while Wang Jianglin from Wanda is fourth in line.
“It’s very interesting to see this battle: three of the richest people combine their efforts to challenge an even richer one,” said Bloomberg, director of the Chinese Center for Electronic Commerce at Hanzhou Tsao Lai.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Alibaba as soon as it is created: "Rom cannot be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba is not simply competing with not only new companies but also deserving leaders of the world's Internet trade shows the Alibaba financial performance of the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as an average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, China's company earned more than both its US competitors combined.
Alibaba’s net profit over the period is almost twice the total of its competitors — it has grown almost threefold in annual terms and amounted to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has a huge potential for money generation, largely thanks to its mobile applications," Bloomberg commented.
According to the updated Alibaba prospectus on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission website, the number of active mobile users of the company ' s services in July amounted to 188 million, significantly exceeding the March figure (163 million).
However, 32.8 per cent of all transactions in Alibaba over the past quarter were made on mobile devices.
Alibaba should be named the value of its shares before IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the company can be estimated at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, the debut of Alibaba on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could already be held on 16 September.
Road show companies ahead of this event will start on September 3rd.
It is expected that Alibaba's output on IPO will become record in the history of NYSE and will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
So far, the US stock exchange record has been owned by the Visa payment system, which in 2008 made its primary share of $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in the trading networks should be Russian, according to the MEPs.
They have drafted a bill on this subject.
This includes the amendment of article 8 of the FZ on the basis of the State regulation of trade activities in the FP and the Tax Code.
The aim of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, should be made for at least 50 per cent of domestic products in stores for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruit in winter, so that they will be reduced to avoid any discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, setting a 10% lower VAT rate for all food products originating in Russia, reports the newspaper "Investment".
On 27 August, a draft law was introduced to the lower House of Parliament amending the Law on retail markets, which proposes to restore to Russia agricultural markets where small producers can implement their products.
Magaluf Police Chief is charged with corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and municipal officials at the Malorca State Attorney's office on Friday.
The Chief of Police of Calvia on the Malorca resort island was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at a scandalous centre of unbridled drunkenness of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of allegations of corruption brought against him by several businessmen from Punt Ballen, the street where most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to Mallorca Diario's daily online publication, the plaintiffs provided evidence of extortion by police and municipal officials at the Malorca Prosecutor's office to combat corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard for allegations of corruption and will be interrogated by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish daily edition of ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners said that protectionism on the part of the authorities had a serious impact on the state of their business.
“It’s no longer about making money, it’s about surviving,” one businessman told the court.
Our sources of existence cannot be jeopardized.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf got the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British rester who passed 24 men during a bar run.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to end the bullying of the restless Magaluf, minimizing the number of scandalous alcohol raids at bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where the mine incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and Carnage bar organizers were jointly fined for €55,000 ($73000).
The Mahaluf tourist resort, mainly popular among young British vacationers, was also a place of numerous drinking accidents, known as “balconing” when people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel basin.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and wind conditions affecting flights at Adelaide Airport
WESNA prepared a cold surprise in South Australia, bringing torrential rains and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm rain fell on the city at night by 9:00 p.m., followed by 6.6 mm, which fell out on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a pair of short rains with a stormy wind, including a storm that began not long before 8 p.m. and poured out almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter gave out the early spring last week, the temperature dropped again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
The quality conditions are supposed to have served as one of the reasons for the delay in landing the Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land immediately after 7:30 p.m., but it reached the wind shift zone, a sudden change in speed or direction of the wind at a short distance, and was forced to gain altitude.
Wind surges reached 50 km/h on land at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to be raised during the second landing, and the plane finally landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay caused the delay of several other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected at Adelaide on Tuesday with the probability of one or two leva.
Calculation of construction in the RF will take place in a new way
Price-based issues, construction regulation, and networking issues The Federal Anti-monopoly Service has taken special control.
The FAS has established an expert council for building competition.
At its meeting, the head of the management of the control of the JCC, the construction and natural resources of the FAS Vadim Soloviev stated that “the current calculation of the construction facility estimates is totally incomprehensible”.
The normative base makes pricing opaque and may lead to an unjustified construction price, according to FAS.
And they offer the cost of building the property at the design stage to determine, on the basis of market prices, constructive solutions instead of the current estimated standards and unit costs for technological operations.
These proposals have been made in the road map and are now under consideration in the Ministry.
“The replacement of traditional estimated construction documentation for the construction of constructive elements should result in less corruption in the industry,” explained Vadim Soloviev, “WGB”.
After all, every bolt and nut is now accounted for, and it is not always possible to verify everything, so sometimes in the documentation, unfaithful construction companies can bury “whole tractors”.
The FAS Minister agrees.
“The first development of cost conversion for constructive elements is already in place: methodologies have been developed to calculate prices for constructive solutions, to calculate estimates for these indicators,” said the head of the Department of Urban Activities and the architecture of the Minister, Elena Zhukov.
The field of road construction has been selected as pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
According to the head of the Profi-invest construction company Anatoly Demianko, the estimated standards have long been outdated, but no other mechanism has yet been proposed for business.
“What is involved in the proposed calculation of constructive elements is, in practice, difficult to implement, as buildings often use very different technologies,” he said.
It's no secret that the structure is developing in many ways thanks to the decree.
In the view of Ekaterina Lezina, Chairman of the NP Board of Experts, the State is the most capable of paying.
Deputy Director for Engineering of the Rozatoma Capital Construction Sectoral Centre Vladimir Malakhov pointed out that the market is now conditionally divided into companies with access to the portfolio of contracts and companies with monopolistic competences and which do not allow competitors to do so.
It considers that the creation of a transparent market is only possible if access to contracts is as limited as possible as possible from someone in charge.
On the expert board, it was suggested that a system should be established so that the same contractor could not receive more than one contract of more than 1 billion rubles or several contracts of more than 1 billion rubes.
The Minister believes that this approach should be assessed in terms of the impact on business and the efficiency of construction management.
As Elena Zhukova explained, the functions of the general contractor would have to be assigned to the contracting authority, which would increase the number and budget of the contracting authority.
In doing so, the contracting authority will have the knowledge to assess the quality and safety of the works performed by the contracting organizations.
Often, such a breakdown will need to determine who will be responsible for the security of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may lead to the outflow of highly qualified members of the Government because of the lack of interest in obtaining a government order for part-time work and a small amount of contract.
The head of the expert advisory centre of the Institute of Procurement, Alexander Evstaschenkov, believes that the procedure for the ban has now become a business play for the care of the contractor.
The following example was cited: “When the application is completed, the participant should indicate “specific indicators” without the words “or equivalent”, “must be”, “of”, “more”, “less”, “alog”, “or”, “type”, “not lower”, “less”, “more”, “may be”, “may be”, “may be”, “not earlier”, “not earlier”, “not above”, “not above”, “not permitted”, and so on.
Customers thus often abuse their right to set requirements for the content of an application submitted by contracting organizations.
Another 44-FZ problem, according to Evstaschenkova, was the need to assess the quality of work at the application stage through the “paper” proposal of the participant.
In considering the application, it is only possible to assess the qualifications of the contractor, but not the quality of the work that has not yet been carried out, the expert believes.
The quality of the works can only be assessed by accepting them.
The expert board was also requested to transfer the marginal income from the upper to the lower echelon in order to disappear intermediate contractors.
The Chairman of the Expert Board, the State Secretary, the Fass Secretary, Andrey Czarikovsky, believes that this is not worth doing, as a general contractor must be responsible for the order.
Or else, as Arkady Rikin's famous rerun, "Athelle" says, "Is there a claim to the buttons?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, when missiles and mines rained on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed as the Territory recovered after the fighting.
The start of schooling brought a sense of joy and excitement to the missile-stricken settlements of southern Israel, but the traces of hostilities remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the Pashosh children's garden, which had been hit by a rocket, had removed the marks of the shards from the walls and bitter children before the disciples arrived.
"We are a little afraid, but we are happy to look to the future," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibutz Saad, and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to get back to life in size.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said she was about to start going back to school "a little weird."
"It's been a difficult time, and we haven't left our homes at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the ceasefire stopped the war last week, thousands of people in border settlements, such as Saad, did not go out or leave their homes, moving to safer areas beyond the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many Nahal Oz residents, settlements not far from the Gaza border, where a four-year-old boy was killed by a fragment of Palestinian mine, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderota, a city on the border with Gaza, which had grown very old by the Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study hard and said, "We will do our utmost to give you knowledge and to ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The cease-fire agreement immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as the Hamas demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down his weapons and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
The new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of the killed were militants; nevertheless, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gazan fighters fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip were damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 250,000 people were found safe in more than 100 schools that were converted into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and fighting continued, education officials delayed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon open so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammed Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in a Gazan school.
According to the popular criteria for real estate prices, the winter’s largest growth was seven years.
The housing value index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 per cent in August, according to the RP data on Monday.
This increase resulted in a combined increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than twice the increase of 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Data Director Tim Lawles reported that Sydney and Melbourne run a two-level market.
RP Data shows that in Sydney housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in the last year, while in Melbourne they rose by 11.7 per cent.
The next market power was Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices on average rose from 5 per cent to 6 per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which was followed by government spending cuts, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per annum.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of real estates displayed for sale in the next few months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“According to the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high selling speed and the current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that the cost of housing will continue to increase over the next three months”, he said.
How People Live in the Old House of Ufa
In the former house of goldsmiths and miners Eudocim and his son, Ivan Demidov, on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (formerly Grand Kazanski) 18 apartments.
The 18th - century house has remained virtually unchanged since its construction.
Foreigners go on a tour here, and the lodgers suffer more than they're happy to, from their privilege, the right to live in the older Ufim house, whose walls are remembered by Alexander Suvorov's general.
The date of construction of the house is incorrect, historians indicate two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But anyway, it turns out that the building is 300 years old.
Old yard, always open, screeching stairs.
The doors in the apartment are close to each other, the walls are shaking, and the corners are visible in the area.
I think it's all on the up-and-up.
And the locals say, "You don't think so."
Living in a wooden house of the 18th century is very difficult, says Tatiana Lukyanov, resident of apartment No. 3.
The facility is in the public area, but the money for its maintenance has not been allocated for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that have been forgotten by the authorities.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still thin and poor, but the foundations are rotten.
Many tenants still go to the bathroom on the street and wash once a week in a public bathroom.
How can we be content under such circumstances?
The road goes right under the windows, not even the pedestrian zone.
Tatiana's pushing the curtain.
You can now see what was said before: Under the windows, there is a flow of cars.
You see, the glass is constantly grinding, the windows can't open, and the noise is getting used to.
But man is accustomed to all things, good and bad.
Our apartment is still model, thank you husband, his hands are gold.
In fact, we have two rooms, we live with our son.
In other families, conditions are much worse, on the second floor the ceilings are a little over one and a half feet high.
For the contrast of Tatyana, she offers to visit a neighbor from apartment No. 6 of Ludmila Starostina.
A pleasant hospitable woman on the doorstep offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live with our granddaughter and my husband.
I've been here since birth, and there's never been another place, and Ludmila's eyes are around the room: Antresoles, two couches with a "g" on one of them, one of them has a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very close and very little different from the ordinary native interior: only ceilings beautiful, “historic”.
But from the ceiling, it flows regularly: the plumbing system is useless.
Ludmila speaks of her apartment as ordinary and as surprising as an Italian woman whose home is in Roman ruins.
So it's very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The water supply was carried out some 40 years ago during the last renovation.
Then they made us a small kitchen in a corner and a toilet from the former chalon.
We live right where Demidov and his family lived on the second floor.
Our apartment isn't privatized, and why?
Ufa's Real Estate Centre says privatization is irrelevant.
We still get a one-bedroom apartment, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, we were promised to be resettled, but no further promises were made.
I'm not used to complaining or complaining.
In this apartment (room!) there was a dynasty: my grandparents, my mom and dad, my husband and my daughter with my granddaughter.
It's been a while.
For example, healthy rats ran through the kitchen.
Look at the flags, they're metro thickness!
They say the solution was mixed on eggs, so it's been holding on for so long.
The house is well built, thank you to the Demids!
Maybe that's why it didn't kill anyone with a thong or a tie.
Only the building is still slowly dying in front of us: the boards and logs of the house rot, the fields have failed on many occasions, we have poured cement, but everything is useless - the solution enters the ground like a well.
They say it is, under our room, a secret lasa and the passage to the river Bela, which was specifically made by those who once lived here old-fashioned so that there could be no danger, for what.
But they were persecuted.
Ludmila Starostin tells how a historian came to see them, begged him to start digging up the apartment.
And then I convinced them to give them the encampment in exchange for their singles on the October prospectus.
Sophia said to the historian:
Where are we four in one?
And there's even a little hope here that they'll give more space.
We agreed to trade, we wouldn't win anything anymore.
After all, the Seniors' family didn't win anything.
Ludmila's greatest dream was to be resettled, and her daughter was given a separate room with a 16-year-old granddaughter.
That is, two families have set up a two-bedroom apartment instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations now live.
A cute, miniature girl named Olesia Karsakova from apartment Nos. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There is a large family living in two narrow rooms with a total area of 23 m2 called apartments.
There are seven of us, two of us.
You can see the conditions.
The plaster falls off with pieces, like window frames, in the kitchen walls and in the rooms through sliding holes.
The water in the tap is only cold for a year.
Walking through the apartments of the old house of Ufa, you can be sure that most of them are lucky to have Lawrence's wives from apartment number four.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
A room of 75 square metres is prescribed by three persons.
We live right in those rooms where the legend of Suvorov stopped during his stay in Ufa, says the head of the family Alexander Dmitryevich Lavrentyev.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One bad thing is, everybody's kicking around the seams, falling apart, moving.
The neighbors must have already told you!
The most torture we have with the floor: wooden boards rotted, the ground literally went out from under our feet.
I've put up my heels, kid. There's nothing in the room yet, and in the other room, we walk like we're climbing, so hard.
The house of the buyer Evdocim Demidova, Alexander Dmitryevich, is better than any tour guide.
The goldsmith is considered a relative, and he is admiring.
Indeed, the identity was unmanaged: the master of the Kagina and Uzian factories built houses, poured out guns and bells, and held the Ural mines.
The heirs of purchase real estate are proud of their ancestors, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I settled here as a child in the 1940s, says Alexander Dmitryevich.
Then there were wooden quarters for carriages, stables, and wooden booths, which were later demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to take away our house, but something got in the way...
The story was repeated in 2014: new housing was again lagging behind.
As a team, we gathered all the documents, held the necessary authorities, and suddenly learned that moving to the apartment was moving to 2015 or 2016.
Something we don't believe in anymore...
Two years ago, Lawrence went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bascortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The tenants did not accept it.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a mockery, issued a paper without signature and stamp, "The Ministry of Culture has no objection to the resettlement of residents."
I even had this feeling that our house was long gone from city to city, because first it was under number 57, then it was 57 A, and now it's 57/1.
It's like he was taken down in the '70s.
The Russian Planet has addressed the information and analysis sector of Ufa Vladimir Barabashu's land administration.
A house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the settlement programme of the Vetho home.
I can't be held responsible for the actions of officials in the 1970s, but I know there was a plan to demolish all the old houses at the time, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the modern authorities to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, has been successfully implemented.
Residents are scheduled to be resettled soon.
According to Barabas, it will be the Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice to restore the Demidov House.
The architectural biennale is now under way in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire former Old Kazanska Street will be restored, says the official.
The home will be given the right kind, which conformed to the one before, three centuries ago.
The Demidova House is likely to be a museum open to all who wish.
In addition, at the government level, it was decided to make the street on the weekends on foot.
Unfortunately, waking up won't cause too much congestion in the city.
To resettle people from the future museum Vladimir Barabas promises in 2015.
After all, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Only from another era.
A forest fire started in Primorje due to the storm
The dry storm caused forest fire in the area of the hunting ground in the Fireplace of the Primorsk Region.
A group of forces and funds is being strengthened at the burning point.
According to the HCSC management, the “Primorsian Air Base” conditions created at the scene of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vassili Medvedev, Deputy Head of Air Base:
A fire in a hard-to-reach area was discovered by an observer on board an An-2 patrol aircraft at 3 hectares.
The wood residue on the old burner is burning.
The severe debris of the Territory and the steep slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable fire-place landings pose considerable challenges to the silence.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The delivery of forces at the airbase by an Mi-2 helicopter and an An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the fire was discovered, four firefighters were promptly discharged.
The main task of specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the site to supply additional firepower and fire extinguishers.
In the area of lunch, three firefighters were additionally delivered to the village of Hodwarts.
Once the helicopter landing site in the area of fire is ready, specialists will be transferred to the place of shower, reported to the Primorska Region Administration.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of the seven children born to an immigrant family from Jamaica in Dudley, Midlands, in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses a comedy called the Rare Plates of Rudy, which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from a series of broadcasts to Radio 4.
Soundtrek is a mixture of reggae and rap, and melodies are life-giving.
Henry, however, had to go through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother died, there was a lot of treatment, and Henry often thinks about his father's relationship with him.
He was very inaccessible.
You never saw his face, you just heard him say, "Stop crying.
Stay away from your sister.
Let's go!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, went to the pub with him and talked about things like a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket strike.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such an impudent guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a Lithuanian workshop in Dudley, and although conditions were better than his father’s day, he was able to see what his life must have been like.
It's a little bit better now, but it's dark, smokey, maze depths with fire and smoke and soot dogs.
My father got into the bathroom and he was just lying there, and you heard him slowly singing about himself because he wanted to wash himself away from the Lithuanian workshop.
When I got there, I realized that he had done it for years and years to earn us a living, and I appreciated him more.
Nevertheless, Henry left his childhood without parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
Only when my mom got sick at the very end of her life did we start saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he lacked when he was a child.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why wouldn't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, who he was married to for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why wouldn't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry himself had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very well corrected and had diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.
Then I started serious fitness classes, and I also had to take a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
Nobody eats carrots.
Henry's career trajectories change may be reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Since his admission of critics as his Otello, he has been in the theater completely.
Followed by "Media Errors," then August Wilson's "Forgets."
This work differs from the sitcoms and comedies, which were an integral attribute of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
D.J. noticed him parody on the stage and wrote about him in "New Faces."
His career on television began in the mid-70s: "I've been the only black parody/combe on television for quite a long time."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the audience, but I had to learn to be an effective car to deliver jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working on television, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in New Faces, 1975
Since his manager was entitled to a black and white minstrel show, a light entertainment program in which people “blacked their faces”, Henry discovered what was in it for five years.
My family really didn't like it.
I kind of wish it wasn't with me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, condemned position, I worked on large sites and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was “the prize awarded by easy entertainment classics on British television for years and years” was also a “grotesque parody on black people”.
In introducing the characters who were mocking and rehearsing the Black culture in Britain, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the '80s.
The first season of the show, Lenny Henry, was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s, it was known as, among other things, the Chief of the Cookery, Garrett Blacklock, of the show "Boss!".
The commercials, documentary films, TV shows and movie roles took him the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC show in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "What you're going to do next, Len, because it seems a little like you're pulling your time or quiet back."
There was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's Good At...?"
The first one was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
You can't say that I'm taught so much at school, and I thought it was actually the prerogative of the middle-class white people with the tights and the cappuccino at the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the transmission, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try it.
Don't mock it until you know what you're talking about.
Speak some of these words aloud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from the last Otello monologue for documentary transmission, and he was caught.
I felt like I could do it.
It's like my head's been fixed.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we put it up.
She was a success, too.
They seemed to be waiting for catastrophes, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started the bug comedy.
Suddenly I'm in the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his case was to entertain the audience.
"The silent voice inside me said, "You're going to have to work for 10 minutes while they're making a computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else take care of it.
"You play the play, stay in the play."
Henry in "Forgettings" at the Daches Theatre.
It was difficult to study the text for the "Locks".
Panic is very useful, it strengthens the muscle.
She was also well received, so it was like a sign above showing, "This is what you need to do."
He says this with a loud voice, of course.
So I'm holding on to this.
I really love it.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has the thought of a comedian, the whole way of our conversation is interrupted by the flashes of his humor, when he starts, it ends with parody.
I just decided not to work in a stand because this thing with instant pay from a full room of strangers, I think it's pretty dangerous.
If that's what you've been trying to do, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work at the Apollo Air Force when I want to, but mostly I don't get the pleasure I used to be.
I'm asking if he'll give the tour of the stand again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the road, I don't think I'll ever want to give it up.
So this is his new version?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice party.
You're always telling some story, and it's a great place to be.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers government officials to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya began the biometric registration of all government officials in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the Government ' s payment statement.
Staff members who are not registered for the next two weeks will no longer pay are reported in a government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyata promised to reduce corruption in public structures after it came to power in 2013.
Audit review earlier this year found that at least $1 million ($700000) per month was lost by “invisible workers” and other financial irregularities.
The Government suspects that salaries continue to be paid to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports BBC Vanyam Chebusiri of the capital, Nairobi.
All government officials must appear in the identification centres for the next two weeks to ensure that their data will be collected through biometric registration procedures is reported in a government statement.
Anyone who does not do so without a valid reason will be removed from the payment statement, it shall be reported.
“This procedure significantly facilitates the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clear the balance of payments at both levels of the Government, thus ending the problem of “invisible workers”, said Anne Weighur, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers for Planning and Structure of Power.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with the “conspiracy” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of a “conspiracy against the Government”, local information agencies reported.
The police did not comment immediately on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to a report by Harriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in activities to identify corruption in the past December, which was aimed at testing government staff, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of establishing an organized criminal group and listening to the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was the Prime Minister at the time) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by Islamic Cleric Fethullah Gulen.
Not All Children Return to School in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1st) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenius Yatzenuk has taken his daughter to school.
There he told expected journalists that not all schools had been reopened, but that he would do his utmost to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1st, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge and united Ukrainian people's front, must fight for the peaceful sky.
Alexan Pastuhov, director of the school in Slavjansk, where Yatsenuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that the children will receive the knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of school has traditionally been marked by children wearing embroidered shirts, holding air balloons in their hands, and giving flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead BBC, she may have found such an impressive leader as she needs.
It is followed by fame from the world of banking, media management and the interior of the Tori party.
In fact, it has its own experience in decision-making.
Her career began in a global management consulting firm called Bain and Co, and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearsons media world.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when Pearson's head of the company took a male colleague in a lower position.
They say her earnings are close to £1 million.
Its political ratings are also strong.
She was recommended by David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector professionals to Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former adviser to Torah.
Earlier in May, I called the work of the Chairman a poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of public life, but it has an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two pillars: inside as the top management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but outside as a voice of public concern and excitement when something is going wrong.
This is an almost elusive duopoly that needs full radical reform.
However, what new President would risk coming, fracking and destroying an institution as difficult as the Chinese dynasty if he deprived himself of his work in that process.
It's a difficult decision.
It would not be that difficult, many people would be pleased to see the BBC shrink in size, once its powers, finances and status have been revised.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge the cozy old habits, the inevitable negotiations on the cost of the licence pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest amount of £145,50 a year, the British acquire a share of the world's largest media enterprise.
The BBC tells a good story: it states that its work covers 96 per cent of households and stands at least 40 per cent per day.
Moreover, Beeb’s popularity is apparently growing: 53 per cent of the population today is supported by Beeb, as opposed to 31 per cent by 10 years ago.
Browse and use models of the BBC have changed: I now receive news headlines on my mobile phone and watch the missed programs on the iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive president, I hope she found him.
Perry of Texas says a humiliating tweet was written by someone outside
A tweet from the confirmed account of Governor Texas, Republican Rick Perry, on Sunday evening, contained an offensive image of the district prosecutor from the Democrats at the centre of prosecution for abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed and followed by another one from Perry's account, where the record was disassociated.
Just from my account a tweet was published that was written by someone outside.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I've removed it," a later note says.
Perry ' s assistants did not respond immediately to the reports requesting comment.
Although the records were loaded from the confirmed Perry account, it was unclear who was actually publishing in that tape.
The earlier tweet contained an obscene cartoon against the prosecutor of Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who found himself guilty of driving intoxication in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on funding her department when she refused to resign, which led to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential candidate for presidents in the 2016 elections.
"I don't always drive a car in a state of intoxication, three times the level of blood alcohol allowed, but when I do, I blame Governor Perry for what he tells me about it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg did not conduct a grand jury investigation against Perry.
Michael McCrume, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry did not plead guilty and charged himself with political harassment.
His powerful legal team had asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, stating that the law used to prosecute the Governor, who served longer than anyone in the history of Texas, would make it clear that it was contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding for $7.5 million from state funds for the State Department, which is based in Travis County and is pursuing corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
Veto made a formal complaint by a group of public control with left-handed views.
The tape of the confirmed Perry account is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
Upon attending the fifth meeting of the Iowa Party during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he could get out of the game by tweeting with a picture of himself running near the lake, and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market is back to normal
One of London's most famous builders warned that the real estate market in south-eastern England had returned to normal levels of activity.
Homes in the capital were subject to lively demand and rapidly rising prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble would push Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pijley, founder and chairman of Berkeley's elite construction company, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to its normal level of transaction since the peak of 2013”, adding that this has provided a “stable working environment”.
London’s real estate market succeeded during the fall, as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
City prices rose by 18.5 per cent over the past year alone, according to the Land Inventory, significantly overwhelming the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for private, accessible and student schemes in Berkeley rose by about one fifth last year, reaching £423,000 in late April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of which also halted the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around the potential “partner tax” before the general elections next May.
The London Real Estate Agency Foxtons warned last week that the April reform of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter lending conditions, would also result in a decrease in market growth both in real estate sales and in prices during the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, with a further cooling on the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its forecast of rising prices for London real estate for 2015 to 3 per cent on the basis that real estate prices have already begun to decline.
Transaction volumes in the meantime fell by a quarter compared to the previous year in the most expensive parts of London, such as Chelsea, Meyer and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the demand for homes in the capital has proved to be very beneficial for Berkeley by raising the sales volume of over £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pijley added, "The demand for goods with good design and a better location has remained unchanged and, reflecting this, sales have been retained for a period of time."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new houses this year before the end of April, almost a third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
Annual income prior to payment of taxes rose by 40 per cent from the previous year to £380 million, income by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
Following a statement Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pijley said that Berkeley's expected income for this year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to analysts, profits are expected throughout the year before taxes are paid to £450 million.
Berkeley's stock was worth £23.96 in the afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Photos of the naked Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence is attending the 85th annual award ceremony of the American Film Academy.
The photos of the naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscar Award, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who believes that he has a “catalogue” of another 100 rising stars.
The representative of the Star of the Hunger Games confirmed that the photographs of Lawrence were real, and condemned the hacker for “sudden invasion of personal space”.
Law enforcement authorities have been approached and they will prosecute anyone who publishes stolen photographs of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally presented on the 4chan photo exchange site were allegedly obtained by the lack of an online storage system for Apple iCloud, and the alleged “catalogue” of the victims of the break-in included dozens of female celebrities, including Ryan, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is unclear how many of these photographs are true, although the star "Scott Pilgrim vs. All" Winstead in Twitter also condemned the break-in.
"The one who's looking at the photos we took with her husband a few years ago, staying at home, I hope you're proud of yourself," Winstead wrote in Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's iCarly series and Victoria's Victoria-Victory argued that in her photos, she wrote in Twitter: "These are the so-called photos of the false image of me, the people.
Let me stop it in the bud.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the representative of the pop star, Ariana Grande, had denied that the photos on which it was supposed to be true.
An exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J", which praised critics
They were dissolved, preferably to say the exact same thing, and they were gradually falling apart, like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only sometimes did the woman tell him that he was too serious, too heavy to communicate, tense, closed, and maybe a little annoying.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw the irritability in him.
He was thorny like a hedgehog, yeah.
The last victim of this thorn was a little novel, from which he expected more than usual, deliverance from a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was shivering with fragile hairs and a trembling heart from the northern island village, even more distant and harsh than Port Royben.
She came south with her older partner, whom Kevern considered to be her aunt, the last one to inherit a house in a gray but like a paradise valley called the Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for a few years.
The pipes flowed, and the spiders sat motionlessly in the baths, and the mussels left their marks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; and the garden grew torns like giant cabbages.
It was like a catheter from a children's book, both frightening and charming, with a complete secret garden.
Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is included in Booker's Long List in 2014.
Short list to be announced next week
Keverne and Eileen were sitting, holding hands, in broken lounges among the tall grass, enjoying the sudden warm spring day; they were both distracted by the cheap console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news when they looked at her bent brown legs, he remembered an old song by an old black performer who loved listening to his father, leaving curtains in the house.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their aggression, songs of this type were no longer played on the console.
They weren't banned -- nothing was actually forbidden -- they just didn't lose them anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, just like the word "archaic."
Public taste was what would never have been achieved by orders and regulations, and just as among the books people chose memoirs of rich people who grew up in poverty, culinary books, and love novels, they chose ballads from all the music.
After enjoying that day, Kevern took on an imaginary piano and a rough comedy voice to sing Eileen’s big legs.
Eileen didn't get it.
"It was a popular song by a jazz piano player named Fats Waller," he told her, automatically attaching two fingers to her lips.
That's how his father always did it to stop the letter "J" before she landed off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was little.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start with a "J" when you forget to put two fingers in your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game back then, and it wasn't very fun right now.
He knew that's what they wanted him to do, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Eileen never heard of him.
Jazz wasn't played either, even though he wasn't openly banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the melody began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
That's exactly the same with the ostromia.
Its unpredictability has affected people's nerves.
And jazz was the wit of music.
Although he was 10 years old and had never heard of Sammy Davis Jr., he knew about jazz from his father's semisecret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
In view of her age, she could hardly remember the time when the popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
The society was obedient, which meant that each segment of it agreed with the gratitude of those who had been preserved by fate, the principle of group prejudice.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent, by temperament and physical characteristics, were well suited to entertainment and sports, and they sang and ran.
People from Indostan, as if they were talented in everything about electronics, went on to make sure that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was sanitary work; what was left of the Greek plate.
The exiles from the Persian Gulf and Levant, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country, when IT WAS the time when they were afraid of being accused of inflaming the flames, in fear that the flames would devour them, opened the restaurants with labs and hooks, and didn’t hang out and grieve for nothing.
Every one of them according to their abilities.
Since she had heard only ballads before, it was hard to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just spoken to her could have been put to music.
Music is the expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Or maybe it's for people with big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the running garden gave him an illusion of security.
Not one word could penetrate the soundproofing of giant leaves that looked like cabbage leaves.
Eileen still didn't understand.
How could your father love such a thing?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers in his mouth again.
She already thought it strange.
"He thought it was funny," he said instead.
She shook her head unbelievably, closing the Cavern review.
All over the world, there was nothing but a pile of her black-haired ass.
Nothing he'd like to look at.
"Well, if you say so," she said, staying in her opinion.
But that still doesn't explain why you're eating it to me.
She seemed really upset.
My legs are too big?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The ankles, maybe a little bit...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you just because you have thick ankles," he tried to say instead.
I'm having such a bad time.
That didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to fool him often brought him into awkward situations because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could alleviate the cruelty of the bloodstained jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to, too.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomon had turned and stood up from the helmet, squandering the console and pouring the wine they were drinking.
The wine from the bush, so the intoxication could not serve as an excuse.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you just because you have a dull head," she said...
I don't like you, though.
He felt sorry for her and for the excessive rudeness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she resisted him.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She did not talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that she was basically like this one.
The same vast ice ocean hit them both.
The same men, even more sensitive and capricious after what they had experienced, thought the common past, than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, wandered from pubs to pubs, ready to raise their hands against any woman who dared to refuse or irritate them.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
At first, kissing is now the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; opposite of the fresh ballads that gave the console to kiss her first and then hit her.
There's an overstatement, according to Keverna, because kissing yourself was already a hooligan.
Aileen Solomons with her body showed that he had to leave.
He got out of the lounge like an old man.
She felt the heavyness of lead, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top window she watched him leave, and her companion was a man who took the brunt of himself.
Adam, leaving the garden, thought.
She felt compassion for him and the men at all, even though some of them raised their hands.
The man who turned away from her, with his back, humbled, troubled, all the fighting ability left him - why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn't remember any of the cases until today when she saw it?
Once again, Aileen Solomon looked at her feet.
Twenty years before or around the events described above, Esma Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked in Ofnau, an informal public mood control service, prepared a small report on the persistence of low and medium-level violence in the very parts of the country, where it was expected to decrease unless it ceased completely, taking into account the means and forces that were devoted to its eradication.
“A great deal has been done and much is done”, she wrote, “to alleviate the innate aggression of people who fought in the thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these confused branches and narrow settlement areas where, despite the mating of the castles, the gentle breathing of human kindness was rarely felt throughout history.
Some qualities, however, prove to be inexorable.
The higher the cave, the lower the passions it generates.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows stories of overcome obstacles and declares its deep faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only old rudeness retains its strong grip in both rural communities and urban settlements, but there is also evidence of new and vicious abuse in homes, workplaces, roads and even playgrounds.
"You have an annoying habit of writing too much," said her scientific leader, reading the report entirely.
I think you should read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum had her head down.
I also have to ask you, are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I have to answer,” Esma Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Once again, Esme insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Shut up again.
"I ask," finally Luther Rabinowitz said, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We have no prejudice here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, totally acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort results, such as what you've shown me.
Obviously, you yourself are biased against the church, and what you call "evil" and "freak" would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural love and vigor.
To continue to be bored with what has been done, if the world has been affected, as if it had happened, if it had happened yesterday, means to deprive the country of the vitality it needs.
Essma Nussbaum looked at the sides while Rabinowitz spoke.
In his head, pink, like flamingo, LED letters repeated advice that Ophnau gave the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile for your neighbor, appreciate your husband, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, talk on the phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, a song is better than a written word, but there is nothing like love.
"I fully understand what you're trying to say," Esma Nussbaum quietly replied when she made sure that her science leader had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't healed as effectively as we convince ourselves.
What worries me is that if we are not ready, we will find that we are repeating the mistakes that initially led to what has happened, if the general past has happened.
Only this time will we cast our anger and mistrust on others.
Luther Rabinovitz joined the tip of his fingers into a pyramid.
This gesture should have meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "calling the 'errors' of action that our grandfathers have committed or have not committed.
You go too far, and when you talk about them throwing their anger and mistrust at others.
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that, in understanding the past, we are not talking about "us" and "them".
There were no "us" and there were no "others".
It was a time of unrest, and that's all we know.
“For which, to be honest with herself,” she dared to insert Esme, “no part of society can justify itself well.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what was done was done.
It was then.
There's nothing more to say, we agree here.
And if you don't blame anyone, you don't have to justify it if it's appropriate or if there's something you can fix.
But why the past, if not to learn?
The past is essential for us to forget it.
If I could add one word to that--
The pyramid of Luther Rabinovic broke down.
"I will review your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcycle who drove off to the sidewalk, as described by the passers-by, "in an angry rage."
Coincidences occur.
Lesotho Army states no coup planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The representatives of the Lesotho Army have refuted the preparation of a coup d'état to overthrow the Government, claiming that they were acting against the police who were suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the country ' s army surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, claiming to have been threatened with an attempt on his life.
Major Ntlele Ntoi's army representative stated that there had actually been no coup, but that the army had responded to the threat of “political fanatics” that the police had tried to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the Armed Forces command of Lesotho has taken action by receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that really intend to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were ready to create chaos," he told the American Voice.
The representative of the South African Government, Clayson Moñela, said that the actions of the army looked like a coup.
“Although no one has filed claims of power by force, according to all the facts, the actions of the Lesotho armed forces are at present a major sign of a coup," he said.
Representatives of the Lesotho Army reported that the soldiers had returned to barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, the Deputy Prime Minister, Motega Metsing, manages the Government in the absence of Taban.
Tabane stated that he believed that he was being attacked by an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in his united Government.
He stated that his actions had not been undermined by the Government, despite the charges against him.
Marco van Ginkel, who is on the move, will spend the coming season on rent rights in Milan, according to Milan Channel.
A 21-year-old Dutch man will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for a medical examination.
In the past season, he went to a field of the London Club only three times.
Let's remind ourselves that Milan used to rent from Liverpool's attacker Fernando Torres.
Production in the euro area at the lowest in 13 months
The growth in euro area production slowed to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the business activity index (PMI) of the euro area production sector for Markit fell to mark 50.7 in August, dropping from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed, and enterprises were affected by the growing tensions between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The values came to the European Central Bank (ECB) Assembly on Thursday.
The markets will expect a clear plan from the bank to deal with the halt in the recovery of the eurozone, as well as the risk of inflation at only 0.3 per cent.
It is assumed that the head of the ECB, Mario Dragi, later this week, can provide additional signals that he is considering a quantitative mitigation scheme for the eurozone, similar to those used by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the brake effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more evident," said Rob Dobson, Senior Economist Markit.
The German production sector PMI, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest mark in 11 months.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause real concern, as does the weakening of Italy from steady growth to stagnation.
The momentum of the growth of the industrial engine, Germany as well as Spain and the Netherlands, also does not add to confidence," Mr. Dobson said.
The slowdown in industry is likely to further fuel oil in the fire to analysts awaiting additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist of the IHS Global Insight, said, "The best thing to say about the August survey of the euro area industrial activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "The eurozone producers are apparently finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - especially related to Russia/Ukraine - adds uncertainties to still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has apparently hit business, and especially consumers' confidence, and it is likely that some orders are being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said "more and more like" that the ECB would eventually have to make some kind of quantitative mitigation, "although we suspect it would be limited."
Mariupola residents exhibit a lively chain against militias
In Mariupola, until last week, everything was calm — no one had rushed to organize the Mariapolis People's Republic, and the city on the Azov Sea lived and worked.
Now the inhabitants are horribly awaiting the arrival of the militia.
According to the polythologists, separatists break through to Mariupol to get to the Azov Sea, recently the city of Novoazovsk, which had not been part of the self-proclaimed republics before.
The Mariapolis decided that the Ukrainian army would protect them, although it had little against the excellent armed representatives of the DNR-LNR, and had come together to assist the military.
They grow trenches, build roadblocks and strengthen.
On Saturday evening, several thousand people came to the eastern border of the city and got up in a live chain, singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They intend to do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and drive equipment and products, collect drugs, publish newspapers.
Shops are gradually closed in the city, banks and ATMs are shutting down.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the terrible grip of school, as children who have been in it still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom children, were killed during this three-day test, which has rocked the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death during school atrocities.
Just ten years after the terrible capture of the Bezlan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors of the disaster warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed to be something of the least possible evil.
Tragedy brought together the East and the West in reprisals, which miraculously then turned into action and the hope for the future in the face of the greatest tribulation.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who had deceived death during school atrocities.
We have discovered amazing young people who have faced adversity, although the memories of a terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that now plagues Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now cease.
The girl who's trying to get back to the shooting gym in the photo.
It was recorded in a photograph of a prominent Russian photographer, Dmitri Belakov, when she tried to get back into the shooting room in one of her underwear after the mines exploded.
In the confusion of Aida, she desperately sought out her mother, Larissa, who is now 40 years old.
There were fears that both of them had died, but they had actually survived.
"The woman told me to run away, but I couldn't," said Aida.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier improved it and took it to a safe place.
After a series of operations, she thought she had completely recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
There's a few scraps left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people, just like her doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it certainly hasn't broken it," she said with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and we cannot change that fact.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remind everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain's too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Der Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the seizure stays with her, although the memories are a little tight every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from the British people and from everywhere.
When I see a picture on the Internet, where I go to the school window, I think many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn't happen again.
A boy who ran through a hail of bullets believing that his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (Russians begin school at the age of seven) and he spent three days in prison hugging his mother, Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there's an explosion and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran away and saw the crying baby on the road, grabbed the child by the hand, and ran through the city of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son from the outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara went free and was in hospital with injuries on her feet, thinking that her son had died.
After their reunion, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran away and hugged me.
Ladies were later brought to London (now a non-existent newspaper News of the World), where he was rewarded as Child Protector from the Barnardo's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Sheri.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Still, I can tell he's missing out on my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy weapons right after that.
But now I can play computer shooting games, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I used to play in the yard that never got out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store, where I was allowed to choose everything I wanted and drive in a car with an open top.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the grief he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who was doing volunteer work in a women's monastery last week.
That's how I want to help.
I want to serve with the police sometime, and I hope to be enrolled in the school academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, age 48, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the awful silence right after the grab, there were just no kids screaming and running around, and this silence lasted for months.
She vividly remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I understood how people at the other end of the earth could understand our feelings and support us.
She was grateful to Sherry Blair and her fund for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember seeing her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to take a borscht, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shot them with his water gun, and they ran and played with him.
And it's been a month since our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I don't think this world has gotten any better in 10 years.
Now there's a war going on in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of kids have been killed and killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for many people, war is a news report that they listen to when they're bored or when they're doing something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, not aggressive at all, not evil.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not stuck in this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from this - I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys.
I find it hard to believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around, and I saw parts of my body lying all over me.
I was absolutely certain that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember shouting to him, "Damir, run, run," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
This is how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
George Ilyn, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photograph after the capture became critical to the tragedy in Beslan
Peace: survivor Beslan George Ilyn with his mother Fatima after the 2004 capture, and the Georgie case today
On his bloody face was a mark of fear when he was saved from death when Chechen terrorists shot at his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, the chief physician, took him to school on the first day of school before taking Vladimir’s eldest son to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare," she remembered.
Not all alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia survived.
The closer that date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There isn't a day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it's happened yesterday, some scenes these days all the time in front of me.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
In the shower: the photograph of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in the sculpture (right)
I remember George wanting to go to school that day, saying he wanted to hug a teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of a weeping George in San Marino.
Georgie doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in our house's bookcase.
I understand that, but I also feel that this photograph has caused people around the world to feel our pain.
George now says, "It's important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never know the truth.
Now they're investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what she was called into?
This world is coming to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need tens of years to forget her a little bit.
She's affected my health, and I can still feel her.
I had nightmares about three or four years because of the seizure, but now it's gotten better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gymnasium before every September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget that, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life is going on.
I graduated from school this year and went to a medical university in Vladikavkaze.
I'm going to study to be a cardiosurgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be military, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
George Farneyev, 20 years old
The boy who survived, despite being at the feet of a killer terrorist
Unbelievable: Georgi Farnyev was at the feet of a killer terrorist while he was taken, but he managed to survive.
At the time of the takeover, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the killer's foot.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We think it was yesterday," said George, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB, but failed because of the damage caused by his health during the seizure.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that kids are easy to deal with with bad things, - I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget that.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, for the next year, it was the first and last time I entered this sports hall again.
I've lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous photo.
Survivor: Georgi Farniev with a photo of himself open on laptop today in the hospital after the seizure
My pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As far as my physical condition is concerned, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that's been damaged, but now I'm walking fine.
But my health prevented me from going to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wished.
I sent my papers, including medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My second attraction was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He's learning to treat all the animals from cats to cows.
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
This is not what children should know, and of course not what they must survive.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary comes.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to mark it.
I know Georgie won't go.
It has to be even stronger for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help it.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He stays with us.
George is an adult now, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair is happening to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't work on his knees.
He's had a few surgeries, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say he overcame this nightmare by 50 percent, but it's impossible to completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the seizure, and this only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people that I knew well and that were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could ever give me, but my heart hurts for those who have been killed.
I know the families where new children were born, but I know widows who never got married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I see what's happening in the world, wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I find that hard to believe.
We were one friendly country in the past, how come we're fighting now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could catch all the rebels and throw them away as far as you can.
Alena Tskaeva, 10 years old
A young man who was taken to a safe place by a Spetnaza fighter
Saved: Alan Tskaev is carried to a safe place by the Russian Specialnasian fighter (left).
She's ten now, and she has no memory of a monstrous crime.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alana was taken out of a captured school in Beslan by a Russian police officer.
The terrorists released her, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Christine and Brother Mahar in the school gym.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Alan’s mother and sister died in a deadly battle.
Her father, Ruslan, has been remarried since then, and he and his new wife, Svetlana, have a little daughter that he named Christine in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alena, now ten, remembers nothing about the capture and blossomed into a smart and vibrant girl, says the neighbors.
"They're a great happy family now, and Alan and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father who wants to keep them away from all memories when it comes to the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.
Sindzi Kagawa, a paralegal who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund's Borussia, noted that he was looking forward to returning to the field in the form of a German club.
He said that this transfer was a joyous event in his career.
Of course, I'm very glad to be back playing for "Borussia," bringing Bild to Kagawa.
I feel very good.
A lot of positive emotions, and I look forward to getting back into the field in the form of "Borussia."
It is recalled that Kagawa moved to the MIU from Georgia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was unable to establish himself in the English Club, spending only 38 matches in two seasons in the England Championship, throwing six balls and giving eight performances.
A man charged with assaulting a girl at the Pelican pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man will be tried for assaulting a three-year-old girl at the Pelican pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly knocked down a girl at the Pittenwin crossing in East New York.
Prosecutors stated that Mr. Stuart was leading his Audi Q3 without proper caution and attention and had knocked down the girl, which resulted in her injury.
Stuart, 78, from Anstruter, denied his guilt at Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, royal attorney, set the date for the January trial.
Obama, Merkel and Holland will not be loaded in Vladivostok
The duty-free trade shop of Duty Free Airport of Vladivostok has placed a plate banning purchases in this store by a number of world political leaders.
Do not burden them with spirits and vodka and cognac.
The store administration decided that the President of the United States, Barack Obama, the Chancellor of the FRG of Angel Merkel, the President of France, François Allland, Vitaly Klicko, Julia Timoshenko, the Prime Minister of Japan and several other well-known associates could not be loaded with vodka, cognac and spirits in their store.
And I put a plate on the door.
Obama had previously been banned from an even less accessible facility, the Dietary Table ICU, as reported by the General Service website.
Whether the American President had ever dreamed of eating in a diet table in Russia, it is unknown, but the authors of the bans clearly seem to themselves terribly witty.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to the agrarians
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that, under the embargo, Russian agrarians should acquire new technologies to produce the raw materials they need.
The advice was given during a visit to the Agpticicoprom firm of Agrocomplex.
The Head of Government also advised the restorators to refocus on Russian meat, which is of the right quality.
The annual food embargo has been introduced in Russia since 7 August.
The main coach of Russia's assembly Valentin Maslakov is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, third place is a good result in the absence of targeted competition preparations.
Our athletes spoke at their own level, bringing forth the "veve sport" of Maslakov's words.
The third place is confirmation of our sufficiently high command level.
It is a pleasure that the advantages of the French and even the Americans above us are minimal.
We have to bear in mind that we have not prepared for these contests.
The season is over, and we did not commit our leaders to the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we have become the second in the tournament, but this season has been renewed.
The French, on the other hand, exhibited a combat team comprising 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which was publicly announced on many occasions.
But even such a compatriot of competitions could not resist the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have made such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were less orderly than in the same "Brilliant League".
Season's over.
Of course, athletes are no longer so important to the result, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And as a result, I agree, there was absurdity when men were so involved in tactical skirmishes that they showed the result below the average level... of women's runs.
4 tips on how to improve the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to photograph or shoot a video underwater, you have a number of options.
The cheapest option is a watertight mill, e.g. Nikon Coolpix AW120, or ex-camera, e.g. GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for approximately $300.
I took these pictures at a family holiday with a couple of cameras, everything at a cost of about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, a few rules are needed to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a watertight chamber, make sure that the battery of the cells and other compartments are closed.
In addition, tune your camera for the kind of photos or videos that you're going to shoot.
Some cameras have scan modes or object type that optimize the exposure for dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can go down.
Some cells are only 5 feet long, others 50 or 60 feet long.
Look at our customer guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and watertight models.
Take some shots, because many of them won't make it.
There's a D.C.I.D. that'll help you compose the photos, whereas there's usually no ex-camera.
Even if you have a CDD, it will be difficult to look under water, and the frame design will be an accidental process.
Therefore, make some personnel.
Also, if your cell has a sequential imaging mode that takes several personnel off with a few different exhibits, use them.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light is significantly reduced than you dive under water.
If possible, stay on the surface when you are taking pictures in a pool, a river, or an ocean.
This will also allow you to pass more color on the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Swim closer to the site of the survey.
It's an excellent land survey advice, but it's even more important under water because of the dark light conditions.
Especially if you're shooting on an ex-camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you have to get closer to the camera objects if you want to fill in the frame.
The 2012 Olympic Bronze Fair for the Free Fight Billal Mahov can take place in the Greco-Roman struggle.
This was reported by the chief coach of the war effort of Dagestan, Sajid Sajidov.
The specialist did not rule out the participation of a sportsman at the world championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
At present, Bilal Mahov is in the process of collecting the team of “classics”, bringing the “R-Sport” of Sajid Sajidov.
In fact, according to the boys, Bilal also spoke in both styles.
At the 2005 Youth World Cup, he was the winner of the Volunteers tournament and the third prize in the Greco-Roman competitions and decided to focus on the free struggle.
It was a long time ago that a new phase of its career would take place in the Greco-Roman struggle.
I'd like to say more, Machov can already perform at the world championship in Tashkent if he wins the prize.
But a decisive word is always behind the coaching staff headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of person whose personality might have pushed everything around, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
An anesthesiologist counseling, he devoted his career to the relief of the sick, both from the suffering of the disease and from the pain of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalled that there was an MI-6 officer who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson realized that while the doctor was involved in diagnosis and illness, those who undergo treatment were mostly concerned about something completely different, the pain.
One time in 2007, however, he became the ones who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength.
In his struggle with flu-like symptoms, he discovered that he was irritably contradicting his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen faster, not later," he said.
When Juliet left for the week, Lawson discovered that he was unusually and incomprehensiblely upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to do an x-ray of the chest.
Just two weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The X-rays came back.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affected the skull, or the lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine the exact cause.
Although some smokers have lung cancer, for example, not all patients with lung cancer.
But the mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, contact with asbestos, fibrous construction material, which was once called "miracle", but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be overlooked.
Asbestos, after all, is from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the recommended industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was used, only individuals from specific industries worked closely with it: pipelines, builders, carpenters and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era, it hardly sees cause for concern today.
But such tranquillity is wrong.
Britain is now on the verge of an epidemic of mesothelioma.
More people die from mesothelioma than any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of about 2,500, more than twice as many people die from this disease than car accidents.
Annual number of deaths from mesoteloma since 1980 and projected deaths in the future in Britain
The reason why we feel its deadly effects now is that although asbestos has been used unlawfully for many years (all types of asbestos have eventually been prohibited by law in 1999), mesothelioma usually takes decades to develop.
The mesothelioma attack is not limited to veterans of industrial engineering.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, founded in the house where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we shop.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, level of abundance, profession or age.
The pools of choice, from fashionable London universities to private schools, did not seem to be a rescue.
Parliament building pierced by asbestos.
Even hospitals designed to treat us have become reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't an insulator.
In fact, he had to think about where he could get in touch with asbestos.
Then he condescends.
"It is said that there could be a lot of asbestos in tunnels in Gaia Hospital, where I spent six years on an internship," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors, and freighters used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers are going to get the same disease?
That was a question which, unfortunately, he could provide a partial answer.
“Of the four doctors who were interned in Gaia Hospital and who subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years”, he noted in a letter in 2010, “I am the one who remained alive”.
How many of us are going to be sick with this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
Living so long is unusual.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
She's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat the question of Lawson, "How many of us are going to be sick with the same disease?"
According to Professor Julian Pito, the leading expert on mesothelioma in Britain, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is to survive, some 90,000 people will die.
Most people don't now think they're going to die like that.

A quick review of court reports, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma attack has spread.
In this June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janis Ellen had been in contact with asbestos.
She worked on a network of nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading a department of clothing on two sites, one of which was a major store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She has two children over 20 years of age.
"Before it happened," she said, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't think it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They were named after the word “asbestoform”, which means a fibrous structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in blood panels, filled with tile, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler sutures, even in brake wells of cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage” that could lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amozite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
Britain was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that “there are strong, though indirect, grounds to believe that this is the main reason for the extremely high number of mesothelioma patients [in Britain]”.
Marks & Spencer was hit by asbestos at the company's main store on Oxford Street, London Alamy.
Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that “the substantial percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known impact on work or home, was likely due to the environmental impact of asbestos”.
Much of this impact, he said, is due to the “ordinary use and impact of the weather” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which looked at the Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even at the very centre of the government, could have been exposed unwittingly.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committees were infected with asbestos, which could be driven by deadly fibers as harmless as “strong air flows”.
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems to be the opposite.
Although the Parliament ' s Maintenance Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a “clean sanitation certificate”, it now recognized that work should be done on £1 billion in the reconstruction of Parliament, improving electricity and asbestos removal, and that after the 2015 general elections, members of Parliament might meet at the QE2 conference centre not far from the Westminster Green Rocks.
Goddard's report noted that “the asbestos situation was not managed in accordance with the various rules”.
It is impossible to know whether this mismanagement is going to cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of the people who failed to contact asbestos was Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50 years old, suspects he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos claims were successfully filed,” he said, “but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places he worked and the dates.
What he remembers is the day in early December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of an operation late at night.
All of a sudden, I was getting a little sick.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain was coming from the skull, the lining around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
After all, he couldn't go to work for a month.
Cursed doctors took chest X-rays and placed pleural catheters to extract fluid from the lungs and send it to analysis.
Still, his condition was undiagnosed.
Gradually his health improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he was involved in sports and breathing heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients came to the hospital with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with a mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott did not link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was tens of years older and worked with asbestos directly.
The link was obvious in that case.
Abbott's condition deteriorated again in September 2011, and the consultant showed the results of the C.T. and the X-rays to the team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel unwell, a sensor equipped with a camera was placed in the hollow between the shell of his chest and the shell of his light.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just go further," he says.
I wasn't too worried about that, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came a week between Christmas and New Year's: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: mesothelioma diagnosed
Abbott suddenly got into contact with Macmillan’s nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the magnitude of the epidemic.
"It turns out asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos thermal insulation was quite often on pipes," he said.
People who have been affected by asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, the mesothelioma is now striking younger people with atypical profession.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in the basement, so patients are unlikely to be harmed.
But many of the staff who walked through the tunnels to get from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) are almost certainly exposed to toxic substances.
For several decades after the war, hospitals were found to be a place where, theoretically, they saved lives for patients, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
The schoolchildren installed Bunsen burners on asbestos bases
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and mayors because of its amazing isolation and fireproof features.
Schools, too.
In fact, many are likely to have been affected for the first time by asbestos in class.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry classes, schoolchildren placed their Bunzen burners on asbestos bases.
Websites have emerged focusing on asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, harmless things, such as the outer tile or the roofs of the barns, usually contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison planted in a huge number of our buildings,” notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Gaia Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could recall was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful, have a garden shed.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is enormous.
"It takes a lot of time to realize that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to go and figure it out.
Well, I'm not meeting Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was to move from a doctor to a patient.
As an incalculable number of patients before him, he remembers being hit with the amount of information he had to receive.
"It was hard to understand," he says.
"I asked my doctor how much time do I have?"
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see Christmas anymore.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, because it is the mechanics of how we support life -- the act of breathing itself -- that causes cancer that kills.
Most mesothelioma cases are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is destroyed and the fibers are inhaled, they can be trapped in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem arises from the inhalation of asbestos needle fibers”, by Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Gaia Hospital in 2001.
It was the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was affected by asbestos, now, ironically, by the fate leading the mesothelioma treatment centre.
Trejer knew Lawson and treated some others who may have been affected by an internship in the hospital.
When asbestos needles fall into the tissues of the lungs, says Treger, “the breath is pushing them to the periphery where the shell is located.
This is, in fact, an invasive process from the very beginning.
The usual treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, is caused by heated disputes.
Some people think it's worth a shot.
The soberer disagrees.
"It's impossible to cut the weed," he says.
You can't walk around with a knife.
In the meantime, this cancer is “not good for chemotherapy”, which is “acting”, but does not cure.
"Sometimes the sick live long," says Treger.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live far, much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen J. Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became sick with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after the diagnosis, became a single support and counselling office for the same patients.
"Hello, Rakovya Central," he said cheerfully when they called.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
At first, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "sooned to give the whole thing a slightly more positive coloring."
Having met several experts, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loik Langz-Lazdunski, professor of Tuesday surgery at Gaia Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need to send, I just called them, and they accepted me," Gram admits.
The average patient would have to be directed and approved for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma in order to obtain the best treatment available.
However, when such treatment is finally ineffective, many patients face another financial concern about the future of the families they leave behind.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan at the Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It was known that asbestos was harmful to health since 1898," Morgan said.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small quantities could be at risk.
It was then that they spoke of the inadequacy of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Gaia Hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not “a full-cost settlement”, according to Morgana, because Lawson could not clearly prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Gaya Hospital.
After investigating his death, the representative of Gaia Hospital confirmed, however, that “asbestos in the basements concerned had been removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, linking deadly contact with asbestos to one company or place of work, usually decades after that, has proved to be a major problem for mesothelioma patients requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers switched owners or closed down.
The insurance records could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that there is no time on their side, of course, for the plaintiffs.
In response, serious new legislation has emerged this year, which facilitates the compensation process of the mesothelioma patients, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under the Act, a £350 million insurance fund has been established for those who have been diagnosed since July 2012 and who can prove to be in contact but who are not to be tried.
In such cases, the sick will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary compensation case, about £120000.
About 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that £350 million is “very good work” for the insurance industry.
“It’s a deal written by insurers,” he said, implying that a quarter of what the insurers would have had to pay had the interim period not interfered with and the mesothelioma patients could have followed the company and filed a claim in a normal manner.
Even Mike Penning, formerly Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was “incomplete”.
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that while seven people die every day, quick action was needed.
"People are suffering so much, and they need help today," Penning said during his second reading of the Bill of Mesothelioma last December.
By then Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loika Langz-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Langz-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considered effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, tritherapy in which Langz-Lazdunski boasts 40 per cent of the five-year survivors.
Abbott felt a rush.
"This is, of course, one of the most important things," said Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There is some power that supports you.
When you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott went to surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
The following scans showed no sign of disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.
I should have just turned 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
Again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of tumors.
However, this process is both physical and emotional.
You can think of practical things -- finance when I die, for example, or what it takes to show my wife how a timer works on a water heater.
When you receive bad news, you become disheartened.
We need to look forward.
Like Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Tamzin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I first got diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn't live until I was old.
They reacted in a very different way.
The Thames are very common and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a lot of calls very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that suffers from all cancer.
But for mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even by the possibility of survival.
This disease carries a grim certainty (even after all) for Stephen Jay Gould.
According to Andrew Morgan, “mesothelioma does not constitute a threat to life.
The bodies of the embalmed pharaohs are turned into asbestos tissue.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen the castral and to increase heat.
The Elder's fluid is described as asbestos.
Now a canvas is invented that doesn't ignite.
I saw the napkins that he made burning in the fireplaces at the banquets.
The modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to produce paper (even bills) and tissues.
Large asbestos mines are opened in Canada and South Africa and shortly thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It's the perfect heat insulation for steam engines and turbines of the Industrial Revolution.
The global production of asbestos is increasing to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Statistics from Prudential identify premature death among asbestos workers who are therefore denied life insurance.
Nelly Kershaw is dying in Rocdale.
Dr. William Cooke shows that the asbestos particles in her lungs "are, without a doubt, the primary cause of death."
This is the first case of this type.
Kershaw's employers, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not accept responsibility.
No compensation shall be paid.
During the Second World War, shipbuilding, one of the most lethally dangerous professions in contact with asbestos, is on the increase.
Voluntary industrial ban on import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful action against health caused by contact with asbestos in Britain.
More than 4213,000 tons per year in global asbestos production.
Britain imports 139000 tons.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety in Britain requires that all asbestos contractors receive a licence.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in Britain.
All asbestos use is prohibited in Britain.
The Mesotelome Act was adopted in Britain.
A compensation scheme of £350 million has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is held at around 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protestors swear revenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite increasing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to trigger long-awaited protests in the Hong Kong business quarter, as activists began planning and mobilizing in the hours after that statement.
The decision of the National People ' s Assembly of China essentially allows Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It has not deceived our expectations, but it does lead to rage," said legislator Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They tricked Hong Kong's men.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
Protecting China's decision, Lee Fey, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the All-Thai People's Assembly, said that allowing the popular election of Hong Kong leader would be too chaotic.
Since 1997, when the UK transferred control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has pledged to allow the people of the region to elect by vote the head of government, starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented the decision taken on Sunday as a democratic step forward, as it gives the Hong Kong the right to a direct vote; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands by means of a commission to appoint candidates who are heavily controlled from Beijing.
And according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision was taken after summer, when one of the largest and broad-based protests in Hong Kong took place over the years.
A large part of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, which has been threatened by the organizers of the Hong Kong financial district if Beijing does not guarantee genuine universal electoral law.
On Sunday evening, just a few hours after the application, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain outside the headquarters of the Government of Hong Kong.
In the demonstration, the organizers stated that their movement was moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise in protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently in an attempt to avoid problems with the public authorities.
In an online statement, organizers reported that the movement “was considering the possibility of taking the central area only as an exceptional measure, which could only be taken if all the options of the dialogue were exhausted and there was no other choice.
We regret to report that, to date, all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the capture of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
Government agencies in Hong Kong were preparing for Beijing ' s statement for several days, and security measures with police and barricad were strengthened on Sunday at the Government headquarters.
There is a sense of unrest in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
Inflows from the mainland increase competition in goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to wane under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticise Occupy Central's movement by saying that his demonstrations put business at risk, a source of Hong Kong's life force.
“The protest they are talking about can cause great economic damage depending on how many people will participate and how long,” said Regina Ip, legislator who has long criticised the movement.
We do not want the concern that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
This is an idea that is harmful to investment.
The Chinese public media also reported in the last days in which the Hong Kong Democratic Movement activists were shown by Western Powers' divertors.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, involving 78,000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong ' s voters.
In July, tens of thousands came out of one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
American prom culture reaches university life: freshman students are invited to come on a personal plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the first “luxe” travel service in Britain for current students.
To leave a clear impression of the arrival at the university, the company also offers options such as personal aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said that the service thought about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to drive their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new options for the VIF, we look forward to helping students this year reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
The representative of the company said that, since the service had just been launched, no orders had yet been received, but added that “students would start ordering this service within the next few weeks”.
The company also stated that despite the need for students to pay £9,000 per year for training, it hoped to find a market for this service.
Present students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: more important than ever, to make an excellent first impression, and the VIF is exactly what it takes.
Nevertheless, the National Student Union has criticized this service as a reality-free service.
Megan Dunn, vice-president of the NSS for higher education, said: "This project seems incredibly remote from the lives of most students.
Many students who will begin university education this month face a cost-of-living crisis when available financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to meet rapidly increasing expenditures on basic needs before they can even begin to think about bringing up thousands of pounds for something simple to come to the dormitory.
Feminists raise the question of race and police behaviour after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come raise their hands and scan, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri related to the murder of unarmed teen Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Pérez noticed a shift in Internet conversation among white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminists who left comments placed gender above the race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Middle West increased and national attention was drawn, Peres saw responses from white women focusing on 100 per cent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the killing of 9 August, personal essays with headlines such as “the thoughts of Ferguson from the face of a white woman” and “Feminism — it is not just the oppression of women” appeared relatively late.
But for Pérez, they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic of the crisis we've been facing, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so related to race, they felt they had to point to it.
For an English professor at Ohio State University, Mitchell Ferguson highlighted the problems that black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as “female problems” in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I'll get 150 locusts from around here," says Mitchell.
When I write about how colorful people are attacked in their own country, silence deafens.
"Why do women speak freely about relationships but not about security in the public sphere?" she asked.
For black women, like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly share these problems; they face difficult realities every day.
While white women now combine race and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, said that their predecessors had done the opposite.
“At least 10,000 black men were lynching between 1865 and 1890, and the reason for this was almost always the rape of a white woman,” said Hattery.
It took a white woman to corroborate the story to justify lynching.
According to Hattery, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragists, such as Susan B. Anthony, examined the situation in the late 1800s and found that the struggle for electoral law would only be effective for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in a basket of voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks should have appeared later," said Hattery.
Looking back on such things gives us a clear picture of why colorful women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained voting rights in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynching in the South Women ' s Association for the Prevention of Linching.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From the point of view of Mitchell, the response of white feminists to the problems raised by the Ferguson situation -- police behaviour, racial discrimination -- reflects the time when white feminists had to “took up” problems that black women faced in several generations.
"Really, it would be great if activists who have such a [traditional feminist] ideology were equally serious about the right to raise a child, as they do with the right to contraception?" Mitchell asked.
The second wave feminists who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what that means.
A famous white feminist activist, Gloria Steinem, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, took advantage of Facebook and published a sharp article by a columnist, Guardian Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans take more part in racism protests.
"I hope that women who have another but similar reason to understand the dangers of the body - and the views on racial issues that differ significantly from those of the public - will be at the forefront of change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem is charged with more cross-cutting feminism, which includes both racial and gender issues, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
American Entrepreneurship Institute researcher Christine Summers, author of “Who Stolen Feminism?”, said She The People that young men in the United States, especially colorful young people, “are much more vulnerable than their sisters”, but Steinem’s trailers contradicted the criticism she had previously expressed.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small programme, “Serve my brother” to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking youths, the anger of many feminists, including Gloria Steinem, was followed.
The attitude of the police with the black community is not the only problem that promotes the forward line of traditional feminism.
After the US Border Service arrested some 63,000 minors without escort at the south-west border of the country this year, immigration reform again surfaced - this time as a women's problem.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that all she needed to do was share the stories of immigrant women in order to present the problem as important to women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued to [migrating men], the women who come with them are in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are a response from women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich House With Pigs Sold
The photo of the house sold in Saffolka was taken away by real estate agents when it turned out to be a large pig resting in the living room.
Offered for sale for £120,000, a separate one-bedroom house stands on a private road in Ipswich.
A detailed description was made of a photograph of a guest house, depicting a pig with a head on the couch.
The Connells Real Estate Agency reported that the pig in the photo is a pet owner of the house.
“However, the photograph was placed by mistake and already removed”, the representative of the company reported.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former house of congregation as "a unique separate house with a single bedroom."
Although the agency removed the photograph from its website, it is still in advertising material.
The sale of the house aroused interest in social networks, where some asked whether the pig was sold with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the match of the fourth round of US Open, Caroline Wozniacki, believes she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year in a dignified manner and try to get to a new level, she is transferring Vasily OSIPOV from New York.
How will you generally evaluate your results in the "Big helmet" tournament this year?
Of course, I'm glad we won the Rolan Garros.
As for the three other tournaments, I lacked stability, especially at the ends of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn't even get to the quarterfinal.
What challenges do you have for the end of the season?
After my injury, I have great motivation to get to a new level.
I've got something to work on, and I'm gonna do everything I can to make it worth your while.
The Asian series of tournaments starts in a few weeks.
A member of the Committee of the State for Physical Culture, Sport and Youth Affairs, former World Champion Nikolay Valuev, proposed to grant bonuses to the GTO when entering a university for implementation.
He said that generally the rules would be the same as in Soviet times, that people would pass the standards of attraction, running and other exercises.
Remember, the 12 entities of Russia will start implementing the WTO rules on 1 September in their territory.
I also invited schoolchildren who had given the TTOs to give bonuses on entry into schools, said Valuev.
For example, they may be able to add some points to the EGE.
There are also proposals to provide additional exit workers for enterprises that have undergone these sporting tests.
In the town of Harvey, South Wales, there was a new millionaire after winning the lottery.
A lottery game from Harvey this month.
There's a search for a new millionaire south-west of Perth, where one lucky guy takes home almost $1.1 million from a lottery game Saturday night.
Harvey's newspaper kiosk brings gold in the middle of the game for the second time in five years, the last win was $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still needs to declare himself.
The owner of Steve Forward's bench said that the winnings were caused by a swath in a small town south-west of Perth.
The whole town's talking about it, and everybody's very excited.
We thought it might be a secret win.
Eight West Australian winners celebrated last month's prize winners, noting the completion of several good weeks for state players.
Last week, a gamer from Canning Weil became one of five millionaires in August, following a huge $7.5 million win by a couple from Belmont just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple has been playing for twenty years and has reported that winning has given them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
A millionaire from Harvey is bringing the winning prize in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total win of $85 million.
Mine-development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric car market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will introduce an integrated plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, the Deputy Director of the Ministry of Oleg Pluznikov on a round table, which was held by the Knowledge on the Moscow Motor Show 2014.
The plan is commissioned by the Government, one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted at the end of September - early October, says Pląznikov, the proposed measures relate to electric vehicles and hybrids - the gas fuel vehicle development plan in Russia is already in place.
The plan (copy with the News) is for 2014-2017.
The criteria for the assessment of electric and hybrid transport should be developed and decided on how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally sound vehicles.
A report to the Government describing the tax and customs support measures for the electric company will be prepared by December 2014; a concessional credit scheme and a concessional leasing scheme will be available by April 2015; and proposals to reduce car prices, stimulate localization and establish service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015 it is envisaged to amend legislation to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure (at parking spaces, loading stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to propose to the regional authorities during 2015 that they also encourage the use of clean transport, in the form of an advantage in movement and parking, for example; and by February 2016, the proposal to increase the purchase of such transport.
Finally, as early as October 2014, the Mine Economic Development will include criteria for the effectiveness of support for clean transport and the development of charging infrastructure on the list of indicators for assessing the activities of regional authorities.
The electric car market in Russia is still on its way - about 100 electric cars were sold across the country in 2013.
At the beginning of 2014, import duties on electric cars were taxed and sales amounted to about 500 grand, and the chief executive director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Pankov, predicts.
However, five times the increase does not make the electric vehicle any noticeable: in 2013 in Russia, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million cars were sold in light and light commercial vehicles.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors has imported electric cars into Russia.
The Renault import is being prepared - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says the Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships Renault in Russia, Nikola Remiz.
The majority of other electric transport producers have taken a waiting position on Russia.
The design of electric cars is also made by Russian manufacturers - "", GAS, "" but a miserable output.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to ASM-holding, AutoVAZ released 30 electric vehicles.
The demand for heights due to expensive electric vehicles, acknowledged by the Director of AutoVAZA on engineering Sergey Amanov, without the lady's breakthrough in this segment...
The development of the Russian electric car market, in addition to the roadways (these electric vehicles sold in Russia, on average double the cost of parallels with internal combustion engines) inhibits the indevelopment of the charging infrastructure (fuel units), sighs Sergey Celikov, the Autostata director.
Due to the costly and low rate of reduction in the cost of the car in the next 3-4 years, it will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, the main editor, Mikhail Podrodožanski, predicts.
On the contrary, auto-producers say that some electric vehicle models are already close to normal value.
The Russian electric car market has good prospects, and the main thing is to give consumers confidence that electricity is real; this will, in particular, contribute to the emergence of new charging stations, stresses the president of the BMW Group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented, for example, by Rossetti: several stations are being built in Moscow, and there will be about 80 more soon.
Negotiations on the construction of the tank network are ongoing with other regions.
According to Vladimir Sofiin, director of Rossetei, the company believes in the electric car market and is ready to build charges throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and a lack of a single standard for charging electric cars of different brands.
In addition, Rossets, as a network company, are not entitled to sell electricity, and the possibility of charging electric cars is being explored.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of the Russian electricity market to be the most effective.
The zero rate will be in operation by the end of 2014, the possibility of extending it, the expansion of the concessional list is under consideration.
The replacement of a transport tax on the environment (the idea is discussed and concerns all vehicles) will also support the market, but not as sensitive as Customs preferences, Pankov considers.
Transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, in contrast to Norway, where tax cuts have led to a sharp increase in the sales of electric cars, now account for 12 per cent of the market.
In Russia, incentives are also needed for motorists, such as a free parking in the city centre (as they have already done in Moscow), confident Pankov, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles in designated lanes, which Russia does not yet have.
A private plane crashed in Colorado
The Piper PA-46 aircraft crashed into the US state of Colorado.
Three of the five people who were killed in it were transferred by ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred several kilometres from Denver Airport airfield.
The causes of the tragedy are now identified.
In the Donetsk area, the captured fighters of the Donbass battalion are being treated.
The executioners were surrounded by Ilovians.
They were handed over by their own commanders, and dozens of gunmen were shot dead.
Those who survived said that if they knew what the situation was in the south-east of Ukraine they would not have fought.
108 prisoners can be called the lucky ones.
The Dohnbass battalion's drivers survived the carnage they found under Iloway.
In the armed forces of the Donetsk People's Republic, the militants spent several days actually abandoned by their commanders and authorities in Ukraine.
When it was reported from headquarters that a ring could be removed from the corridor allegedly provided, the column moved.
But in just a few minutes, shells and bullets hung from all sides.
"By the information they gave me, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave," says the deputy commander of the battalion, who has called the Lermonts.
And when we reached the low point between Multipolo and the Red Army, a crossfire started with anti-tank controlled missiles from the teeth, 30-millimeter grenade launchers, BMW automatic guns, small arms.
I had four cars in front of me, and three in the back, and there were only two cars left.
An officer with a nickname for the Lermonts says: almost immediately, at least 60 people were killed, dozens were injured, many died later.
The survivors are now being medically assisted by those they came to kill.
The prisoners are now surprised that so-called “terrorists” treat them well, provide food, medicines.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and sentenced them to death.
We were betrayed simply, they say.
Colonna, the whole battalion to be destroyed.
In the Donbass battalion, like many of his associates, Alexei volunteered, as Ukrainian news reported atrocities allegedly committed by “separatists” in the south-east.
Alexey's already seen a completely different picture here.
His mother was killed in Lugansk, not by anyone, but by Ukrainian soldiers.
A friend called me, told me a mortar fire was coming, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces, said one of the soldiers, Alexey.
After that, I wanted out of the battalion.
We weren't released from Ilowaysk, they said we were in a ring.
I've already made a deal with the commander, the report has already been written about the departure.
My congregation and I were immediately taken to Ilowaysk with Zurahovo.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 were trapped in a "clock" under Ilova.
Now some survivors admit that if time could be reversed, they would not enter the punitive battalion for anything.
All the militias were handed over to the DNR forces.
Everyone will be tested for involvement in war crimes.
In the region, a product price reduction headquarters has been established
A headquarters has been established in the Krasnoyar Region, which will limit the increase in prices for products in the region's market if necessary.
The decree on the establishment of this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters consisted of members of the Government of the Province, representatives of the executive branch and oversight agencies.
Together, they will monitor the prices of agriculture in the country.
Economic news ? Will Kiev pay $140 million for the Rosnefti?
Rosnefti head Igor Sechin stated that the company estimated the damage caused by the shooting of the Lysican NPZ in Ukraine at $140 million.
He reported it in an interview with Spiegel.
“We estimate the damages of $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian Government for compensation”, Cechin said.
According to him, the introduction of an upgraded Lysichan NPZ company was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no fighting, there were no insurgents, but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial site.
In addition, the oil of technology fell into the pipes," he said.
Remember, on 18 July, two warehouses were destroyed and two buildings destroyed in connection with the fires of the Lysican NPZ.
Liscanski NPZ, the main refinery in Ukraine, was first established in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lysican NHRI is about 7 million tons of oil raw materials per year.
The plant is capable of producing fuel from the Euro-4 standard, as well as the Euro-5 distille party.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisican NPZ were suspended due to its deterioration.
It was decided to start repairs at the company.
One year later, Rosneft received the Lisican NPZ along with other Ukrainian TNC-VR assets.
The DPRK launched a small-scale shell towards the Japanese Sea.
According to the South Korean media, this occurred around 10:30 a.m. local time by the province of Chagando, located on the border of North Korea and China.
As Interfax reported in the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, the missile allegedly fell into the Japanese Sea after flying some 220 kilometres.
Ruble falls against geopolitical pressure
At the Moscow Stock Exchange, the dollar rose to 37.15 roubles at an opening, and the ruble fell to a former basket in the face of geopolitical tension.
ETS trading per dollar started with transactions between 37.11-37.2 rb/$1, on average in two minutes, the exchange rate was 37.16 rb/$1 which is 4 kp. above the previous closure level.
The euro was 48.79 euros per year, which is 3 cops above the previous closure level.
The price of the bivalous basket was added by 3.5 cops and was 42,395 rubs.
The U.S. dollar is traded at 23 kop. above the official course, the euro is 16 kop. above the official course.
The Russian market continued to decline rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but there was no panic this time.
He continued to cut the ruble and even renewed the historical maximum to the dollar.
Investors are now playing a geopolitical downturn and possible new sanctions on Russia.
But so far it's more like an artificial hysteria spread through the media, especially Western ones.
There are not many options for imposing new sanctions on the RF.
TeleTrade “At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to be sharply weakened against the bivalous basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, Russian indices and national currency positions can be adjusted.
"Orenburg Airlines" will be tried with the "Ideal Tour"
The Orenburg Airlines filed a claim totalling 4.7 billion roubles.
Two cases will be held in October.
Various judges will deal with cases.
According to Interfax, the first lawsuit was filed on 14 August.
It's worth just over 425 million roubles.
The meeting on it was scheduled to take place on 7 October.
The second statement was made on 18 August.
His $4.24 billion roubles.
The meeting on it was scheduled to take place on 2 October.
According to journalists in the Russian Union, different judges have been appointed.
In July, the media reported on the "Ideal-Tour" debt to the "Orenburg Airlines" in the amount of 1.5 billion rubles.
Air Director Victor Zükin says it's 1.6 billion roubles.
Vitaly Savilev, the director of Airflot, calls an even greater amount, two billion roubles.
Twitter has tried to become more interesting for new users
The Twitter microblog service changed the user registration process to get new participants involved more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have dumped their microblogs.
Now the new Twitter users will be looking at a large number of recommended account services at the time of registration in order to immediately compile their readings.
The recommendations are based on those in the register of interests.
Twitter automatically places a subscription note for all automatically selected accounts.
As a result, the user will have to remove the branches manually so that he does not read to those who do not care.
If users of microblog services have previously seen only the avatars of recommended users, Twitter is now extracting a sample of one of the popular blog tweets to help create an impression of the person.
This is the biggest change in the Twitter registration page in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been working hard to upgrade the service.
This activity is primarily linked to the continuing efforts of the service to achieve a loss of momentum.
In 2014, the microblog service encountered a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a fall in the activity of readers.
The company is now desperately in need of more loyal consumers, who, once in a while, would remain long.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising.
The day of knowledge in Moscow will be tiring and rainy
The first September in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy throughout the day, meteorologists reported.
The air temperature in Moscow will range from 16 to 18 degrees, in Podmoskovje - 13-18 degrees.
With cloudy light, the weather will rain in places, and the east quarter wind will be quite weak - just 3 to 8 meters per second.
The vehicle disposal programme resumed from 1 September
Since 1 September, a car disposal programme has been reinstated in Russia.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion roubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As RF head Denis Mantourov explained, the money is allocated from the ceilings that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation through redeployment from other areas of support.
The programme covers all vehicles over six years of age.
The amount of compensation will range from 40,000 per passenger car to 350,000 roubles per truck.
Earlier, in Russia, such a car disposal programme had been in place.
The main difference of the current project, the Minister explained, is that not only is it now intended to use machines to obtain a discount, but the possibility, if the car is over six years old, to acquire a new one with a discount when the old one is delivered to the dealer by the trader, is passed on to the Interfax.
More than 16 billion roubles were spent on the previous federal utilization programme, effective from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
Thanks to it, the production of cars in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million units (plus 101.4 per cent compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
The game designer Nicky Case, known for Coming Out Simulator, decided to play a game about modern journalism.
He told me about his project in a Kill Screen interview.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but only now did he get the message.
The events in Ferguson have been a source of inspiration for the game, where protests are now taking place following the killing of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer.
The focus of the project, which is not yet named, will be how informational coverage of stories affects their effects.
A hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in areas where clashes between the police and the population occur.
A hero can take a different picture of what's going on, which will affect the course of events.
If he makes the scene sound like the police are heroes and the protestors are bandits, the police will start treating him better and letting a normal person go where an ordinary person can't go.
If he highlights events differently, his photographs can turn peace protests into a massive rebellion.
The points in the game will have to be dialed with a Twitter hero that will have new subscribers if the photos in it are popular.
The game doesn't have a name yet.
The date of exit and the platform on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how the event could change depending on how the photograph was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Case, he explained that he had considered the concept of such a game a long time ago, but initially he wanted to dedicate it not to protests in the United States but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, he realized that he lacked knowledge and skills to shed light on the history of the region.
However, when he saw media coverage of events in Ferguson, he decided to play a game on the basis of what had happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who publishes browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which describes the events in Case’s own biography, focuses on how a bisexual adolescent tries to tell homophobic parents about his relationship.
Heleté draws Ukraine into the bloodbath
The call to prepare for the next “tens of thousands” of victims by the Minister of Defence of Ukraine, Valery Geleti, draws the people to the continuation of the bloodshed, according to a communication by the IMF.
“In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the statements made by the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valeria Heletius, who declared that the operation “conclusion of East Ukraine’s liberation from terrorists” and the beginning of the “Great National War”, which would result in losses of “tens of thousands”.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the Ukrainian military department, which published the post on Facebook on his page, is a subject for research of non-military professionals," the Russian diplomats report said.
They find it difficult to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: "On the informal channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that if they continue to resist, they are willing to use tactical nuclear weapons against us."
He stated, however, that “the operation for the liberation of eastern Ukraine” had been completed.
Perez Hilton removed all the intimate images of the stars and apologized.
Today, the horror has reached over 60 Hollywood stars.
The hackers broke primitive passwords in iCloud (data storage) in smartphones, and then their intimate photos appeared on the blogist Perez Hilton's website.
Really, not for long.
Remember, the official representative of the Hunger Games star, Jennifer Lawrence, has already reported the theft of photographs from her cell phone, and has also confirmed that all the photos that shine on the Web are real.
Perez Hilton, the creator of the one-named tabloid, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues for publishing their frank images, writes The Independent.
No, no one made me do this.
I wasn't contacted by their agents.
And now I'm going to remove the frank photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice," a blogger wrote in Twitter.
However, all the revealed images of the stars have already spread over the Web.

Tony Stewart suffers from an accident, returning to the track
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended a little more than in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stuart crashed into the wall the second time his right front tire broke into 172 laps, ending his speech.
Stuart brought his car to the garage and then left without talking to the reporters.
His team leader, Chad Johnston, said 14 members of the team were upset, but now they're focusing on the race at the next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better attempt and a better finish for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hopefully we'll get better there.
Stuart first crashed into the wall earlier in the Sunday evening race after fighting with Kyle Bush, which required repairs to the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty high hope of getting to the finish," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart’s car was loaded onto a truck, and the team gathered and was ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car knocked down and killed another driver during a race on a underground route north of New York.
He decided to come back this week, and he had to win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to participate in the Persecution.
He returned to work during an investigation into a tragic incident that resulted in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who went on a road trip to dissatisfaction Stuart with during the race.
The law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the cause of the accident would continue for at least two more weeks.
No decision was taken as to whether Stuart would be charged.
The three-time champion was met with loud voices and applause when he was presented before the race.
Starting with the 12th position, Stuart went to the first 10 at the start of the race, reaching fourth position.
Then 122 laps after the Bush reboot number.
machine 18 pulled off the trajectory on the way out of turn 2 and crashed into Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart moved on, but he's down to 21st position.
Sobczak and Whitorgan breakfast with Zvetsky in Odessa
Xenia Sobczak and Maxim Whitorgan are now in Odessa, as the television broadcaster did not fail to report in her Instagram.
True, one photograph was very surprising and was very distraught by a couple.
It's taken at Zvetsky's.
"At breakfast at Mikhail Mikhalych Zvetsky Maksim explains what an Instagram is:) #odessa" - signed a photograph by Xenia Sobczak.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, no pot, no butter, and...
The couple decided that Ksusha too was a smoker, and they condemned her for it.
"And whose cigarettes?, " Smoking kills!", "Some kind of cigarette breakfast) ", "It's like at breakfast and only cigarettes on the table) ") ", "Xenia, do you smoke too?", - excited for their favorite subscribers of her blog.
Remember, Sobczak recently boasted what a delicious meal Maxim Whitorgan had prepared for her for the first time in her life.
"Happiness is when you come to the house, and your husband has prepared dinner for your arrival (for the first time in the marriage life, for what is delicious).The main thing is not to say at the end of dinner, "that this may happen every day," she boasted her husband, Xenia Sobczak.
You can see that Maxim's cooking something with a lot of hard work, and salt and baked chicken are already served on the table.
Bulgarian Prisoners Hold National Protests
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria held a national protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital city of Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands to restore the former working conditions that had recently been changed.
The salary increase is also included in the list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov.
During the month, officers protested symbolically against the new schedule of work, requiring the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the union of prison officials has repeatedly met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement has been reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (GNI) reports.
Negotiations are ongoing, the CNDP head of the Directorate-General for the Execution of Punishment Rosen Željzkov reported.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the protest by the Prisoner Union.
The army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Praut (right) appointed Justice Wongsuwan (left) as Minister of Defence
The Military Governor and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prayut Chan-Ocha, has announced the composition of the new Cabinet of Ministers of the country, with more than three posts held by generals or generals on resignation.
The army received key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praut Chan-Ocha was formally approved as Prime Minister after the King of Thailand formally approved the appointment of the head of the interim military Government for the post.
A 60-year-old military man who took power in the country as a result of a bloodless coup on 22 May was the only candidate for the Prime Minister's post.
He was elected Prime Minister at a Parliamentary meeting.
Previously, the army appointed MPs of Parliament.
According to Prautea Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
He was preceded by the continuing six months of demonstrations, during which protestors demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat.
Officially Praju Chan-Ocha will be the interim Prime Minister, as the military plans to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
There are fears, however, that the military are trying to strengthen their power in the country.
The military came to power on 22 May
Against the backdrop of the complete paralysis of civil power.
Leaders of major political parties have been temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they arrested the country ' s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglyk Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army replaced Brother Yinglyk Chinawat Taksin as Prime Minister.
Both are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern part of the country, which has often provided them with success in elections.
However, many middle-class and capital elites have entered the anti-government movement, which almost paralysed the country since November 2013.
Nobody said the media would be better, I didn't promise you that, the waitress at the new Palm Brassier is going to be embarrassed.
It has to be formally recognized that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain steadfast.
Because everybody knows that we say "Belgium" - we mean media, we say "media" - we mean "Belgium."
The restorators like to state in depth that the success of the institution depends on three factors: location, location and location.
There are places that aren't set up to be good, or even great, but some unhappiness.
In short, after sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that there used to be a coffee shop called "The City" (for the same TV show), then Odessa Mama, and also a restaurant called "Bojole" and a beer "Friend."
Now it's beer again, but it's not nostalgic-Soviet, it's Belgian.
Only the tip of the iceberg was placed above the ground: a bar stand and a few tables, and all the rest of the space was not even a sunscreen.
But it's fun here, like in a children's room: red, yellow and green walls, different color chairs, instead of windows, TVs, where girls swim.
The Belgian institutions in St. Petersburg have long been out of the news, so compare them with something.
There are eight types of spill beer (260-300 roubles per 0.5 l) and countless bottles (170-1550 rubles).
A company-positive waitress presents the menu funnyly, saying that “the media is a big seed”, and should be noted: it is the service, despite the individual defects, that is, the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected by content, but is often very unexpected.
For example, it is suggested that a meat roulette with Vallon blackness (280 roubles) is actually shard cut to the same degree that a parchment paper in comparison with it will appear to be indescribably thick.
It's only possible to feel any taste if you've bent together with a half-carpet.
It's worse with salads.
A classic left-handed (260) would be the right thing to recognize as a crime against the Belgian people: some insidious iceberg opened once a long time ago by a potato, a sour Kenyan beans, rejuvenated bacon chips, plus some marinated onions.
You won't want to meet anyone with that kind of lollipop!
The composition of Belgian salad ingredients was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If tomato worms or overcrowded shampoos could still close their eyes on immature quarters, why do the media look as if they have been able to defrost and open several times in their lifetime!
I know it's all white-sea media!
They are served in cartridges “in the sauce of your choice” (490-560 roubles per 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauces, the white wine, the seldere and the carrots, they're not really good.
There are vegetables, and there is no aroma, and if there was wine, there was no mystery.
But they're good for the mediums with the Mayonnaise.
The chicken water here is not bread, thick to the point that you can decide, depending on your mood, the first or second dish in front of you, but just a pleasant plum soup.
The rabbit was said to cook a local cook in a beer sauce, and there was no mention of rosemary.
On the floor, the situation was diametrically opposite: Rosemary choked everything.
It was felt that this rabbit was fed exclusively by rosemary bushes, which produced such an unusual aroma.
But there was this amazing little rabbit leg -- no, just a cancelling pear in a caramelized crust.
Palm waffles are offered not only with sweet but also with cheese - beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce was too watery and the waffles were dry.
But the manager at the table was very informally interested in lunch impressions.
So, we should come again.
The dollar rose to IMF more than 37 roubles on news of new sanctions against Russia coming to the West.
It's a new historical record.
The dollar for tomorrow to 10:29 msk rose by 26.9 roubles and was 37.02 roubles, the euro rose by 30 kopecks - up to 48.73 rubles, showing data from the Moscow Stock Exchange.
The former basket grew 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Prior to the Crimean events, the dollar reached a maximum of 36.43 rubles on 19 February 2009 and was already 37,005 rubles on 3 March 2014.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is of a long-term nature, both in pairs with the euro and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term forecast implied this mark, says Senior Ana Bodrov, Ana Alpari analyst.
Everything related to Ukraine will be reflected in courses anyway.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Rumors about the invasion of troops have not been confirmed on either side, but the market has become very emotional.
All the talk about him being resistant to such news was crossed out yesterday.
The week, according to the expert's projections, will close around those levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, policies, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine are all the links of one chain.
Inflation is also projected: 5 to 10 per cent will be added to current prices in autumn.
Soon, too, seasonal vegetables and fruits will be completed and a vacuum will occur as the networks are refocused on other suppliers.
"The dollar came to the mark in 37 roubles, went through it and came back, some kind of powerful feat is gone," said the head of the Market Analysis Department "Discovery Broker" Constantine Bushuev.
They will still be watching whether they will impose the promised sanctions on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
Ruble, he said, sharply weakened after the end of the tax season, then sent news to Ukraine, and last week the CB stated that it was fully moving to a floating rate and was refusing any foreign exchange interventions until the end of the year.
Looking at the daytime fluctuations, it was no different from the previous months, and it was all threatened by the 37 rubles mark, and the analyst continues.
And so, nothing powerful has happened in terms of traffic.
The worrying times for the currency market were, recall, when in late January there was an increased demand for currency, as well as on the third of March, when the CB shipped a record amount of currency.
UFS IC also sees the positive side of the cutoff.
First of all, it is an increase in the income of the export budget, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers by increasing imports, says UFS Chief Analyst Alexei Kozlov.
The travel of imported goods and services can be viewed as negative.
The sharp fluctuations in Russian currencies have significantly reduced the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, fuelled inflationary pressures and, as a result, caused the flow of money, which in turn hampers the country ' s economy.
When it comes to the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble somewhat smoothes down the price of shares expressed in rubles.
For example, the IMF Market Index declined by 1.67 per cent during Thursday and the RTA Index lost 3.27 per cent.
So much difference in the relative decrease in indexes is due to the day-to-day weakening of the ruble by more than 1.5 per cent.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is due to the massive desire to buy the currency.
As practice has shown, the emotions gradually fade away, and the angles of the ruble partially or completely restore lost positions.
"We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency near 36 roubles per dollar," notes Alexey Kozlov.
Genetic impairment is often misdiagnosed
Britain reported that it had spent many years thinking that it would die after misdiagnosed.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she had only a few years left to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Sharko-Mary-Tuta (SCHMT) disease, a group of hereditary disorders that caused nerve damage outside her brain and spine.
The CMT UK charity reported that the misdiagnosis was a common problem among people with MST because there was little known about this condition.
Some 23,000 people in Britain are believed to have SCHM, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, uncertain walking, and raised toes.
Patients may feel faint or pain, and the condition is not cured and progressing, which means that the symptoms are intensified over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from a Fridreich (AF) attack - a condition for which he was very poor.
Rogers thought she'd be nailed to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and died before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "I knew as a child that I couldn't do what others could do.
I've fallen every day, and I've had more time for everything.
I could never skate on a roller coaster or skateboard with other kids, and I had a lot of fun at school because of the way I went and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations to release the achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked at the medical chart when her doctor left the room, and it said that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I put my nose where I shouldn't be, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I came home, found information about this situation in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and I experienced the most terrible panic possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in this interval.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funerals.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you'd have that disease because you'd already been in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic tests, she was found with SMT.
"When he explained what S.H.M.I.E.L.D. was, I thought I had won a happy ticket," she said.
The Charity Organization of the United Kingdom announced a month of information on the ITC to try to draw attention to the disease.
Tax burden on Washington area entrepreneurs is increasing as the economy recovers
The recovering economy means more clients, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
The state and local taxes accounts for companies throughout the country have increased moderately in the past year when economic recovery has accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and there is no exception for companies in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to the state and local executions in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 per cent over the $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden on state and local business increased by 4.3 per cent last year to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent earlier, which was the third consecutive year of growth after year-on-years, when the accounts decreased in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased faster than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to a study carried out by a professional service firm, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Centre, the Tax Policy Group.
More than half of the county ' s tax revenues, 56 per cent, are taxed on entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of Maryland ' s tax revenues are taxed on firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, brings the least tax revenue, in proportion to entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the increase in tax revenues is due to the continued return to the value of companies ' real estate, according to researchers, which raised real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years, when the increase was less than 1 per cent.
While large proportions of these revenues are in large states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same is happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in real estate taxes in the state and local areas last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 -- an increase of 4.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate does not have any similar effect on tax revenue growth both in the state and at the local level in Maryland, where real estate taxes barely exceed one fifth of the corporate tax accounts.
Virginia and Columbia County pay about half the state and local tax bills in the form of real estate taxes.
"What happens in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate, especially the tax base around Columbia District, belongs to either the Government or a non-profit organization that does not pay taxes on real estate," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland has much more to rely on, for example, income taxes to pay for the same services that are available in other states.
The recent rise in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
The income of entrepreneurs also appears to be going to be adjusted, according to this data.
Companies in the region have declared a state-level corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, most in the region.
While trends are moving in the same direction, the tax burden on entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase at the same rate in all three locations.
The growth rate in the district of Colombia was at the same level as the national average, 4.3 per cent, while the growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues were raised below the average of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate) equal to 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the district it is relatively high is 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia was below the corporate tax at the state and local levels and, in general, a more favourable climate for taxpayers than in Maryland.
The district was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is experiencing competitive pressure from its neighbour from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed legislation reducing the corporate rate this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continued to achieve tax revenue targets next year, this law could bring income tax to entrepreneurs even to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small business in the Washington area seems to be feeling better and thus paying more taxes at the state and local levels, according to a recent study.
Taxes for entrepreneurs paid in the form of individual income tax to small business owners - a transitional structure under which most small firms - in the District of Colombia, Maryland and Virginia - grew by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher growth rate than corporate taxes in general.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in income from business taxes throughout the country is likely to continue this year, with taxes on turnover in both state and local governments, rising by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may be lagging behind, as the decline in federal expenditures affects the labour market in the region.
Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The world’s domestic judo champion brought two silver and seven bronze prizes to Russia’s assembly.
According to this indicator, the Russians gave in to only Japan ' s main favorite competitions.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day the silver medal was delivered to the Russian team.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who served in a category of up to 60 kg.
However, in the equal final fight against the Mongolian Balbaatar Ghanbat, the outcome of the resistance was decided by only one comment received by the Russian.
On Tuesday, the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian assembly - three medals were won immediately.
In men's competitions up to 66 kg of silver, Mikhail Pulayevu was awarded the bronze and Kamalu Khan-Magomedov.
In the final election, the Russian gave up the 2011 and 2013 World Cup to the Japanese Masasi Ebinume.
Han-Magomedov, who lost his compatriot at a quarter-final stage, triumphed in a comforting tournament and was the winner of the bronze prize.
In the women's 52 kg tournament, Natalya Kusutina also reached the third stage of the guerilla.
In the semifinal, she lost World Cup Majinda Kelmendi of Kosovo, who served under the flag of the International Federation of Judo and successfully defended the title.
Ma Inan of China won the bronze contest, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that third place was not what she expected.
Once again, Kelmendi, who had defeated Kusyutina in the European finals, became the Russian gold barrier.
On the third day of the Chelyabinsk Bronze tournament, Musa Mojushkov, who fought in the 73 kg category, was placed in a collegiate Russia.
In the quarter final, former Moldova representative Viktor Skvortsov, now in favour of the OAU team, was the offender.
But then the Russian won two fights and became the owner of the prize.
Mogushkov spoke at a local championship with a nuclei trauma, which he plans to treat soon, so he will take a break in the competitions.
As for the Scortz ex-molding, he and he got to the bronze medal at the tournament.
It is interesting that another of his compatriots, who had accepted UAE sports citizenship, had completed his presentation in the 100 kg category.
The fourth day of CM-2014 also brought the Russians one bronze, which was won by Ivan Nifontov in a category of up to 81 kg.
In the heavy battle of the small finale, he won the Frenchman Alan Schmidt by commenting on the rival.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played in the tournament, but the Russians traditionally limited one bronze to 90 kg in the men’s tournament.
Kirill Questionnaire was the owner of the medal, which was guaranteed by the Russian assembly: Kirill Denisov, a compatriot in the finals, was his confidant.
However, it was not the match itself: the rival Questionnaire was unable to get into the tats because of the trauma.
The men's bronze was conquered by the masters and on the sixth day of the competitions, which was placed in a co-container by Renat Saidov, who served in a category of over 100 kg.
In the comforting finale, he won a pure victory over Brazilian David Moore.
This has resulted in the completion of an individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, the title of world champions was played on Sunday.
Both men and women of Russia were among the chief contenders of the prizes, but, as in individual competitions, the women of the fine sex were not fortunate, until they got the medal.
And here were Russian judoists who won the command silver.
In a decisive confrontation, they stood up to the main favourites of the competitions, the team of Japan, in the fight against the 2-3 account.
However, Russia's assembly ran 2-0 after the net victory of Han-Magomedov and the Willow - Dennis Jartsev (up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories with their Japanese rivals, Murat Habachirov (81), Magomed Magmedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) were unable to cope.
The same scenario was followed by a bronze match in the women's tournament, where the Russian assembly, holding 2-0, gave way to the Japanese 2-3.
President Vladimir Putin attended the team competitions in Chelyabinsk, who, after the tournament, congratulated the men for the silver.
"Second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was clear that you could be champions," said Putin, whose words are translated by the RIA "News".
Losing the Japs, the judo's parents, there's nothing in here that's uncanny.
But I'm sure you can win from them.
Russia's domestic championship was much better than it was a year ago at a level like that held in Rio de Janeiro.
At the time, there were only three medals in the Russian team - one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansour Isaev.
We're all, of course, great perfectionists.
Yes, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person enters the Olympics into the eight most powerful, he's a potential winner of the Olympics.
Moreover, in a sport such as judo", the tournament was concluded by RF Minister Vitali Mutko, whose words are produced by the press service of the championship.
Japan's assembly is expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of different dignity, five of which have turned out to be gold.
The next world champion will be in Astana next summer.
Other materials, news and statistics are available on the summer sports page.
Joan Rivers' family hopes for the best
Joan Rivers is unaware of her arrival in New York hospital three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that an 81-year-old comedian actress would recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai on Thursday after an emergency call saying that she had had a heart attack at the East Side clinic, Yorkville Endoscopes, reporting sources.
Doctors deliberately keep her under drug abuse and under strict supervision until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “heavy”.
The response was broad, including numerous Internet support from such as Donald Trump, Montell Williams and Kelly Rip.
All will be made by kings.
In selling the debut album of the Royal Blood Group, the new hope of the British year, which brought the rock duath out of the clubs straight to the stadiums.
Duet Royal Blood has been on the stage for the whole year, but it has already won the BBC Music Awards, a warm-up tour at Arctic Monkeys and a New York performance feature from Jimmy Paige himself.
Their debut album was released several months before the release of 100,000 pre-orders, and the contract for its release is in the Warner Music Major Label portfolio.
Given the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation is not a new Lane Del Ray or another sweet-loud representative of the new R'n'B, but a duet of British-looking bulls playing with the level of loudness and intensity that was last fashioned a couple of decades ago.
In general, the first album rates in relation to all the above circumstances were particularly high and have already been fully justified.
Duet never took a name that they could have touched before, except that it was the most desperate hairless metalworms, and the blood of which the kings seemed to be flowing in their veins, too.
This is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the last level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood aims to instill the stagnant blood of the British rock, bringing it to a new height.
Predicting the success of this enterprise is likely to be early, but something can be said.
A dozen songs written in thirty minutes and a few minutes are not as much a demonstration of a phenomenal composer's donation as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the features of individual numbers can not be denied: let's say the pilot single “Out Of The Black” is characterized by what is remembered, not by a melodic line, but by a drum.
Musicians joke that this song is much easier to type than to tap.
It's also worth to identify a powerful Little Monster and a close-up album of "Better Strangers" with a Shakespeareian quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a party of heavy - rock lovers, but when they lose, they merge into a more or less uniform canvas.
And that's not necessarily a bad thing, not a bad thing.
The Royal Blood force is that they do not claim to laurels of new Lennon and McCartney (rather than to be targeted at Motörhead successors), but have led many rock duates out of the ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, was created for the stadiums, in a room of less than a few thousand people, apparently close to it.
The secret is partly in the clever use of bass, which replaced the guitar in its usual format, which was thought up at the beginning of the zeros of the White Stripes.
In fact, it's not only about the instruments, it's also about the way to make songs.
The retroglyctic heroes of the zeros were very hard to go beyond the postmodern paradigm, and they were very reluctant to admit themselves not only as epigons but as independent creative units.
The Royal Blood is already sounding so powerful and abruptly that this effort successfully scratches some secondaryity and firmness of the musical material.
After all, who said a year should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: Online Store - and Video Player, and a hundred other things - buys a Twitch stream video production service for $1.04 billion (US970 million).
This news came as a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to sell it, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sales of Twitch to Google's video service for a good billion seemed completely ready, and that combination seemed natural.
Twitch, based just three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a general flow service - a version of YouTube in real time.
Instead, it quickly became a platform where gamers broadcast their inner moments; YouTube for real-time games, according to Business Insider.
Switch interface.
And let's play, a genre of video clips in which all-knowing players give (mainly, old) processing, like "Taisy Theatre" is already popular on YouTube.
The point is that YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch was met without special interest is a classic example of an entrenched technology company that buys potential competitors.
It's a secret why the YouTube deal failed, given that he was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from the CEO of Twitch Emmet Shir: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Like me, snobs who claim they'd be better at sports than watching sports, it's hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking a joystick into their own hands.
One thing is to look over another's shoulder at 3:00 a.m. when she crawls through Resident Evil, and the other is to watch a stranger get 20 shots in the head at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them without self-control can be a recipe for a headache worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the speedy passages in which the Rogers of the Bennisters of our e-century end the entire game in record time are entertaining.
But if it's not about playing virtuoso or humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly is Amazon going to make it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch would turn to Amazon Instant Video as neatly as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that would be a pleasure for any company — the crowds of young men the advertisers dream of.
As Chapter Twitch Shir said, Amazon and Twitch both believe in future games, and this channel does not give signs of fiddle, even - oh - as a spectacular sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed as a result of the 2004 attack.
Over 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to surviving hostages - almost all now students, with the parents of the deceased, with the guardian of the cemetery - the City of Angelov - Ramon Kaspolatov, head of the Mother Beslana Committee of Susan Dudieva, who participated in the special operation of the MCS staff - tells the correspondent of the Community Department of Elizabeth Antonov, who worked on the special project.
Already back in Moscow, they met Aslambek Aslahanov, who served 10 years ago as adviser to the President of the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with the FSB of Russia, Vjaceslav Bocharov.
What particularly impressed me during my work on the subject was that in Beslan it was as if there had been no such thing for ten years.
This subject is extremely painful for all who have anything to do with it, and people find it difficult to talk about what happened.
The impressions of the trip are very heavy.
But we can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job," Antonova said.
The special project has been prepared by a study of the holding Rambler & Co, which has been working with the company since spring.
The previous special projects were devoted to World War I and to the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's stay in power.
DPRK has launched a low-range missile
North Korea launched a small-scale missile into the Japanese Sea, according to Renhap.
The launch took place about 10.30 a.m. local time by Chagando province, located on the border of North Korea and China.
The missile had reportedly fallen into the Japanese Sea, flying some 220 kilometres, the Joint Committee of the Chiefs of Staff of South Korea said.
Members proposed to expedite the entry into force of the Personal Data Law
If the initiative succeeds, Russian data cannot be stored on servers abroad as of 1 January 2015
The State has introduced a draft law to postpone the date of entry into force of the Russian Personal Data Act, from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is located in the legislative framework of the lower chamber.
Its sponsors were members of the State of Vadim Dengin, Jaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov (One Russia), Vladimir Parahin (Justice Russia), and Alexander Yushchenko (CRC).
This change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to the faster and more effective protection of citizens ' rights to personal data protection and the confidentiality of communications in information and communications networks.
The Act, which hastens parliamentarians, requires that Russian personal data processed via the Internet be stored on the territory of the RF.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, store, refine and extract PF citizens ' personal data in databases located in Russian territory, as well as to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roscomnadzor the right, on the basis of the court ' s decision, to restrict access to information processed in violation of the law of the RF in the field of personal data.
The Act also proposes the establishment of so-called “black lists” of violators' websites, the automated information system “Resister of personal data subjects’ rights violations”.
This law was passed by the Lord in the summer.
The draft was drafted by Andrey Lugova and Vadim Dengin of the LLDP and Alexander Yushchenko of the CRC.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also one of the co-sponsors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centres in the RF will have to pay for rent
Commenting on the bill introduced to the State today, the first chapter of the Thought Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin, stated that he saw no problem in transferring the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
He said that companies that would not have their own personal data storage facilities in Russian territory by 1 January 2015 would be able to rent them, for example, “in Rostekecoma”, which had repeatedly said that they were ready to rent their servers and were already providing their servers to the Mail Group, to Western companies that are already providing their servers today”.
"There are also several independent data centres ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
“If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work in the territory of the RF, I see no problem, they will be given technological facilities for deployment”, Levin summed up.
Controversy Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications expressed its concern that if the draft law was adopted, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, the services of online aviation and hotel armouring are involved.
According to the Association, “the bill deprives the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data by peremptoryly determining that their records, systematization, etc. should only be provided in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement stressed that a more effective measure would be to establish a user-awareness mechanism for recording, systematizing its personal data.
In such a case, he would be able to choose the territory in which the acts would be carried out.
The adoption of such laws on “localization” of personal data in other countries has led to the withdrawal of global services and significant economic losses.
Participant test with bucket of icy water pushed out the jaw
Isabelle Roberts of Britain screamed so hard when icy water was poured on her head, that it damaged the bone structure of her face.
This test of freezing water went wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed so hard during a bucket of icy water test that she sprained her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so violently when iced water was poured on her head that it damaged the face structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, but when I did, my jaw began to crack," she said.
Water flies for a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts, seconds before the accident.
I tried to shut my mouth, but he didn't shut up, he got stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister came to the same understanding, and they began hunting, but I had to rush to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old British woman was taken to a hospital to practice her jaw after taking part in a popular engagement on Tuesday.
The clip became an Internet sensation and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The militia handed over over over 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The Novorossiya Army claims to have knocked down Ukrainian Su-27 and accused the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
As at 10 a.m. on 1 September, the militia handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded and 35 soldiers killed.
This was reported by Interfax, a representative of the Novorossia Army press service.
He added that “with the power of air within the area of the settlement of the Mereška, the Su-27 aircraft was to crash, in violation of the ceasefire agreement”.
According to the Agency ' s interlocutor, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions in artillery shelling at Lugan airport.
The representative of the press service noted that the militia was able to damage two Ukrainian military helicopters at one of the field airfields overnight, as well as the destruction of two armoured carriers and two ammunition depots.
"The loss of the enemy's life force, up to a hundred people killed and wounded, was taken into custody by 13 people," the headquarters representative summed up.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed forces of the Donbass People's Republics declared that the Ukrainian side was transferred under the ceasefire of 223 captured soldiers and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, at night, the DNR Army, according to the Novorossiya Army, “cut off an attempt by the Nazgwardians in violation of previous arrangements to remove heavy equipment from the surrounding area”.
The militia then reported the destruction of two tanks and two RBMs, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 military personnel.
According to headquarters, the total loss of enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Lugansk, Mariupolsky) during the night was five tanks, eight armored combat vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers found themselves surrounded by militias in the Ilowaysk area in the Donetsk area.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the “national republics” to release Ukrainian troops from the area.
In the DNP, it was agreed to do so, provided that the opponent gave up arms and ammunition.
The first tens of soldiers began leaving the surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion, Donbass Semenchenko, another 14 persons left the club the night of Sunday.
In his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded are “in captivity to 137 regiments 32 of the RF Division and 9 of the RF Tank Brigade”, where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation have denied reports from Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
IMF: Russia to take action if EU sanctions are imposed
Russia reserves the right to respond to its legitimate interests in the event of new anti-Russian sanctions, the RF-MID reports.
A report by the Russian Foreign Ministry stated that the European Council ' s “conclusions” of 30 August had demonstrated the inability of EU member countries to overcome the momentum of their unwarranted support to the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine on the basis of “absolutely unproven allegations of Russian armed forces being present in the territory of that country”, the agency's website states.
The IMF regrets that Europe, contrary to the interests of its member States, is susceptible to the influence of countries that are interested in strengthening confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as the conditions for a full “dialogue between the opposing parties”, the department stresses.
It is also noted on the Department ' s website that there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has taken place, as well as an increasing number of civilian casualties.
We recall that during the next seven days, specific proposals for sanctions against the RF are planned in the European Union.
At the same time, EU representatives are working closely with US officials.
They are expected to correlate the introduced measures with the severity and severity of the measures.
The new sanctions of the European Union may concern energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the defence, finance and oil and gas industries.
Smart ways to save money in university textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon be in second grade, came up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system to rent books from high school students, offering them nominal compensation to postpone their sale.
"My math textbook, which usually costs $180, I got a $10 semester and a Chick-fil-A," says Schroeder, 19, who goes to Covenant College in Georgia.
The necessary literature for last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and teaching supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly choose online stores and creative ideas like Schreder's system.
Book sales are becoming more popular by allowing students to use the book during the semester, and they often cost significantly cheaper than their purchase.
Nibo Incorporated, which has more than 250 university bookshops, reports that the volume of book trafficking has doubled since 2011.
Industry studies show that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented during the last spring semester, according to Vice-President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the professional association “National Association of University Shops”.
This is an introductory course in the best way to make a profitable deal.
Shopping in an Internet store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price for a new book can be one third of what you see at a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Matthematic Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is worth about $290 per prescurant, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on the Chegg.com website, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of a supported one
If you're not against someone else's marks or injuries, the textbooks you're holding are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in supported form at Chegg.com.
Matt Casseday, 25, a fourth-grader from the University of Brigham Young, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a contained copy of the textbook "Strategic Solutions in Media: Understanding the Business of Advertising Business".
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Brecy, Director of the College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, invites students to clarify with their professors whether previous publications can be used.
There are times when updating is not essential for the exercise.
In such cases, old editions are often found at a very small percentage of the value of the last edition.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon sites, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying books held.
Sale
If you treat them well enough, do not forget to return them, and do not want to leave them to you after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student was able to rent a Math analysis for a semester of about $20.
Explain the rules of the store where you take books, including any fines that may be issued to you for markings, underlinings, and damage.
If you rent a book, remember that if you do not return the book, fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
Electronic books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually renting by acquiring an electronic license for a certain period of time from distributors, e.g. Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Matthematic Analysis" project at Chegg.com will cost about $61 for six months.
Bracey says that students who study literature can often find the most profitable prices, since many classical works can now be downloaded free of charge, whereas literature in natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what, take a look around.
Joe Holt, 29, who is about to start school at Pepperdin Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to find out the price of the book, as this guarantees that you are looking for exactly the text you need.
Before making an order on the Internet, says Holt, make sure that the book is actually in storage.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he acquired was postponed for four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin declared full inefficiencies in the Development Fund of the Far East
Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared at a meeting on priority investment projects and territories in the Far East, a budget investment fund for the Far East, established two years ago, is ineffective, reports the Interfax.
“15 billion roubles remain on deposits,” the President stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State requested that the adoption of the list of pre-development territories in the Far East be accelerated.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of TORs should be introduced to the State in that autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the President noted, had not approved, by 1 July, the list of territories ahead of development in the Far East and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main tasks for the development of the Far East.
Among them, increased transport accessibility of the region, the lifting of infrastructure restrictions, both in the internal market and for export development.
Among other things, there is a need to establish preconditions for attracting additional investment in the region, as well as for the establishment of pre-development territories that should become competitive with key ATR business centres, the President stressed.
It has been previously reported that pre-development territory can be replaced by EEZ.
Why the Galactic Guards couldn't save the cash registers
Sylvester Stallone has recovered less than $30 million from their $90 million budget in the United States, while the Sin City: A Woman Worth Killing has returned only $12 million from its $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz's Home Video brought only $14.6 million in the first weekend, while children's films, such as "How to get the dragon 2" are also disappointing.
The film critic Telegraph Robbie Collin points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be a poor quality of films themselves.
Colleen named 2014 as “the worst” year in the history of children's films and called it “How to get the dragon 2” a barely “functioning” continuation of the fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at audiences of a slightly older age, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average rating of CinemaScore and Metacritic of each film, which was released in summer at least 2,000 copies between the Memorial Day in May and 20 July, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the views of both filmmakers and movie critics, suggest that the production of films last year is similar to that of last year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that it may be in changing visual habits and the growing popularity of stream Internet services, such as Netflix.
Director John Favro, who is currently working on a fast-running Disney movie called The Jungle Book, said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think time is changing."
We must recognize this and not try to pursue what was before.
Unlike the current fall in Hollywood cash charges, Netflix’s income from the stream reproduction service has reached $1.2 billion, almost double the previous year’s $837 million.
Last summer, director Stephen Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on the franchise comic books, and predicted Hollywood's crash.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators argue that his gloomy predictions were part of the truth.
Since several potential cash hits are expected in the summer of 2015, including the Avengers: Aerius, Minenov and Jurassic Park, other film industry representatives are more optimistic.
People H's producer Simon Kinberg recently called the fall of the cassation fee simply "cyclical", said Hollywood Reporter, "Next summer will be the most cashier summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Product sanctions do not scare the owners of institutions with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants in European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
Generally speaking, it has so far preferred to replace prohibited imports from Russia, not Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
“Better is a little salty cucumber than a bad mozzarella,” breaks the chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio about the quality of cheese offered by suppliers in exchange for Italian.
Mozzarella and burrat cheese ended up in the restaurant first, having a small storage period.
Parmesan's stock should be available for a few more months.
What should I do?
Go to Russian?
In 2005, I was in the Dorogomill market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes clear that shocking memories keep him from letting go.
There the meat was only 30 centimeters [30 cm] from the floor!
There's cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we would never buy anything in Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe things have changed now.
But the other day, I got a fish sample from the Far East.
That's how she turned out to be a dead woman!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised to learn that many of Italy’s ordinary items are for the Russian wildlife producer.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is suspended in a refrigerator chamber for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It has to work out to be soft so that the muscles relax.
I did all that with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get such tender meat?"
I said it's yours, too, Russian!
Why doesn't anyone do that?
In five minutes walking from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Most" there is a stop-list in the kitchen, which lists missing products: French oysters, seafood.
Brasserie Bridge restaurant chef and Sterinka bar, director Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: French oysters have already been replaced by oysters from Tunisia and the French cheese restaurant will purchase Swiss.
In fact, Direct is getting more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "The flower cabbage is 200 rubles!
I'm like, "Why is it so much?"
I'm told, "Well, we've got to make some money."
But this cabbage shouldn't cost more than 80 rubles!
The Far East oysters we buy by weight, but they live 15-20 years, imagine how much weight their vest weighs?
At a price, it's a super-dlicate.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of scarecrows for foreign cooks.
Standard story: "The first three months were all good, then the quality fell sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibres and quality.
Many European cuisine restaurants do not know what will happen to them when the cheese supplies are finished.

Sanctions menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are mainly called product sanctions.
It is prohibited to import beef, pork, meat and by-products from domestic birds, meat delicacies, fish, milk, milk, yogurt, raw cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants started with a supply company: food prices have grown, and similar products from other countries must be sought urgently.
This will have the greatest effect on expensive restaurants from French, Italian and Spanish monocuuses, in which the products were delivered directly from the “motherhood” countries.
The public had to be rescheduled before.
For example, when Rosselhoszawzor banned the importation of Australian beef in early 2014, and one year earlier, the American and Canadian meats.
In return, suppliers have established supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But summer-2014 sanctions have become much more serious.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which remove from the prohibition of Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for sowing.
Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions can be further mitigated.
For the time being, part of the restaurants exist in a climate of uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the proportion of imports in the premium segment was up to 70 per cent.
“Dear restaurants will have to change menus for local farmers and other countries,” says Sergei Mironov, a restorator, owner of Restconsult.
If the chef's strong, that's not gonna be a problem for him.
Only we have very few cooks, and a new menu can take two or three months.
Trigel from Brasserie Most is ready to do this: you will have to give up 10-15 per cent of the dishes, and another half of the menus will have to be processed.
In mixed kitchen restaurants, meals, such as buttered beef steak, are already being replaced, says Sergey Mironov.
“The cheeses from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile,” reads Oxana Glibchuk, representative of East-West.
Fruits and milk products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chickens from the United States may be replaced by chickens from Russia and Belarus, salmon and semi-natives from Norway, salmon, semi-drinking, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of vegetables and fruit from European production can be offset by domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
Mironov felt that the budget for the restaurant network would be simpler than the premium segment: it was unlikely that there were gourmets who could distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian.
Although it's hard to have Ginza Project facilities, he thinks.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and menus.
There will be plenty of time in exchange," Mironov says.
In Ginza, comments were rejected, referring to the lack of owners in the country.
The owners of the Caucasus and Central Asian cuisine stress that products from the former Soviet republics smell European
But there are also many restaurants whose sanctions do not affect much.
These include the CIS kitchen facilities: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
“There are no expensive products in Georgian cuisine,” says Hatuna Kolbay, owner of the Georgian Saperavi restaurant and coffee "You Me!"
All the cheeses are made for us in Russia, and we don't use exotic greens as a basis for many dishes.
In Kolbai institutions, no dishes have been removed from the menu.
Timura Lansky, owner of Cheyhon N1 restaurants with Uzbek cuisine, is also not embarrassed by the sanctions: he will only have to change the lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia were to import from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we would even win the price, it would be cheaper for us than European imports, he said.
It is cheaper to get slices, lambs, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits from the CIS.
However, what comes from Central Asia is much better than that of Italy, Spain and Turkey.
The Uzbek tomatoes are all known to be delicious, sweet.
No one speaks Spanish like that.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of Uzbekistan, Olymba Artykov, said that he planned to increase the export of fruit products to Russia by half by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan stated their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Fastfood restaurants, which responded to Denego's request, also respond to sanctions in a very calm manner.
McDonald's press said that the localization exceeded 85 per cent and the network worked with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, head of the Department of Suppliers of Subway Russia, about 80 per cent of the products are purchased in Russia, although temporary difficulties may arise with the supply of vegetables and the rising prices of meat products from imported raw materials.
In "Termka", "sanctionary products" were no more than 4%.
They didn't touch the sanctions and the fake walker.
KFC, Burger King and Kartoška have not responded to Deneng's request, but other market participants argue that the level of localization of Burger King is significantly lower than that of McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, the retortors are willing to buy more Chilean than the Russian Far East
On my hunchback.
In the meantime, the restorators complain that the demand for the price increases even on local products.
"For Groblay products, prices have grown by 10-15 per cent on average, for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio, twice," says retort Roman Roznikovski.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of food will grow by 5-10 per cent, Kolbay admits.
East-West does not deny this: “For example, Belarusian dairy has traveled 10-15 per cent since early August”.
“The Brazilian suppliers have raised the price of pork almost twice,” complains Sergey Rack, Deputy Director General of the Stardogs.
Short-cut chickens traveled by 35 per cent.
We're waiting for prices from China, maybe they'll eat the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, there will be a planned 8 per cent increase in prices at the Stardogs.
It's very undesirable to raise prices now and again, says Cancer.
Statistically, the increase in general education in the second quarter of 2014 was only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
The retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is not clear how fast: while most restorators have been stocked for the next two months in the hope of waiting for price collapses.
But what happens in two months, nobody knows.
There are tens of tents decorated with greenery and wood in front of Moscow’s mayor.
In the center of the scene, musicians play waltzes.
It's a regional food festival called "There's Time."
"We've been planning a local food festival for a long time, and it's just sanctions, we're in a hurry, we've organized a festival," one of the organizers said.
Behind the music scene, Anastas cooks pasta salads and homemade confetti, there was a master class in the preparation of burgundy with caramelized apples.
All Russian products are assured by the organizers.
In tents is an exhibition of achievements of the Russian people's farm.
Honey from Bashkiria, deer from Salehard, vegetables from Lenin's Sub-Sovereign Soccer, cheese from Jay Clous.
“The salmon moose for restaurants can easily be replaced by another salmon fish from the Far East,” says fish bench owner Philip Galkin.
We've got a kidney, a whale, a roach, a seagull, a 'royal salmon'.
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon, because they're wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is the same aquaculture.
You take him in your hand, he doesn't even move.
And you can't hold our far-east salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace Italian mozzarella domestic
In the ceiling of his tent are shrimps with the burgundy "Magadan", cod, mule, muxon, Crimea mussels, Far East humps.
Galkin's sure it's a long time to go fishing from the Far East.
According to statistics, catches of fish in Russia in 2013 amount to more than 4 million tons, and a large proportion of fish go to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are about 800,000 tons.
The "Your People" bench has been operating since 2012, sells fish through the internet store, and has served another half a dozen restaurants, such as Simple Things, before the sanctions are imposed.
Galkin's applications have now been made since 15 restaurants.
We can make the same sushi out of our fish, it's hot.
We got weary, tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through an Internet store for a million roubles a month.
Our fish are a few times cheaper, and delivery is a maximum of 15 roubles per kilogram.
In support of the Galkina tent, I've got Philadelphia serving with the cat.
Unlike the roles of the seven, they have to chew longer, but the knowledge that this fish is our domestic strength.
On the site of the "Your People" there are even rolls of a coat and a sea bass.
In sushi bars, it is true that Chilean salmon prefer to be replaced by Norwegian salmon.
Galkin explains this by giving lazy cooks new recipes from the Far East fish.
“The Russian fish has not yet been offered to us by suppliers”, explains the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitri Essev.
About the same situation with other products: Russian producers could take up a free niche, but this is not the case.
According to the founder and co-owner of the Lavka Lavka Lavka Borisa Akimova project, it is now possible to talk more about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and large volumes.
They can quickly replace banned imports, unlike our farmers.
That is, the ban will be won first by major producers from other countries," says Akimov.
In the last month, however, the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
As a result of the massive out-of-range inspections of Rossabnadzor, three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
“We are examining the substance of the claims made to determine the actions necessary for the early opening of restaurants for visitors”, Denham stated in McDonald's press service.
No one really understands what's gonna happen next.
If everything is restricted to product sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, says an anonymous employee of a restaurant consulting company.
If they start shutting McDonald's all over the country, the script will be completely different.
Europrotocol instead of GUIDD reference
Casco payments can be obtained without a GIBDD reference - so the CB intends to stimulate the introduction of the “European around” in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft guidance that will allow an insured motorist to go unreported since 1 September of this year.
In fact, it is only when an accident was launched in a “European Europe” without the involvement of the road police.
That is, if only two vehicles were involved in the accident, there were no physically injured persons, no damage was greater than the specified limit, and both drivers agreed on who caused the accident.
Since 2 August, the “European around” payment limit has been 50,000 rubles, and will be increased to 400,000 rubles from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Moscow and Leningrad.
The point is that often even with minor injuries, in situations where a traffic accident can be formed in a “European environment”, drivers in an accident are called on by the DPS.
It was not possible to obtain a reimbursable helmet without reference to the GIDD if there was a helmet policy.
The parameters set out in the draft guidance are intended to remove this obstacle to the introduction of the “European around” in Russia.
According to them, the maximum premium on helmets for an unmanned accident should not be lower than the limit on “European Europe”.
However, it cannot be higher than the ceiling set out in the helmet insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically capable of unloading both DPS and road personnel.
But it is likely that neither motorists nor insurers will be thrilled by it.
The latter are already referring to a serious threat to the increase in fraud, which may result in the introduction of new helmet payment rules.
With regard to drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservativeism.
The driver will in most cases wait hours for the inspector to form a minor accident because it is more reliable.
It is not yet clear what will be easier to defeat fraud or convince drivers of the reliability of Europe.
Saving certificate shall be made authentic and irresistible
Minfin wants to ban savings certificates on the bearer, but will allow banks to make them an equivalent of an irresistible contribution.
Minfin is preparing a bill that will ban saving certificates for the bearer.
Recently, this tool has become popular, as rates here are higher than bank deposits.
The fact is that savings certificates on the forwarder do not fall into the insurance system, and the bank is costing them less, as there is no need to credit the Agency for Insurance of Deposits (AAV).
The intensity of the situation is that this step is planned because of small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates and will be affected by Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which are estimated to control 98 per cent of the profile market.
The share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the Agency, is about 3.5 per cent.
The problem explained in the ASA is that the clients of a small bank that purchased such a certificate are seeking to obtain money from the AAV if they withdraw their licence.
Some investors, lacking sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates for the applicant, may assume that their investments are insured.
Justifiable absence of insurance payments for these certificates if the licence is withdrawn from the bank may lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.
In the practice of the Agency, there have been cases in which the holders of the award certificates have attempted to obtain insurance compensation through the court," the ASA stated.
The problem, of course, is deliberate.
After all, no one will pay the buyers for the certificates, because they have no right under the law to compensation from the State.
If the case were to be that the instrument was not insured in the AAV, it would be prohibited, along with it, from the metal accounts on which the citizens ' funds are included in the grams of one of the four metals, gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts do not, however, enter into the insurance system, but they are not yet attempted.
The case is likely that the certificates for the bearer are a very convenient paper that can actually act as quasideneg.
However, their movement is virtually uncontrollable: any bank client can buy a certificate, transfer a certificate to any citizen, and before calculating such a certificate may replace many owners.
It is not an accident that the draft law provides that the savings certificate must be necessarily the exact document to be kept in the depositary.
In order to sweeten the pill to the banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right of early repayment.
That is, the equivalent of the irresistible contribution that bankers have long dreamed of.

Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will place arms in Iraq to counter the terrorist group “Islamic State” by referring to a decision taken following a meeting of Government representatives of the FRG, headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel, on 31 August.
Germany is reportedly sending 30 portable anti-tank missile complexes of Milan and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
The delivery will be completed by the end of September.
It was also decided to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel would make a public statement on the subject.
So far, Germany has not delivered its weapons to the hotspots.
The views of the people of the FWG on the sending of arms to Iraqis have been shared.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop fighters from the Islamic State, others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
The militia defeated a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea
The Donetsk militia overthrew the Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, ITAR-TAS reported on 31 August.
It is estimated that this occurred in Taganrog Bay near Shiroqino and Bezmený (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reported two coast guard boats being fired.
It is stated that the incident took place today at about 16:20 a.m.

Two alliances met
The Minsk summit negotiations did not address the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first European Union persons met with the first people of the future of Eurasian
On the issue of concern (the situation around Ukraine is not tolerated), EU and Customs Union leaders have for the first time discussed a number of “hot issues”.
Is such a structure capable of working effectively, incomprehensible; it is clear, however, who removed the plums from the summit.
Questions to that effect came to light on the evening of 26 August, when Belarusians, followed by other Europeans and Europeans, saw the new President Lukashenko on television.
The Belarusian leader set an example of outspoken courtesy, a man who had just been torn down by a Jackpot, and was planning a decent old age in a high society.
How Majdan Lukashenko helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European Commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to give a final briefing on their behalf, not just the legitimacy of the President with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for recognition by Minsk as a full subject of European policy and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies, Denise Meliantsov, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to speak to Minsk the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will be unfreezing further," he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for the break-in by the Belarusian authorities began long before November Maidan in Kiev in the summer of 2013.
“The results have been achieved, and with the EU, the successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, the dialogue on modernization, is listed by Fireka, and international security negotiations have been held with the United States.
The state even lifted some sanctions.
With regard to the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the response of the leadership of Belarus to them only inspired the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure has not recognized the accession of the Crimea to Russia and has called for the punishment of the pro-Russian militias in Donbass with all strictness, has failed to deal with Moscow as well.
Minsk did not leave the Customs Union or the ODCB, and the Russian airbase is located in Baranovic.
Brussels and Washington noted the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and assessed it, the Belarusian experts are confident.
The successful movement of Lukashenko towards political diversification will be seen as often in the near future, Minsk will have to meet in EU+TS format.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expects of relations in a new format.
Press Secretary Ashton Maja Kosyancic merely stated that the issue was not a priority in the light of war and peace issues.
It was reported that Kazakhstan could become the next meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
The deglay for Minsk became a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbaev, in which he admitted that he was personally requested by the representatives of the European Union.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties did not mind that Minsk should remain a central meeting point both in the form of Russia-OSCE-Ukraine and at the level of Heads of State and High Representatives of the European Commission.
This means that "the last dictator of Europe" has become a fully-managed European leader who has helped solve the global problem.
European Farmer’s Best Friend
The EU delegation itself, which included EU Commissioners for Trade and Energy, had drawn the conclusion: the main pillars of the summit are not the tragic situation at Donbassa, but the economy.
Indeed, the timetable for future negotiations on gas supplies at the meeting and for overcoming the concerns of the TC countries on an association agreement with the EU is more extensive than peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
However, the Commissioner for Trade Karl De Güht noted: EU representatives “have come to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis, which has economic consequences rather than vice versa”.
It seems, however, that the economic crisis in Ukraine is "working" for Belarus.
Its consequences, and especially the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia, have been given to Minsk, who has so far experienced the sanctions pressure, the long-awaited field of manoeuvre.
According to the head of the Mises Research Centre, ex-candidate to the Presidents of Belarus, Jaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in Belarus's ability to supply agriculture to the FF in the bypass of sanctions.
The supply schemes are being developed for which Vladimir Putin rushed Minsk to the summit.
“The initiators of these schemes,” stressed Romanchuk Ogońka, “are not Belarusian businessmen but Russian companies.
They have long worked out supply schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and these schemes have been destroyed today.
The Russian business needs something to restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is that many Ukrainian companies do not want to make production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials with Russian market orientation as well.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian trade schemes may now be very needed.”
In the view of Romanchuk, the role of host of the EU and TS negotiating site is ideal for Lukashenko and for the development of economic ties with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission is now offering only 125 million euros of compensation to agrarians.
The Belarusian President may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the effects on Eurofarers.
This could raise Lukashenko's EU authority to unprecedented heights.
Non-initiative hospitality
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the summit initiative.
But the paradox is that official Minsk has been re-opened from its active role in the birth of the TC+EC format, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with a Ukrainian colleague has stressed that he has initiated a new format and has become Kiev altogether.
"It was your suggestion to gather, without any urgency, to discuss, not with the Bay-Baracht to decide, after signing the EU Association Treaty, to address the situation that was at that time in Ukraine," he addressed the chambers to Peter Poroshenko.
On the other hand, the observers interpreted it as an attempt to calm Moscow, which was initially opposed to the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
In the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Belarus is careful to stress that the EU and TC on their land do not pursue beneficial goals, but the ultimate objective of such a format is to create a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
“It is in the spirit of the concepts that, in other spheres, in particular in the security field, have put forward and promoted the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation,” said Ogońka in the Belarus MIT, an agency where the words have been scrupulously selected lately.
In Moscow, there may be free entry zones
The Moscow Government is considering the introduction of pay entry zones as a method to combat the overcrowding of central roads, similar to other major cities in the world, and is transferring M24.ru, with reference to the Moscow Mayor of Transport Maksim Lixutov.
One option that has successfully proven itself is a paid entry.
It's an expert opinion, we'll have to study it, look at all the negatives and the positives.
To say that some decisions have been made so early," Lixutov explained.
Zammer stressed that it was very important for the capital authorities to have experience in Asian cities, which were similar to Moscow in structure and loading.
One of the decisions taken from those countries was the already implemented construction of the central ring road, added the Lixutov.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of not having to pass all traffic through Moscow.
If the infrastructure was sufficient, it was not necessary to have transit traffic in Moscow," the Mayor noted.
Maksim Lixutov also stated that the introduction of paid parking spaces had significantly decomposed the capital streets.
He said that the capital authorities were not planning to stop at what had been achieved.
Remember, on 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobianin, participated in the ceremony for the construction of the first launch complex of Moscow's Central Ring Road (CCAD).
Boringly wrong.
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodríguez, "The City of Sins 2: The woman for whom it is worth killing", has done quite the opposite of the revolution that could be expected of him.
The first City of Sin (2005), shot with minimal but symbolic participation by Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comic books and literary nuar.
Sikwell is also revolutionary: in the sense that it destroys the chain of “thesis - antithesis - synthesis” for modern thought, the chain of “thesis - synthesis” (if it means the universe nuara and, by antithesis, the space of comics).
It should now read “thesis - antithesis - chaos”.
"Gown of Sins-2" is chaotic both at the dramatic and philosophical levels: it is both chaotic in a foolish sense of the word.
Yes, part of the characters are known for the first City, although, here, Marv (Micky Rourke) is struck, remember, he ended his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, nothing, but manages to extract, in the role of the folk's mate, from the air of the knife and the other carpets with the stranglers.
But the old people are literally pushing their elbows at new women, like breaking into a city from some other movie, about the meaning and the plot of which the viewers are asking not to worry.
So, his story, shamelessly overturned by the authors in the most interesting place, by the super-successful player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
His own is the lustful, frigid Eva Lord, Eva Green, and something vengeful about Dwight.
But this confusion, in which we say that it's no different to Johnny's face than the fact that faces, like other parts of the body, are subjected to unrelenting regularity, not trouble or failure.
They're not people, but we understand that this is the archetyping of nuara: a rock bitch who's too confident of herself as a player who's into the "honey trap" of sex detective, a corrupt sonar.
Well, when an archetype waltzes with an archetype and an archetype drives, it's not a movie anymore, but read that it's an abstract painting.
And asking abstract paintings about the logic of the story is funny.
Besides, even in this boring world, there's something permanent.
The First City fighting whores continue to hold a round defense against the dwarves of their native dark forces.
Yeah, and Detective Hartigan's ghost isn't, and she's gonna look at the light, and it's always nice to see Bruce Willis.
The main problem of Sin City-2 is another.
Frank Miller was good because as a painter, he was talented in combining the comic book and the New Year, and as director, he turned the idea of how to move comics to the screen.
Comic and nuar are two aggressively opposite "realities".
The comic book phenomenon was born in the late 1920s, when Dashil Hammett's novels "Blood Harvest" (1929), "Maltian Falcon" (1930) and "Glass Key" (1931) created a canon of nuara, then known as the hard-boiled school, "the cool school".
Well or pulp fiction.
The comics gave Hollywood dozens of heroes: from Popeye's seafarer, the spinach eater, the superman, Batman, and Dick Tracy to the Hulk, Thor, the Spider-Man and the other avengers.
But in any movie based on comics, there was something that was damaged: the characters that were painted were persistently unwilling to corrode the screen flesh, and remained a feignor in the natural will of their “real” world.
Simply put, they were totally devoid of "existence."
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the wars of the world, a traditional novel, with experiences, personalities, family scandals and a historical background, has lost all credibility.
Which Forsyths, which Tibo and Rugon Makkari, which even Bolkonsky and Rostov are thought of after Verden, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel was peacefully mutated in the form of a soap opera, and the criminal, by definition marginal, rose to the level of the philosophical prose.
Hammett found out on his skin what it was like to work as a paramedic on the front.
He was a communist.
By the way, they were, at least, close to the committee and such pillars as the writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, the directors of Jules Dassen, Joseph Louzi, Edward Dmitrick.
So nuar, whose archetype they set, first, is rude and cynical, and secondly, is purely social.
This is almost an American version of socialism.
The first City of Sins was remarkable precisely because it was unnatural but organically linked the comic book to the nuor.
For the first time on the screen, the comic was revived, not by being ashamed of its graphic nature, but by pretending to be the "real" film.
The darkness of the selling world, where the cardinal ordered murder, and the senator covering the monstrous Sadist son, was quite worthy of Hammett's pen.
And the vivid details of the kind of decapitated heads that the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the genius James Elroy, the author of the Black Orchid and the best -- that is, the declarative -- the representative of neonura.
The City of Sins-2 is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of Miller-Rodrigues radical stylistics before the comic book tradition.
It must have happened because of 3D technology in a lot of ways.
When you look at the second City of Sins, you feel trapped in a glass balloon where the snow is falling asleep in a toy lock.
Most of the time, it's not snow, it's blood stains, but what difference does it make?
It's about social security and not talking about anything.
Because it's only possible when somewhere, somewhere, we have some dirt mud on the side of the mud, but there's a normal world where you can turn back the girl's curved track or tell the restless parents that her executioner is punished.
But when there is no sin in the city except sin, there is no sin, nor sin any more, but the law.
Boring as any norm.
The chaos of Sin City-2 is just boring.
For the sake of domestic justice, he gave this fresh sin a small but small glove.
Titres are warned: the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
With respect to the sight in the most vegetarian episode of which the man's fingers are broken, it gives him hell's humor.
Hammett would love it.
The Socialists of France must “close and bring France to order”, says key ally of Frasua Ollanda
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left forces to “show a warm attitude” to the attacked Socialist President, whose alterations had not been approved by the overwhelming majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay close to him," he said, applauding.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister believed that his Government would not question a controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite inciting conflict proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Makron, the new Minister of Economy, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Alland begged his Socialist Party comrades to remain “one” with the Government.
However, Christian Tobera, the Minister of Justice, put sticks in the wheels, attending a meeting of dissensive members of Parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “los their faith in the future”.
Marin Le Pe, the leader of the extremely right-wing National Front, voiced contempt for permanent internal conflicts among socialists, said that she did not believe that the new Government of Walla would last longer than a few months.
François Alland is a bare king, but naked and Prince Manuel Wall, forced to gather a new government when the previous one did not last the summer.
"And the new one won't last the fall or the winter," said Mrs. Penn to the reporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of parliament, said she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and be ready to govern.
The French ruling party was defeated in the March municipal elections, and the extremely right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A poll by the Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of the French believed that the Socialist Party risked dissipating into several rival factions by the end of Mr. Alland's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at the University of Lights Poe, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to repair the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but public opinion must quickly feel that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"A city without drugs" left without a warrant
The Sverdlov arbitration tribunal has left the claim for the direction of the Regional Ministry of State Administration to the City Without Drugs Foundation.
The Board intended to collect more than 7 million rubies from the organization as a rental fee for a building in the centre of Ekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear twice in court.
Today, the Sverdlovsk arbitration court has left the claim of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the region (IPGISO) to the City Without Drugs Foundation (one of the founders, the mayor of Ekaterinburg, Evgeny Royzman).
The regional authorities intended to collect 7.3 million roubles as rental fees for the building.
Today, it was known that the plaintiff had not appeared twice before the court, which led to the decision to refuse.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the MUGISO Directorate was not clear, and the head of the legal department, Maxim Titov, did not respond to telephone calls.
The Fund has also been unable to contact.
Remember, it's a mansion that's held a fund downtown on Belinsky Street, 19 on a free basis since 2011.
This decision was taken by ex-governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, Sverdlovska District Public Property Administration Directorate filed a complaint with Sverdlovski arbitral tribunal on the expulsion of the fund from the building.
According to the suit, the department had requested the court to grant non-contained contracts free of charge to a monumental mansion.
According to the MUGISO Directorate, the agreement did not contain significant terms for the lease of the cultural heritage site.
The Sverdlov arbitration court dismissed the claim, and an appeal was filed with the 17th Arbitral Court of Permi, which was granted.
The same court then filed an appeal in cassation against the decision, which was left unanswered, after which the decision was appealed by the fund to the Supreme Court of Arbitration, but the court took a party to the administration.
A new lease was concluded in 2013, after which the fund began to pay rent again, as told by the head of Eugeni Royzman.
The rent was paid 300,000 rubles a month.
The previous administration of the area transferred this building to us free of charge, recognizing our merit in the fight against drugs, as a tribute to the fund.
The current administration decided otherwise," he said.
Tatiana Drogeva, Ekaterinburg
Why the Mayor of Ekaterinburg was offered to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, Ekaterinburg's hormone deputy, Alexander Kosintsev, invited the mayor of the city, the Speaker of the Gormud, Eugenia Royzman, to resign.
A criminal case involving an arrest suspect in the murder of a retired member of the pride of Oleg Kinev, who is considered an associate of the mayor.
How Eugenia Roysman Found a Criminal Case
On 1 July, it became known that a criminal case had been initiated on defamation (art. 128.1 of the Criminal Code) in the blog of the Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Eugenia Royzman.
This was reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs on Sverdlovsk Region, where Anna Filatov, Director of the Legal Centre for Protection, made a statement.
According to her, Mr. Royzman accused her of her blog records of being involved in crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Ekaterinburg is convinced that this is another attempt to avenge the truth.
iPhone turn into a wallet
In the run-up to 9 September, when Apple is due to present its new developments, there is a growing trend in the press about what can be expected of the presentation.
With reference to sources, American media reported that the sixth generation of iPhones would be equipped with a mobile phone function as a result of the Apple joint project and Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Re/code Internet resource, the new product presentation on 9 September Apple may, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, making the mobile wallet function available in the new iPhone 6 smartphone.
Companies themselves have rejected any comments on this matter.
This function allows you to pay at the store's cashier with the help of a smartphone.
Payment identification will be made by the user using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will first incorporate the NFC (near field communication) technology, which allows you to make an uncontacted payment using the smartphone and the corresponding reading device on the cassette.
The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (former Philips Semiconductors).
For the first time, the NFC function was presented in 2004 through the cooperation of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that entered the so-called NFC Forum, the Association for the Promotion of Technology.
The first telephone with NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first smartphone for Android with the function of NFC - Samsung Nexus S - was presented in 2010.
In May 2011, Google presented Google Wallet to allow users to attach bank cards to their Google account and to pay for Android smartphones.
Moreover, the United States experts stress that, despite large investments by high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, U.S. retailers are still cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on the equipment of their stores by such systems.
The observers therefore hope that Apple's entry into the market will still lead the drivers to accelerate and more actively implement this technology at their trading venues.
MED France: Paris' position on deliveries to Russia "Mistrale" does not change
The official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France, Romen Nadal, stated that Paris had maintained its position on the supply of Mistral helicopter carriers to Russia.
“I may recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (France Alland) in his interview with Le Monde on 20 August: “The current level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
This is a European decision, not France," Mr. Nadal "RIA Novosti" quotes.
Thus, the representative of the French foreign policy department replied to the question whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would affect the change in Paris' position to implement the contract
For more details on the delivery of helicopter carriers to Russia, see the material of the magazine "Ogonek" "Mistral" almost ours.
Ukrainian National Security Council: Seven military personnel have been killed in the last days in the zone of force
The representative of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Andrey Lysenko, reported that seven Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the fighting zone in the east of the country, and another 25 had been injured.
The situation under Ilovaysky is extremely difficult.

Loss data will be made public at the end of the transaction and the causes of the situation.
The perpetrators of such a situation would be responsible," Mr. Lysenko added, refusing to discuss in more detail the situation under Ilowaysk, where several Ukrainian battalions fell into the environment.
According to the representative of the SNAB, “every effort is being made to return the prisoners”, the ITAR-TASS reported.
Mr. Lysenko also noted that Ukrainian military personnel had departed from Lugansk airport towards the settlement point of Georgievka.

Norwegian Cruise approaches the $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is at the final stage of negotiations to acquire a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to cruise ships of the class “lux” and secured clients of Prestige Cruises, as it competes with the larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could already be announced this week, sources reported on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
Sources asked to remain untitled, as negotiations were not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 per cent higher than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brands of Oceania and Regent, which are jointly owned by eight cruise vessels operating in Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She claimed income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than the year before.
The 29 billion-billion-dollar cruise industry is expected to benefit from the middle-class growth in developing economies, such as China and India in subsequent years.
The racing companies seek to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered in the US governing bodies for primary public stock placement in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's main shareholder after $850 million in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it now exists in 2000 as a result of a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and a casino under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thei.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting had a share of 28 per cent, Apollo had a 20 per cent share, and the private investment company TPG Capital LP had a share of 8 per cent in the company, as reported at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of the cruise route in North America, according to registration documents at the first public location of Prestige Cruises shares.

Hong Kong Democratic Movement Activists Disengage a Chinese representative on the day following election decision
A group of Beijing loyal citizens stood near the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Assembly established a procedure whereby only two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the elections of the Head of Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the support of most members of the nomination committee, which is likely to be filled with Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to go to the ballot and force democratic activists to renew their promise to stop Hong Kong's financial centre by protesting Occupy Central.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will be extended to other cities.
Following Beijing's publication of a document describing China's control of Hong Kong, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region in June, and hundreds of thousands went to the city's business centre and held a sit-in.
Leigh briefing is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Bureau in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the National People's Assembly of each of the People's Representatives, Jang Rongshung, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao State Council, Feng Wei, were also scheduled to give a series of briefings during the day.
Activist students said they would gather at the Hong Kong Government building in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to join 400 hectares of Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities announced their intention to join 400 hectares of land on the west coast of the Jordan River, belonging to Palestinian autonomy.
According to the BBC, the decision to join the country by South Bethlehem is linked to the desire to pay for the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
Israel ' s Ministry of Defence claimed the Territory on Sunday and commissioned the military to establish an administrative office on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saiba Arikat, the world public must call on Israel to respond to “the continuing settlement activity on the West Bank of Jordan and East Jerusalem”.
Putin requires Kiev to start negotiations on “Statehood” in eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports about his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Sunday that the Ukrainian Government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on “Statehood” of a separate region.
His Spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, later explained that Putin had no intention of implying that the Eastern Ukrainian territory would become part of Russia's control of separatists, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be revised to enable the Russian-speaking region to defend its rights and interests.
However, Putin ' s appeal to the Kiev Government to begin negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels was equal to the obvious strategy that it followed five months ago from the start of the bloodshed: to help the separatists to take the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossiya de facto independence in order to get closer to Russia, not the West.
In an interview with the State's First Television Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return secessionists in eastern Donetsk and Lugansk areas, which were captured in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently named the captured territories of Novorossia, or New Russia, which refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peace talks will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian policies begin campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October, and while government forces attack peaceful settlements in secessionary regions, the Illusion Planner reported to ITAR-TASS.
“We must immediately begin substantive negotiations and not only on technical matters, but also on the political system of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine to meet the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin ' s words on Statehood were in mind in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussed for months with the leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas, that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Sandov said.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict”.
The intervention of the Kremlin press secretary to correct “the incorrect interpretation” of Putin's words emphasized the decision of the Russian leadership to act against the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than the open seizure of the Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had to endure a much harder battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugansk regions of eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million people were not Russian, and interviews prior to the conflict showed broad support for staying within Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, essentially passing on to the Kremlin actual control over the territory that would link Russia's main territory to the Crimea.
On the Black Sea peninsula, which was joined five months ago, is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historical maritime resorts.
In regions between Russia's Rostov Region and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and Lithuanian factories that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Peter Poroshenko proposed, during his inaugural speech on 7 June, that Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, take into account amendments to the constitution, allowing for greater control of their finances and language status in the regions.
However, his view of autonomy appears to differ greatly from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, who are accused of Moscow in arms and incitement.
The latest call by Putin to Kiev to agree with separatist leaders, as equals, has followed the new insurgent attacks last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from the pre-peaceful area along the Azov Sea.
Russian-backed separatists have taken control of the city of Novoazovsk on an onset of which Ukrainian security officials say they fear it is the start of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory to the Crimea.
This has resulted in extensive civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port from 500,000 inhabitants, between the New Asia Strip and the narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poraenko called on Saturday for the European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which was independent for 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of non-return," Porzenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any action; leaders have called for a draft of more severe sanctions against Russia, which will be adopted in the event of an escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovyska after two convoys of Russian armoury and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the difficult separatists, Colonel Andry Lysenko, the press secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine informed reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly detained in Ilovaysk as a result of the Russian invasion was exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airmen captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lisenko reported on Sunday.
A naked scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gaby Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his disdain for the hackers who may have stolen the naked photos of his bride, Gabi Greco, and the entire list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood in outrage after a series of frank photographs depicting the naked Jennifer Lawrence have been caught on the Internet as a result of a massive hacker scandal with celebrities.
The hacker responsible for this is said to have about 60 revealed photos of the Golden Games by Lawrence and the superstars, including the models of Kate Upton and Kara Deleven, the singers Ryanna, Ariana Grande and Leah Michel and actress Kirsten Danst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Zárovski, and a resident in Melbourne, Greco, were also suspected to have stolen photographs as a result of an escape from iCloud.
In list 101, the name of the celebrities.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, said, "This is disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs should remain private.
It's terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent out to other people.
Greco, who is in New York City, reportedly told the news website that the hacker's attack was "proud" and that those to whom it was directed "feel that they were being invaded".
The hacker is supposed to have 30 photos of Palmer with a former boyfriend named Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying in the pool with her naked chest.
Palmer's films include "Love and Honor" together with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck's star, and the actress at Browning's Prohibited Reception, didn't comment on stolen photos yesterday.
The representative of Lawrence said TMZ, "This is a sudden invasion of private life."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his disdain for the hacker, tweeted, "Exposing photographs stolen from a mobile phone is really no different than selling stolen goods."
From a legal point of view, we cannot tolerate the publication of stolen photographs.
Potential way of stealing photos of naked celebrities detected
A massive break-in of star accounts may be caused by vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
The potential scenario of events described the resource The Next Web.
A Python script was published on Github resource, allowing you to choose passwords for the Apple Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the iPhone location.
The same link between the login and the Apple ID password is used to access the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed the override method to learn the password from Find My Phone.
This method consistently introduces all possible combinations of symbols, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that the number of passwords entered was unlimited in the Find My Phone service.
If the security system is properly organized after several failed attempts to enter the wrong account password, the account must be blocked and the user must be informed of the break-in.
Because of vulnerability, users have not received any reports of attempts to access their account password.
The hackers recognized the Apple ID password and used it to access iCloud.
According to Hackapp's Twitter user, the vulnerability was detected two days ago on Saturday and was written by a password-gathering script program.
Vulnerability is currently closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the user of Hackapp and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability was characteristic of many services, but noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability was used to access the “star” account.
It's not me, it's RT.
On Twitter, the Prime Minister again came up with foreign records
Although there is no solid evidence that vulnerability was used in the Find My Phone to steal photographs, there was a wave of harmful actions using this service.
The hackers intercepted the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In the case of Apple, the media stated that cloud safety had not been compromised in this case, but had not investigated how users had lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Twitterist of RF Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev had also been hacked before.
If the intruders had access to iCloud as described above, there could also be a password for the head of government account in the microblogging service.
The Next Web could not get Apple's comments on vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to Ukrainian five-party
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anne Burak.
The relevant decree is published on the Internet portal of legal information.
At the beginning of this year, the athlete moved to Russia for a permanent residence and asked the Federation for an opportunity to support a collective RF.
In 2013, she won two stages of the World Cup, won the European Silver Medal in personal primacy, and became the world champion in a mixed stage, which is one of the new types of sport programme.
It also holds leading positions during the current season.
Under the rules, she will need special permission from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine to speak at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Anna Burjak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change her nationality.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian chessist, Ekaterina Lagno-born Lviv, who is a two-time champion of Europe (2005), 2008, flash world (2010) and quick chess (2014).
In Ukraine's women's team, the sportswoman won the chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the world's team champion in Astana (2013) and the European Command Championship in Warsaw (2013).
SCR stopped investigating the Tu-204 disaster in Vnukovo
The Russian Investigative Committee (PAC) has terminated the criminal case of the crash of the Tu-204 Air Force Red Wings.
This is reported by the department's press service.
The decision was made in connection with the death of the commander of the aircraft and of the ship's lorry.
The forensics showed that the disaster caused an increased rate of landing, failure by crews to meet standard landing procedures, as well as unintended engine outflows to increased direct traffic.
The flight Tu-204 by Red Wings, followed by a flight of Prague-Moscow, was demolished on 29 December 2012 when landing at the Vnukovo Moscow airport.
The aircraft climbed over the runway and burned.
At the scene, an aircraft commander, a second pilot and a bottinger were killed.
Two onboard drivers were taken to medical facilities, where they later died from injuries.
Three more onboard drivers hospitalized with severe bodily injuries were treated for long periods of time.
In addition, the driver of the vehicle was seriously injured at the time of the crash on the Kiev Highway.
There were no passengers aboard the aircraft.
The transport procurator ' s office carried out a check in Red Wings after the crash, which revealed numerous violations.
In February 2013, the airline licence was suspended.
The company resumed operation in summer 2013.
Alexander Emilianenko started training at SISO
A prominent Russian mixed-style fighter, 33-year-old Alexander Emelianenko, who is at SISO for sexual assault against a female worker, has recovered completely from the injuries and has begun to train.
This is reported by the Champion.
In May of this year, the Russian Investigative Committee charged Alexandra Emilianenko with rape.
The suspect was declared wanted and detained in Tambova on 9 May following a traffic accident that resulted in a hip fracture.
Emilienko Jr. was placed under arrest until 31 August, a sentence was ordered on 1 September.
However, the court was transferred and the investigation demanded an extension of detention until 30 September.
In case an athlete's guilt is proven, he is in danger of imprisonment for up to six years.
What's the power, brother?
Lenta.ru remembers the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emilianenko's career
Emilianenko spent his last unit in January of this year, losing a technical knockout to a fellow countryman named Dmitri Sosnovsky.
Alexander is the younger brother of Fedor's better known fighter, Emilianenko.
The latter is the four-time world championship of mixed martial arts, the four-time world champion and Russia's seven-time combat samba champion.
Anger has proved to be the most universal and functional emotion of the human person
The serrated expression of a person is biologically universal to humankind, and every organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not an accident, but is an additional means of expression of power and threat, scientists from Australia and the United States have discovered.
They described their discoveries in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and they were briefly read about in the press release of the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face is that of the raised and abandoned eyebrows stretched out in the thin line of the lips, the dilated nostrils in all cultures, and is made even by the blind children who have never seen them since birth, notes the leading author of the study, Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion has emerged for the effective handling of disputes during conflict.
The more a person is able to inflict physical harm on another person, the more he is able to dictate his circumstances, and the more he brings it to an interviewer by means of anger.
Researchers have also found evidence of another hypothesis: physically strong people are more angry and adapt, believe that they are entitled to impose adverse conditions on others, and prefer strong methods of conflict resolution to peaceful ones.
In response to the fact that anger is first of all “trafficking emotion”, scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create an angry expression should represent the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interviewer - and thus make him agree to his terms in order to avoid conflict as soon as possible.
To verify this hypothesis, researchers have modelled on the computer the person who had or was absent from each of the seven elements of the angry person and have shown them to the informers.
Although abandoned eyebrows or chins advanced separately did not make the person evil, the more powerful physical participants in the study accepted the individual’s characteristics in unanimity.
Man ' s anger, like that of animals, is a threat: an exaggerated display of self-force, forced to accept and obey.
The man rips his nostrils and lifts his lips for the same purpose as the lagoon that blows up, or the baboon who shows his clicks.
“The anger is “started” by the interlocutor’s refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form that best demonstrates to the opposite party the consequences of the refusal.
But the most striking - that none of the elements of the angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same," said anthropologist John Tubi.
Mincoms offered to allocate 250 million roubles to Crimea TV.
Mincoms proposed that 250 million roubles of an autonomous non-profit organization, Crimea, be allocated from the federal budget in 2014.
This is referred to in the draft Government decision prepared by the department with which Lenta.ru was consulted.
According to the explanatory note to the project, the federal budget grants would be directed “to cover the costs of creating conditions for extensive information on the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment”.
In particular, it is planned to re-engineer the studio, the video walls, the central hardware and the video server.
It is also planned to acquire a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter.
In addition, from the funds allocated, the company will pay for the use of fibre-optic communications (WOLS) and for the renovation of the energy system.
Grants will be provided within the federal budget provided for the Mincomlink.
The State Broadcasting Company Crime was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, over 75 per cent of the peninsula is covered by television broadcasting.
In 2011, Krym Teleradio was licensed to broadcast digital television.
