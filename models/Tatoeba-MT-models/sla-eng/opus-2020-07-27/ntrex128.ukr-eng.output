Members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that they will “associate with the maps”
Some U.S. is horrified by the recommendation to change the name of their office to “member of the Welsh Parliament” (MWP).
This recommendation came through plans to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament Wales.
AT THE end of the political spectrum, the concern is that it can cause ridicule.
One of the Labour Departments stated that his group was concerned about the Twp and Pwp rhymes.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "insane", and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
CA from the Welsa Party stated that its group as a whole was “unsatisfied” and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservatives said that his group was “unbiased” to change the name, but noted that the MWP could quickly become a “mapppet”.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently developing legislation to change names, noted: "The remaining decision on the new name of the members of the assembly will certainly be made by the members themselves."
Since 2017, the Welsh Self - Rule Act has given Wales the right to change its name.
In June the commission published the results of a public consultation of proposals, and the renaming of the Assembly to Parliament of Wales received wide support.
As to what to call the CA, the Commission proposes to call them “members of the Welsa Parliament”, or the WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest support from the public.
Of course, the C.A. offers alternatives, but trying to reach agreement can cause problems for Chairman Elin Jones, who should submit a bill of amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules on the removal of the CA and the structure of the committee system.
THE U.S. will hold a final vote on their new name when the legislation is discussed.
Macedonians go to vote in referendum on changing country names
On Sunday, voters are voting on whether to change the country’s name to “Republic of Northern Macedonia”.
The vote was organized to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim in Greece, and has repeatedly spoken against Macedonia’s EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposes holding a referendum on a change of name, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that changing the name is simply a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are silent because the Harlem Church is having a difficult time.
“The old people I was talking to say there used to be a bar and a church here on every corner,” said Mr. Adams. “
Now there is neither one nor the other."
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood as follows:
"In our time, people are socializing differently.
The bars are no longer the same as the local living room where they regularly go."
As for the churches, Adams fears that money from the sale of assets will not be long enough as leaders are expected to, and “ sooner or later they will be where they started. ”
Churches, he added, can replace houses with condominiums, and there will be people who will not help the saints who remain nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white, ” explained Adams, “so it will speed up the day when all these churches close because it is unlikely that most of those who move to condominiums will become their followers.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870 and Saint-Marten was built ten years later.
The indigenous white Methodist community moved out of here in the 1930s.
A black community that held rituals nearby was granted ownership of the building.
St. Martin moved into a black community led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main Merchant Street of Harlem, and these merchants didn't want to hire black people and promote them by service.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged, but Father Johnson’s parishioners wanted to rebuild it and set up a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly referred to the carillon as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it another “cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
This expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also noted that this was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician named Dionysio A. Linde, who turned 18 years ago into a bigger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merriveser, Saint-Martena has no replacement for him.
What's been going on in Saint-Martena over the last few months is a complicated story about architects and contractors, some of them being involved by church leaders, others being the bishop's diocese.
The Council is the governing body of the parish, which consists of the Miryan leaders, wrote in July that the diocese is concerned that the diocese “will seek to pass expenses” is glad that the council did not take part in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark traumatized a 13-year-old boy who dived in California's lobbying
According to the officials, on Saturday the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him, and the boy dived behind the lobbies in California on the opening day of the lobby season.
The attack took place at about 7 a.m. at Beekon Beach in Enzynitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour when he heard that the boy was crying for help, and along with the group went to him to get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought it was just a delight to have caught a lobbyist, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, "I've been bitten!
They tasted me!»
As soon as he got to the boy, he saw that his key was completely severed.
"I shouted to all to get them out of the water, "In the water of the shark!" added Hammel.
The boy was taken to a riflewing at the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
The rescue captain, Larry Giles, told the media that a few weeks ago, a shark was spotted in the area, but it wasn't found to be dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to the upper torso.
For the purpose of investigation and security, the authorities for 48 hours blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Enzynitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to go to the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury's going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using cosmetic islands similar to those in universities.
As part of an enhanced exit to the British cosmetics market of 2.8 billion pounds of sterling (continues to increase at the time when the sales volume of clothing and goods for the house decreases) the increased islands with cosmetics will be protested in 11 stores throughout the country.
The investments in cosmetics are related to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space that used to be used under televisions, microwave ovens, and goods for home.
In Sainsbury's stated that they would double the range of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, among which would be the first to produce brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space: brand areas, like those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also updates the range of cosmetics Boutique: most of the goods represented will not be protested on animals, which young buyers increasingly demand.
In addition, Fragrance Shop's retailer protestes his trays in two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, North London, last week, and the second one opens in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and buying small amounts of food every day in small stores forces supermarkets to make extra efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, claimed that their stores would become more like universities, because the network of supermarkets is trying to counter Aldi and Lidl's discos with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opening the Argos department in hundreds of their stores, also opened a number of Habitats departments. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claimed that it increased the sales of food products and also made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to upgrade cosmetics and pharmaceutical products has failed.
Sainsbury's tested cooperation with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over how to split the income from drugstores in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold their pharmaceutical business (281 pharmacies) to Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds sterling three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an expanded range of luxury skin brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, stated: "We have changed the appearance of our cosmetic islands to make the atmosphere more pleasant for customers.
We also invested in specially trained consultants who could offer advice.
The range of brands that we present is called to meet any needs, and the pleasant atmosphere and comfortable locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which makes it competitive to the old way to buy."
Peter Jones "strapped" because Holly Willoughby got out of a contract worth £11 million.
The Star of the League of Dragons Peter Jones "dispersed" because TV broadcaster Holly Willoughby left the deal with his brand of goods for life (the value of the deal is £11 million) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for a brand of home clothes and Truly accessories.
The business of the couple was connected to Goop Guinea Peltrow's brand.
This Morning, a 37-year-old executive, announced her entry into Instagram.
Holly Willoughby led the League Dragon star Peter Jones to the story of when at the last moment they came out of their profitable business of living goods to focus on new convenient contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones "dispersed", when a gold girl from TV confessed during a tense meeting Tuesday at Jones's headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new contract is worth £1.5 million, which means she doesn't have enough time to dedicate her to their common brand of household clothes and Truly accessories.
This business was connected to Goop Guinea Peltrow's brand and had to double Willoughby's stock, which is estimated at £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby informed Instagram that she was coming from Truly, Jones flew out of Great Britain to one of her holiday homes.
The source reported: “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s top priority.
He was to become its long - term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to quit the business shocked all the interested parties.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, almost the day before the launch.
The headquarters in Marlowe is full of stuff ready for sale.
Experts believe that this Morning, one of Britain’s most highly paid stars, could have cost companies millions through large investment in goods (from pillows and candles to clothes and household clothes) and created further delays with launch.
This can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Kapp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of government in March.
The money was held together during the holidays, Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s shares in television production.
Willoughby's going to be M&S ambassador and replace Anthony Macpartlin as lead I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source approaching Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his affairs."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism he would receive from news media as a comment that someone would consider “non-presidential” and also as a very positive attitude towards North Korea's leader.
"Why did President Trump go to such great things? "
said Trump, imitating the leader’s voice. —
I didn't go for any concessions."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step toward North Korea’s denuclearization.
But the negotiations on denuclearization went to a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s leading North Korean diplomat Ri Young Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “appropriate response” from the United States for its first steps of disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues to support pressure.
While giving a talk at his rally, Trump was much more optimistic.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea," he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions would have been killed.
Now we have such a wonderful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results: completion of missile trials, release of hostages, and return of the remains of American military personnel to their homes.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act as president, but instead of the 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this battle-filled stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there,” said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the Lombac earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that no help was needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lomboki’s population suffered, the national catastrophe was not announced, and this is a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is a little difficult," said Mrs. Sumbun.
Although Save the Children, he is gathering a team to travel to Pal until it is known whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, representative of the National Disaster Management Agency, stated that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palo to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
In view of the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for nature’s anger.
Tsunami shelters are built in Acech Province, but they are not characteristic of other shores.
The obvious absence of a siren warning about the Tsunami in Pala, although the warning was effective, likely contributed to death.
Moving among the countless Indonesian islands is not even in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A medical ship in Lomboca to treat the victims of the earthquake sails to Palo, but to reach the site of the new disaster will be able to reach at least three days later.
President Joko Vidodo made improvements in Indonesia’s infrastructure the basis of his election campaign and increased the cost of roads and railways.
But the funding deficit created problems for Mr. Joko's administration, who plans to change in the next year.
Mr. Joko is also hampered by prolonged interfaith enmity in parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority chose a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people died, tens of thousands displaced from their homes as a result of opposition from Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machete, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

A police officer confirmed that the woman whose body was found was resident of Birkenhead and was found in a house.
Today, in the afternoon, friends who believe to know a woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have stated that they are now informing the closest relatives of the victim.

Cromwell's statue near Parliament becomes a new monument that suffers from “rewriting history”
The removal of the statue would be a well-deserved payment for destruction in the Taliban style of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, which were carried out by its fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell community called Mr. Creek's proposal "stupid" and "the effort to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, said: “In view of the current debate on the decommissioning of the statue, the fact that Oliver Cromwell's statue at the Westminster Palace will become a target was inevitable.”
The iconocracy during English civil wars was not carried out either by Cromwell himself or by his command.
It is likely that Cromwell will be undeservedly sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The great statue of Cromwell sculptor William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testimony to the moods of the 19th century and part of the history of the figure that many think is still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many probably more at the end of the 19th century than now, Cromwell considers the parliament's advocate of external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Is such an idea quite accurate — the subject of the historical debates that are going on?
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the famous figures that represents one side of this conflict.
Its achievements as Lord Protector should also be celebrated and honored.”
Killer pig destroyed a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
A man identified only by the name Yuan was found dead in blood with a severed artery near a pigsty in a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In Sinina, the province of Qinghai, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig is going to be vaccinated with pigs in a pigsty.
On Wednesday, he is reported to have left with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the brother found him dead and saw that the door of the pigsty had been opened.
The brother pointed out that the pigsty had a large cauldron of blood on its mouth.
Forensics confirmed that a 249-pound cab damaged the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were in the blood and deformed, ” stated a cousin of the victim named Wu, quoted Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Juana or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that when the police collected evidence at the scene, the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking people.
Seven of me, Juanya and the market administration, are reportedly discussing compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and traumatized a man.
Ten years earlier, the pig weighed 295 kg to keep the Welsh farmer pressed against the tractor until the farmer’s wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba claimed that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood may be “trigger. ”
"They're just playful.
They're like children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with proper respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa’s remains will bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken by moving over the more cool waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring rain with floods north of Mexico and southwest of the United States.
Rose had winds at a speed of 137 km per hour (this is a hurricane of category 1), standing at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa is expected to head north.
In the meantime, the Pacific is beginning to form a pond that moves east to the west coast of the United States, and when Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California as a tropical storm on Monday, it will start pushing its tropical humidity northward to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will produce up to 25.4 cm [25.4 cm] of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical humidity that interacts with the nearby deposits will create strong rainwaters in the southwest.
In this area, between 2.54 and 10.2 cm [1.2 cm] of rain, dangerous floods, garbage floods, and the possibility of desert landslides.
Heavy tropical humidity will lead to an increase in rainfall from 5 to 7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5–10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southern west, especially in a large area of Arizona.
Rainwater floods are possible when conditions deteriorate rapidly because of the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly recommended that we do not go to the desert on foot, for tropical rains are possible.
Heavy rain may make canyons roaring rivers, and thunderstorms will bring storms and storms to this area.
In some parts of the northern coast of California, heavy rains can be caused by close proximity to the pond.
The amount of rainfall can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause insufferable streams of garbage and slippery roads.
It's going to be the first rainy season in the region.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and morning, and on Monday and Tuesday evening, the rain will become more extensive.
It's going to rain a lot over the Fore Corners from Tuesday through Wednesday.
In October there may be intense temperatures in all parts of the United States as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain warm enough.
This can lead to extreme temperature changes at short intervals.
On Sunday, we will see a fine example of extreme temperatures in the center of the United States.
It's almost a 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the summer heat will try to return and expand again.
In a large area of the center and east of the United States, heat is expected until October, and temperatures from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast are expected to be 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 12 degrees Celsius above average temperature.
According to our long - term weather forecast, there is a high probability that the average temperatures in the eastern United States will rise in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people observed hearing in Brett Kavanaugh case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television networks watched exciting testimony from a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence that occurred in the 1980s.
Political opposition continued, the channels interrupted planned programs to report on Friday's latest news: a deal prepared by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake about a one-week investigation into the indictment.
Ford informed the Senate Court Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was sucking her drunk and trying to get her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his emotional testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this was not the case.
It's possible that on Friday, more than 20.4 million people were watching this, as reported by the research company Nielsen.
The company calculated the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
You couldn't get the numbers immediately on other networks that also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems measuring the number of people watching TV in offices.
To compare, such an audience is similar in size to an audience that is watching a playoff or Oscar game.
Fox News Channel, whose leading show of thought strongly supported Kavanaugh's assignment, was the leader of all channels during the hearing that lasted all day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, was recorded in Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, CNN had 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake became the central figure of Friday's drama.
The office of this moderate republican issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, and then on Friday morning, CNN and CBS recorded the protesters shouting at Flake when he was trying to take the elevator to the Court Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was barking, which was broadcast live on CNN.
'I am standing right in front of you,' said one woman.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, "You have authority, but a multitude of women are powerless."
Flake reported that his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator closed, he added more to the committee's hearing.
All cable and broadband channels broadcast directly hours later when the Judicial Committee was to vote on the promotion of Kavanaugh’s candidature to the Senate in full composition.
Flake said he would only do that if he knew the FBI would look into the charges against the candidate next week, which required a democratic minority.
Flake was partially convinced by his friend, Senator Democrat Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns and then with a few senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake’s choice had an impact because it was clear that the Republicans would not have a vote to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses critics of playing politics around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "games in politics" with the future of Britain and the undermining of national interests.
On September 29, 2018 the prime minister of Great Britain, Teresa May, attended a conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview that took place next to Theresa's interview on the front page of the newspaper, her government's former foreign minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called checkers' plan for Brexit, saying that to offer Britain and the EU to collect each other's bribes “absolutely absurd”.
Who shot Wade Sims: police arrested Dayton Simpson for suspecting the death of a player at Louisiana State University.
Police arrested a suspect in a shooting that led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
The 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison for charges of second-degree murder, said in the police department of Baton Rouge.
The authorities released a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
According to WAFB’s affiliate CBS, the police removed the glasses from the crime scene and indicated that Simpson’s DNA was found on them.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had confessed to killing Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was assigned a $350,000 deposit.
The Coroner's office in East Baton Rouge released a previous report Friday, indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Department expresses its appreciation for the special section on the search for fugitives in Louisiana State Police, the state police crime lab, the South University police and the local citizens for aiding the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
The sports director at Louisiana State University, Joe Alleva, thanked local law enforcement for his “older and longing for justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
Forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at Louisiana University.
In the past season, its average score was 5.6 points and 2.6 points.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach at Louisiana State University, Will Wade, said that the team was “desolated” and “shocked” by Wade's death.
"This is what bothers you all the time," Wade said.
The volcano throws ashes at Mexico City
The ash that is being thrown out of Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern regions of the capital city of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Warning urged the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, with 183 gas and ash emissions recorded in the crater in 24 hours.
The center was tracking a number of noises and shocks.
A photo in social networks shows the thin layers of ash on the brow glass of automobiles in the outskirts of Mexico City, such as hodimilko.
Geophysicists observed an increase in volcano activity 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, after an earthquake of 7.1 in central Mexico in September 2017.
Volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police collide with Catalonian separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors in favor of independence collided with a special division of police, and thousands joined protestor demonstrations to commemorate Catalonia's first anniversary of the division vote.
A proseparatist group in masks, held by special officials, dumped them with eggs and powder paint, which created dark clouds of dust on the streets, where tourists are usually full.
The clashes took place and later on that day, the police used rods to contain aggression.
A few hours later, groups of supporters of independence, who chanted, "Let's not forget, let's not forgive!", clashed with supporters of the preservation of the country, shouting, "Let's live Spain!".
According to the local press, fourteen people were provided with assistance in causing minor injuries during protests.
One year after the referendum on October 1st, which is declared illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by Catalan separatists, tension in the region that seeks independence remains high.
The voters generally decided to vote for independence, but the phenomenon was low, as most of those opposed to separation boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting in polling stations throughout the region.
Independence groups spent Friday night in tents to prevent demonstrations in support of national police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to take another route.
68-year-old Narcisse Termes, an electrician who was involved in a separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had the hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
"Last year we survived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of joy that they could vote, but now we are at a dead end," he said.
Despite the vital but very difficult victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan parties in favour of independence were unable to save momentum this year because many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their participation in the referendum and further declaration of independence.
Hoan Pough, a 42-year-old mechanic protesting police support on the phone, said the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of last year, announced that he would be running to the European Parliament next year.
“The status of the candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and reprisals that we see from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men were arrested after the car entered the house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car drove several times into a London-Derry house.
The incident took place at Ballinogard-Krescent on Thursday at 7:30 a.m. in British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blammings noticed that the gate and the house were damaged.
It's quite possible that at some point after the car, they fired from the artillery.
Mengi's blow has led to the Livingstone victory over Rangers with a score of 1-0.
Dolly Mengi's first goal in Livingstone became a winner
A senior in the Livingstone class was shocked by Rangers and led Stephen Gerard to the second defeat of 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengi's blow was crucial: Gary Holt's team rose to one level in a second from the Hibernian.
Gerard's team won no victory at the opening night of this season, and the next Sunday, it plays with the Harts leaders, from which it stands at eight points.
On Thursday, Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna as part of the League of Europe.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues his unbeatable move to six games in the division, and chief coach Holt has not been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
"Liveington" loses its chances of unsuspecting guests.
Holt's team was supposed to be ahead long before they were killed, because their directness creates Rangers with all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but struck along the gate, then Alan Littough broke through the gate after he broke through and took Craig Halkett's punch along the gate that he had made with his head.
Masters were pleased that they allowed Rangers to play in front of them, and they knew that they could cause problems to guests from standard positions.
And so the goal was scored.
Rangers missed a free shot, and Livingstone made the opening, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson engaged Mengu, who took the ball and killed him from the center of the fine.
Before this stage, Rangers were dominated by the ball, but the defense of the field owners proved impenetrable and the gatekeeper, Liam Kelly, was largely not disturbed.
This trend continued in the second time, even though Alfredo Morelossa was able to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ass was hit by the Rangers' goalie Allan McGregor. Litgo was hit by the gate in another standard Livingstone combination.
The Navises kept flying into the Livingstone fine and continued to be neutralized, and two applications on the penalty — after Halkett’s attack on Glenn Middleton, who was replaced, and the hand game — were rejected.
Livingstone Phenomenon: Analysis
Alasair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal game and the result of Livingstone.
They all played very well, and they continued to exceed the expectations of this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and composition did not practically change after returning to the highest level, but the Holt should be given up for mobilizing the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played tremendously, organized very well, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to keep an eye on things.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under Gerard’s direction, but now they are far from reaching those standards.
They lacked the last ball — only once they broke the defense of the masters of the field — and it was like a wake-up call for Rangers, which ended up in the middle of the table.
Erdogana was received ambiguously in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, a smile and blue sky appeared.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to restore relations among NATO allies.
Some disputes have arisen between these issues, such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The Turkish population is the largest in the city outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police wouldn't let 25,000 people gather in front of the mosque, but a lot of the president's supporters showed up to see him.
Hundreds of protestors — including many Kurds — have also made themselves heard, condemning Erdogan’s politics and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests testify to the ambiguity of a guest that some German Turks called a hero and others a dictator.
Road crash in Depford: cyclist killed in a car crash
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street crossroads on a lively road in the Deptford area in the southeastern city around 10:15 a.m. British Standard Time.
The driver stopped, and paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man was killed instantly.
This accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died after a driver escaped from an adventure on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from a Saturday accident.
The London police stated that he was working on setting up a man to inform his closest relatives.
Buses have been banned and bus routes changed, and motorists recommend avoiding the area.
Long-Larthin Prison: Six prisoners injured in the riots
Six prison workers were injured as a result of the disturbances in the masculine prison of a severe regime, the prison administration informed them.
The riots in her Majesty's prison in Woostershire began about 9:30 a.m. on Sundays.
In order to stop the disturbances initiated by eight prisoners and localized in one wing, a special section of Tornado was called.
The officers were provided with medical assistance in connection with minor injuries to the face at the scene.
A prison official commented: "In order to resolve the incident that continues in the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin, specially trained prison staff were involved.
Six coworkers received medical assistance in connection with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that the responsible will be sent to the police and that the term behind the bars may be extended."
In her Majesty's prison, Long-Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, among whom the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief had been sent to stationary treatment after the prisoner's attack.
In October last year, a police unit was called into custody to stop serious disturbances that attacked prisoners with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with floods (dry areas can benefit)
Tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, but this can happen at the beginning of the next week, as the remains of Hurricane Rosa are heading southwest of the desert, creating a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings on Monday and Tuesday's floods in the area from western Arizona to south and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday, and Monday night will be rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950,
and Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to the latest projections of the National Hurricane Center, in the Mogolon-Rome area in Arizona it is projected from 5.08 to 10.16 cm and in areas up to 15.24 cm in rainfall.
Other areas in the southwest of the desert, including the central part of the Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to receive between 2.54 and 5.08 cm of rainfall, where possible up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of flooding, Rose’s rain may be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these rains are likely to be useful, as the southwest is now experiencing drought.
According to the American Drought Monitoring Centre, just over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category of drought, reports Weather.com.
First of all, Hurricane Rosa leads to shifts on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning, still in the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 19.3 km per hour.
The storm is taking place with more cool water in the Pacific Ocean and is thus weakening.
Thus, it is expected that with the power of a tropical storm during the day or at night, hurricanes will cause a shift in Mexico.
The number of rainfall in some parts of Mexico may be significant, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected that the total rainfall from Lower California to Northwest Sonore will range from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, where possible up to 25.4 cm," says weather.com.
Next, Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will continue through Arizona, and late on Tuesday evening will reach South Utah.
“The main danger that Rose or her remains are the very heavy rains in Lower California, Northwest Sonora, and southwest American desert, ” reports the National Center of Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to lead to life - threatening floods and streams of garbage in the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with knife wounds was found in Somerset.
A wounded teenager was found in Excelsior-Terras area in Midsomer-Norton at about 4:00 a.m. in British Standard Time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested at night in the Radstock area, police reported to Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking for a response from anyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Tramp says Kavanaugh “tenders of spite and anger” by the Democratic Party
“The voice behind Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” said Trump at a rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was “tender and angry” by the Democratic Party during the entire process of hanging.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, furiously and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he had committed sexual violence against her some decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness at the hearing on charges brought against her.
On Saturday, the president stated that the "American people saw the brilliance, character and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most sophisticated lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a flawless experience in public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president spoke of Kavanaugh’s release when he spoke of the importance of Republicans in the midterm elections.
"In five weeks, there will be one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't run, but I really run,” he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the mission of Democrats was "to oppose and hinder".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate is expected to take place no later than Friday, CNN reported an assistant to one of the Republican leaders.
Hundreds perished from an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the death toll increased
At least 384 people were killed, many were washed away in the ocean when giant waves hit the beach as a result of intense earthquakes and tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the country’s authorities declared on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at a beach festival in Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) in the dusks crashed off the coast, beating many to death and destroying everything in their path.
Tsunami took place after the 7.5 - point earthquake.
“When there was a tsunami last night, people were still doing their jobs on the beach and didn’t start running away immediately, and they became victims,” said a briefing at Jakarta Sotopo Purvo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency (BNPB).
"It wasn't just a tsunami, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it hit everything that was on land," Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coastline, the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h).
To save himself from the tsunami, some people climbed trees and survived, he added.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Aerophotographs published by disaster relief agencies show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been uprooted and destroyed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The postmen in the coastal town continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released as a result of a strong Friday earthquake was 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city at the end of the long, narrow cove could have contributed to the tsunami, the agency declared.
Nugroho called the crash a “wide-scale” and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found under the wreckage of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the victims and injuries could be greater than 300 km (190 miles) along the coastline north of Pal in a region called Donggala, which is closer to the quake’s epicenter.
"The lines of communication have been completely damaged, and we have not received any information" from Donggal, said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, says the Red Cross statement, and it adds that its personnel and volunteers have gone to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it can get much bigger,” the report said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for failing to report that the tsunami hit Palo, even though officials said that the waves came at the time scheduled for the warning.
On amateur frames, which people shared on social networks, a man on the top floor of the house shouts furious warnings of tsunamis approaching people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, a wall of water broke into the shore, taking the buildings and cars with it.
The Reuters were unable to verify the actuality of the frames immediately.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a serious blackout of power that cut off the connection around Pal, which made it difficult to coordinate rescue.
Military personnel began sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, told authorities, but evacuated people still need food and other items of primary importance.
The city’s airport was opened only for help, and it will be closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo was due to visit the evacuation centers in Palo on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's too bad.
World Vision associates from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where they hide in the tarpaulin tents set up in their office yard, but along the way they have seen the scenes of desolation, said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
That's too bad.
Even when relief groups began to act decisively to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, some complained that workers of foreign humanitarian aid with great experience were not allowed to go to Pal’s.
Under Indonesian rules, funding, supply and provision of personnel abroad can only start if the disaster area is declared a national disaster.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level, ” observed Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross. “
As soon as the government says, "Okay, this is a national catastrophe," we can accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been granted."
The second night fell on Paul after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, and friends and families of those who have not yet been found were still hoping that the appearance of their loved ones would be a miracle that would embellish these grim plots of natural disasters.
A little boy was taken out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers received a woman who had been lying under a stone for two days, along with her mother’s body.
Hendon Subando, coach of the Indonesian National Paraplannerism Team, trained two missing paraplanners to participate in the Asian Games earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paraplanners who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
"As an elder in the field of paraplaneism, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon relates how a few hours after the news about the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread among the Paraplanists community, he was desperate to send messages to whatsapp rivals of Paul who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray branch, not two blue branches.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves took $26,750 at the Newport on the Levee ATM
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a brink worker who used to run an ATM at the Newport on the left, reports a news report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver cleared the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man “went behind to the fellow worker Brink” and stole a bag of money to fill.
The Witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the crime scene, heading for the news, but the police did not indicate the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about these persons should contact NYPD at number 859-292-3680.
The rapper changes its name to E.
Kanye West's rapper changes his name to E.
On Saturday, announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote, "The formerly officially known as Kanier West."
41-year-old West was called E for a while, and he used this shortcut as a name for his album released in June.
The change took place the day before his appearance on the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
On the show, he replaces Ariane Grande, who canceled her participation for “emotional reasons”, the author of the show reported.
This is not only a reduction of the current professional name, but West had previously said that the word had religious meaning for it.
“I believe it is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you,” said West earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with Radio Leader Big Boy. “
So I'm you, I'm us, we're us.
Kanye, which means "one," was reduced to just E is just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he had chosen the name Love and Braser Love.
A former colleague of West, J.J.I., also experimented with defiance and large letters.
President Andrés Manuel Lopez Braudor promises not to use the army against civilians
President-in-Office of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to use an army against civilians, and soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of a bloodbath over the students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Square, López Obrador promised to "never use an army to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the military fired a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing about 300 people, and left student movements began throughout Latin America.
López Braudor promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those who were learning and by opening up more free state universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of education have led young people to criminal groups.
U.S. has to double funding in the area of artificial intelligence.
Since China is increasing its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this area, according to an investor and practice in the field of Shi Kai-Fu Li, which worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about A.I., although there is no formal strategy in the U.S. area of S.I.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it wants to become the number one innovation in the area of the sixth by 2030.
“Double budget for research of the EU would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far from the United States, and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in the sphere of the S.I.”, Lee said.
Double funding can double the probability that the next major achievement in the FI will be made in the United States, said Lee in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “Foreigns of the Six: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order”, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the Synovation Ventures Foundation, which invested in Face++, one of the most famous companies in China.
In the 1980s, in Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system called the S.I., which played the best American player in Otello, and later was the executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee noted previous competitions with technologies conducted by the U.S. government, such as Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research (DARPA), and asked when they would be next to help identify the next prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, said Lee.
"It's not China taking academic leaders, it's corporations," he noted.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been hiring light from universities in recent years to work on the Shi.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to increase efforts in the field of S.I.
"I believe that Green Card should be automatically offered to the candidates of science in the field of SII," he said.
China’s National Council published its New Generation artificial intelligence plan in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to persons working in academic institutions, just as the National Science Fund and other U.S. government organizations give money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work in China below, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Defense had created a Joint Centre of artificial intelligence to engage industrial and academic partners, and the White House had announced the creation of an artificial intelligence special committee.
Also this month at DARPA, two billion dollars was pledged to AI Next.
With regard to the National Science Fund, he is investing more than $100 million a year in research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to create a Commission on National Intelligence Security, has taken no action for a few months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change in country name
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, allowing to resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia from membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim on its territory, and vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments made a deal on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the treaty claim that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raises doubts as to whether there will be a minimum voter of 50% that would allow the referendum to be valid.
The questions in the referendum paper are: "Do you support membership in NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should pay for admission to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote does not entail legal obligations, enough members of Parliament have said that they support it to make it decisive.
It takes two thirds of Parliament's votes to change the names.
The State Election Commission stated that there were no reports of violations by 1:00.
However, only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters threw their ballots into the urns.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old voter José Tanevski in Skopje.
On September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, the prime minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorika, and his son, Dusko, gave their vote in a referendum on changing the country's name, which will pave the way for NATO and the European Union to join.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and placed the chair in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proud head, not through a service door," said Kavardarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can talk to others, like China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership will bring a lot of needed investments to Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority vote in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after the vote.
He noted that the result “yes” would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, 30 to 43% of voters will participate in the referendum, and this is below the required phenomenon.
According to another Macedonian TV channel, Telma, 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be declared valid, the event must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first serious blow to the politics of the pro-Western government since its beginning in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes the entire Brighton defense and scores the goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling took the Brighton defense and won the Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Atihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Gol Aguero for the 65th minute of the match looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker was given a pass at the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton supporters and ended up in an open field.
Then Agüero realized that he was surrounded by four green ones.
He went around one defender, then ran a few more on the edge of Brighton's fine.
Then he made the pass to the left, when he saw Sterling.
The English forward made the first touch of a fine to give back the Aguero ball, which his right butt launched it to the right side of the gate, defeating the Brighton holocaust to Matt Ryan.
“Aguero has some problems with his legs,” said City Manager Pep Guardiola.
We agreed that he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are fortunate that he scored a goal at this moment."
But the original advantage of the sky blue in this premier league match was provided by Sterling.
This goal took place in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton territory.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along the left flank of Leroy Sanne.
Leroy made a few touches and then continued to pass Sterling in the direction of the far rack.
Forward of the celestial blue threw the ball into the gate just before he slipped off the line.
Siti will meet Hoffenheim in the championship league group at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rain Neckar Arena Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shercer wants to take points off the Rokis
Since Washington Nashonals has left the playoffs, there were no substantial reasons to wait for the next start.
But the contestant Schertzer is hoping to come out on Sunday at the Battle of Colorado Rokis, provided that Rokiss still has a hard time getting out of the playoffs. Now Rokis is playing one game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West.
Rokis has the Wild Card at least to win the 5-2 bill over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want the title of the first division behind them.
"Despite that we're playing for nothing, at least we'll be able to leave the ball, knowing how the viewers are here in Denver, and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I've seen all this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this contest?
The Nationals will announce who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but it is reported that they are leaning towards being Chercer.
Shercer, for which it will be the 34th start, held a pitching session on Thursday and can play Sunday, his usual weekend.
The Washington Right has a result of 18-7 of 2.53 ERA and 300 strike cars in 220 2/3 inning this season.
Trump’s rally in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation surrounding his candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the appearance of Republican supporters in the midterm elections.
"All that we have done will be placed on the map in November.
Five weeks from now, there will be one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones — I don’t run, but I really run, so wherever I can, I fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power using whatever means you can see the filth, the filth.
They don't care who suffers from them, who needs to get over them, to get control, they want power and control, we're not going to give them."
A democracy mission, he said, “to oppose and hinder”.
"And you see it during the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "evil and mean, disgusting and lying".
He mentioned the Senate's Judicial Committee, calling Senator Diane Fainstein by name, which caused the audience to shout out dissatisfaction.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you give the document?
Uh-uh.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- it was really bad body language -- the worst language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a large church.
It is intolerant of those who express themselves.
When momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last of those Labour Members of Parliament to be told that they do not like it, and that's because we express our opinion.
My Parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated almost the same as she did because she firmly opposed anti - Semitism.
I was convicted of not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
As to the importance of responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, these questions are ironically similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday says, "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local Labour Member of Parliament were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, today many meetings have a very different tone, and the promise of a “more kind, more soft” policy has long been forgotten if it was ever started.
It becomes increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not allow differing views, and each opinion is assessed from the point of view of whether it is acceptable for the party’s leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues I thought I had had similar political views began to expect that I would turn 180 degrees and take positions that I would never agree with, whether national security or the only market in the EU.
Always, when I speak out publicly — and it doesn't matter what I say — this is followed by a tyranny of attacks on social networks calling for feedback, condemning the politics of the center, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments to me are usually political.
I am thrilled at the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face daily the flow of sexist or racist attacks, but they never refuse.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbin stated last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a large church, and with every movement of mistrust or change in the party's selection rules, the party is narrowed down.
During the past two years, I have received many suggestions, and I have been urged not to take a stand, not to speak loudly, so that “it’s all right with me”.
But that's not why I came to politics.
I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because the lack of attention on the part of the government of Tetcher, my high school class literally broke down, since then I want to improve the quality of government services for those who need them most, whether the local councillor or the minister of government.
I have never hidden my politics, including in the last elections.
Nobody in Nottingham East has bothered me with my political views and differences with today's leadership.
For those of you who have contributed to Friday's events, I want to say one thing: when you go to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I have one more message, but not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, as members of the Labour Party, and neither: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to me and no political advantage will prevent me from acting according to what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Air Rises Up
The last two attempts may have distorted the final result, but no doubt Air deserved a triumph in today's great entertainment match of the Scottish Premiership.
Now they're heading the table, it's the only unbeatable team of ten.
Finally, the excellent defense and improved ability to take advantage of opportunities gives masters and coach Peter Merci the full right to be content.
“We have been tested so far by our games, and we are still undefeated, so I have to be satisfied,” he said.
Robin Kristi of Melrose commented, "I give Air the right, they used their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute test, carried out by Frazier Klimo, brought Eyre forward, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, published by Verriors, allowed Melrose to show the figures, and Jason Baggott used an unrealized attempt.
Klimo strengthened Air leadership by using the penalty and immediately prior to the break made and implemented the solo test, which gave an account of 17-5 in favour of Air.
But Melrose has started the second time well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggotto, has reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a prolonged delay due to the serious trauma of Ruarod Knott, who had been removed from the field on a stretcher, and from the Air launch, they moved forward by means of an attempt by Stafford McDowell, which was carried out by Klimo.
Captain Air Blair McPherson then had a yellow card, and Melrose again forced another player to pay for Bruce Colvin's unrealized effort under intense pressure.
The masters returned, but when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for intercepting Klimo without the ball from the ticket line, McFherson made a touchdown behind the Air mole.
Climate realized the attempt he had made almost every time after the reboot, after which Kyle Roe received a blow from David Armstrong in the box and sent Gregor Henry's flange to the fifth attempt by the team of the masters.
Looks like the "All Still Game" star is set for a new career in the restaurant field
Ford Kiran appears to be the star of the "All More Game" series set up for a new career in hospitality, and it can be concluded after he became known to be the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC TV series, a script he writes and shoots with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
Duet announced that the future ninth series would be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan plans life after Craigling.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's “a thriving restaurant business. ”
"Our Seas": Interior Bolivia expects the court to open its way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol an equipped fleet headquarters in La Pasi.
Civil buildings hang an ocean-blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with a motto: “Ours must be right.
We have to get him back."
In Bolivia, which has no way out to sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coastline that has left Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century due to natural resources, and there is also a desire to swim again in the Pacific.
These hopes are now perhaps the strongest in recent decades, because Bolivia is awaiting an international court ruling on October 1st after five years of trial.
"There is a momentum in Bolivia, there is a spirit of unity and tranquillity and, of course, it expects a positive outcome," commented Roberto Calsadiya, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the announcement of the ICJ decision on large screens throughout the country, and they expect the Hague tribunal to decide in favour of Bolivia that after decades of deliberation Chile will negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to Bolivia.
Here is Morales, the charismatic root president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his transition the following year, also puts high hopes in a decision that will be announced Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in behalf of Bolivia, and if that happens, little will change.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands does not have the authority to judge Chile’s territory and notes that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The decision of the ICJ, taken only six months after final arguments were made, indicates that the case was “not complicated”, told Pass Zarat, Chilean international law expert.
In Bolivia’s case, the last four years have been able to contribute to a relapse.
"The question of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration," Zarat said.
Morales ’ military rhetoric blew up leftovers of Chilean kindness, she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Weltz, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed that court approval was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and to end 139 years of differences with mutual benefit," he said.
Calsadya also denied that Morales, another of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added. "
This decree is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it doesn't trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his country will never give up its nuclear weapons before Washington can trust them.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep the promises made during the summit in Singapore by the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments came when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which went to a dead end more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Chen-in.
Ri says that belief that the continuation of sanctions and the U.S. resistance to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will eventually put North Korea on its knees is “an unreal dream”.
Washington fears to adopt a declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps to disarm.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the rejection of its arsenal, which the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
In Paris’ fashion shows, the latest trend of massive major outfits has been presented, which is already heading to the main streets of your city.
If you want to increase your hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you have found what you need.
Valentino and Tom Brown designers have demonstrated a number of eccentric master outfits in the style of an overrise from the spring-summer 2019 collection on the podiums of a brilliant Paris fashion week.
Very impractical hats captured Instagram this summer, and the named designers have already sent their stunning creations beyond the podium.
Valentino stood out with an extravagant beige hat with a wide adorned feather fields that covered model heads.
Among other overrising axesuaries are decorated with precious coffeestones, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple hat, but they are not to keep his head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated the range of original masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks had sewn lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than high - fashioned.
One creature resembled underwater swimming equipment with tubes and spectacles, and another looked like an ice-truck that had melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
Stylists say that huge hats can come onto the main streets of your city.
Overriding hats came into fashion thanks to Le Bomby, a broken hat with a six-inch field width that everyone saw: from Rianna to Emily Ratazhkovsky.
A cult brand behind a very impractical hat that could be seen all over the social media gave peace another creation: a broken beach bag almost as big as a model in the bathroom that carried it.
A bag of yellow-red liquor with a bascule and a white leather handle was the central element of the La Riviera collection spring-summer 2019 brand Jacquesmus in Paris fashion week.
Stylist Luke Armage told FEMAIL: “The next summer I look forward to seeing large hats and beach bags on the main streets of the city, because the influence of the designer is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore demand for overriding accessories.”
John Edward: Language required for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland support high standards of education, and in 2018 there are once again fine results from tests complemented by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music, and other fields.
These schools, which teach more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SWS). They seek to provide the best level of services for students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for the further and higher education they have chosen as their careers, and to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person’s language that he understands, he understands it with his mind.
If you talk to her in her native language, she takes it with her heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't use just English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year’s exams show that in independent schools languages are best rated subjects.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received a higher level of A.
The data collected at 74 schools of SNSH showed that 72% of students received a higher A from Chinese and 72% from German students, 69% from French students, and 63% from Spanish students also received A.
This indicates that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Language as a subject of choice is now presented in the same way as subjects of NTIM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), in independent school programs and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the reasons employers cannot close vacancies related to language skills.
As a result, language skills become increasingly needed in preparing young people for their future career.
As more and more promising positions require language knowledge, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what career you choose, if someone learns a second language, they'll have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives people who speak several languages the advantage of competitors.
According to a survey by YouGov conducted by more than 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75% could not speak foreign language well enough to support conversation, and French is the only language spoken by ambiguous percentage (15%).
That's why investment in language education is now important for modern children.
Learning a few languages, especially as developing countries, will provide children with a better chance of finding a fuller job.
In Scotland, each school will learn its own language.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for Britain from the perspective of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, you can always select several languages to study them with qualified speakers.
Scotland’s independent schools try to create a school environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed regardless of what their future holds.
Now, we can't deny that in the international language business, languages continue to have vital meaning for the future country, so this has to be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be considered “a habit of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to make this choice, the diversity and perfection of Scottish youths.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts from Lakers in San Diego
Fantas who want to see LeBron James' first start as Los Angeles Lakers, are almost welcome.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing Sunday in the first pre-season match against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's going to play, it's not decided yet.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell reported that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of the Lakers pre-season schedule.
"At this stage, I do not need pre-seasonal games to prepare my career," he replied.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of pre-election rallies from Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned for the next week of Trump's rally, including rallying in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the nomination he has proposed to the Supreme Court has been postponed, and Trump is eager to form support for future mid-term elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
At what time will the evening celebration of Trump be held in West Virginia, and how can you view it on the Internet?
The Trump rally in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19 hours east time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online below in direct air on YouTube.
Trump is likely to mention the strain of hearings that took place this week on behalf of a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh, who is accused of sexual harassment, and the postponement of the Senate's vote for a week while the FBI's investigation is ongoing.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans get a taste for the election in November.
President Trump's representatives said that these five rally events next week are aimed at "activating volunteers and supporters, because the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand most of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
“The control of Congress is so critical for its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible, because the tense season of the campaign is approaching,” said Reuters, a representative of Trump’s campaign who did not want to name his name.
A rally planned at Vesbanko Arena in Wiling today’s rally may be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as by a media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's visit will be the second in the last month of Trump's visit to West Virginia, where he won more than 40% of the votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate from Republicans to the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morris, whose rating is behind the polls.
“ It’s not good for Morris who comes to raise his poll ratings, ” commented Reuters Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team set up to fight and full of hope on the eve of Sunday singles
After three sessions, which ended with a one - sided victory, the afternoon Saturday forsoms can become exactly what this Ryder cup lacked.
An emergency momentum pendulum is a completely fabricated sports concept in which players really believe, especially in similar competitions.
So when are they going to say that the pulse is working?
"They were six points ahead, and now four points, so I think we take it a little bit as a impulse," said Jordan Spit when he left.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, four points ahead and twelve points further in the game.
The Americans, as Spit says, feel a little wind in their sails, and they also have a lot to encourage, not least, the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and everyone earned three points out of four.
Spit with his killer punches from that madman to the dirt shows an example.
These larynx cheers of celebration became louder when, during the course of his round, he made a decisive patt and leveled the score at the fourth match after he and Thomas were two points behind.
His patt, which allowed them to win a 15-hole match, met with a similar scream, one that tells you that the American team doesn't give up.
"You really just have to work hard and worry about your own game," said Spit.
That's all any of these players left now.
18 holes to become famous.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days — Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of Cup Ryder.
An unusual but charming couple from Europe have four out of four and cannot make mistakes.
"Mollywood" was the only couple who didn't make the gods on Saturday afternoons, and they also managed to avoid the godgy on Saturdays and after Fridays and nine last holes on Friday mornings.
This race and how their energy seems to flow to this turbulent crowd back and forth, forces them to believe that they will win Sunday and that there will be no more popular players besides Fleetwood or Molinari to fortify the potential victory of Europeans when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Both are desirable on different holes at the same time.
However, the triumph of Europeans is still early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson got away with Sergio García, the hero of the morning bouts when he was with Alex Noreen.
One godgie and two dublets in the first nine holes led the Spaniard and the Swede to a hole they could never get out of.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It is very interesting to observe foreballs and foresoms closely because of the interaction they offer, the advice they do not give, and it is interesting to see how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe currently plays better as a team and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this session of force has also shown that the United States team intends to fight, in which some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe leads with a score of 10-6 on the last day of Cup Ryder
On the final day, the Cub of Ryder Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday's formulas and forosomals it precedes the United States with a score of 10-6.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won two victories over the backward Tiger Woods, and now at Le Golf National they have four points.
The European team, Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to return the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in morning calls with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. resisted more force and won two matches, but failed to cut the gap.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, while he and Mollinari (with Mollywood) are only the second pair to score four points in the first four matches in the history of Kubk Ryder.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the forballs, they teamed up to defeat the smoky Woods and New American Brayson Deschambo with an even more effective 5ta4.
Woods, who pulled two matches on Saturday, demonstrated accidental outbreaks of genius, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in forballs and forsoms and seven matches in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning bouts, returned to Henry Stanson’s partner in the forsomnia to be defeated with a score of 2ta1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coepka, who are the first and third in the world ranking.
Europe has not been able to do everything in its own way on this pleasant, fresh day south-west of Paris.
Three times Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the standard for Americans with their two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive 2ta1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Poulter in the forballs and later beat Poulter and Rory McLroy with a score of 4ta3 in the forsomnia, losing two first holes.
Only twice in the history of Kubk Ryder's team returned with a deficit of four points in singles, although Furika's team needed nothing to save the trophy.
However, after a second place for two days, Sunday’s counterattack looks as if it is impossible for them.
North Korea says that “no way” will be disarmed in unilateral order without trust
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister told the UN that the continuation of sanctions would increase mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country would in no way be able to renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Young Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that last year North Korea had used “substantial measures of goodwill”, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of a nuclear test site and the obligation not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will by no means be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally.”
Although Ree reiterated North Korea's familiar complaints about the resistance of Washington's “temporary” approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea will be rewarded for its gradual steps, his claim proved important because it did not reject the unilateral denuclearization done by Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to Kim Chen Ian and Donald Trump's joint statement at the first summit in history between the real president of the United States and North Korea's leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim called for work on the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", and Trump promised security assurances for North Korea.
North Korea is looking forward to the formal end of the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to weaken the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "denuclearisation first" and raises pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal violently, and even denies "declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream for those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed in the United States at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Zhe In in the last five months and added: “If South Korea were to be a party to this issue of denuclearisation, and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have gone to such a dead end.”
Nevertheless, Ri’s tone of speech was very different from that of last year, when he told the General Assembly that North Korean missile targeting the mainland of the United States was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim “a man-rocket” who wanted to commit suicide.
This year, at UN Trump, which threatened to destroy North Korea in its entirety last year, praised Kim for his courage in using disarmament measures, but said that much more would need to be done and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump noted that he did not set a time frame for this: "It will take two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council is to reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary-General Mike Pompeo stated to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The sanctions of the Security Council must continue energetically and steadily until we see complete, final, confirmed denuclearisation.”
The Security Council has consistently increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to block financing for the nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles of Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ree in the United Nations General Assembly pools and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but after a few hours, North Korea sentenced him to “gangster requirements”.
During this month's meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States takes “the appropriate measures”.
He explained that, according to Kim, he needed “suite measures” are security assurances that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has provided all of his students with more sleep, an attempt to combat the growing culture of barbed learning all night after caffeine.
The teacher found that students at university number one in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very foundations of how to care for themselves.
Charles Chaseler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigama’s Women’s Hospital, developed a course he thought was the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start a course after giving a lecture on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally, a girl came up to him and said, "Why do they tell me this now, on the final course?"
“She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” said the lecturer at The Telegraph.
In this year’s first course, students explain how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sporting results, as well as to improve the overall well - being.
Paul Barrair, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of medical services at the university, said that the university had decided to introduce a course after it had been discovered that students had been seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there's a picture of a room in a dorm, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deficits on sports indicators, and the importance of sleep-related routine.
In another chapter, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change students' behavior instantly.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the consequences of smoking cigarettes for health," added Professor Chaseler.
The culture of pride for "dream all night" still exists, he added, and noted that modern technologies and increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is increasing.
A sufficient sleep of good quality should be a “secret weapon” of a student to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, even with a set of extra weights, because deprivation of sleep translates the brain into a hunger regime that causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop a course after enrolled in one of his other courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to do a similar program of learning to come into a competitive institution.
Professor Chaseler recommends that students be reminded that they need to go to bed and wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light, which is emitted by electronic screens and LEDs and can disrupt the circadian rhythm, causing problems with sleep.
"Liveington" 1-0 "Ringers": Goal Mengi upsets Gerard's boys
The Rangers survived another outcast: Dolly Mengi's hit brought a distinguished Steven Gerard defeat with a score of 1-0 from Livingstone.
The Aybroksa team wanted to win its first exit match after the February triumph over St. John'ston, accounted for 4-1, but the Gary Holt team defeated Gerard in his second 18th game manager. Gerard's team remained eight points behind the Scottish Premiership of Harts.
Menga was killed seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers warehouse, which lacked inspiration, did not seem to balance the score.
The Rangers are now in position six, and the Livingstone are up third, and only the Hibernian are ahead of the games.
In addition, Rangers may have another problem, as Linsman Kalum Spence had to process the head wound after being thrown into the guest sector by some object.
Gerard made eight changes to a team that had once passed Air in the Scottish League’s semifinal.
And Holt released the same "Levi 11" warehouse that took one point to Harts last week, and was delighted to see how his trained boys were suppressed by rivals at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingstone worked harder with the ball.
They were to kill only two minutes later when Menga's first pass to the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit the gates of Allan McGregor, but the half-protector wasted this great opportunity by sending a ball through the gate.
Deep free shot by Keagan Jacobs was taken by Squire Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense, Alan Littough, hit the back of the stall.
Rangers really got control, but in the last third there was more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he should be entitled to the penalty at a quarter of an hour after the encounter with Stephen Loules, but the report by Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian appeal.
Rangers only managed to hit two doors in the first time, but Liam Kelly's former gatekeeper, Liam Kelly, hit Lassana Kulibali's head and the peaceful impact of Ovej Ejaria was hardly disturbed.
Even though the former Livingstone goal of 34 minutes may have been in conflict with the course of the game, no one can deny that they have earned it only by their hard work.
The Rangers failed to handle Jacobs' equipment again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Mengu to just finish.
During the break, Gerard replaced the Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when he broke through to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran down from his line to block it.
However, Livingstone continued to force the guests to play exactly the kind of game they liked when Littow and Halkett made one long pass after another.
Holt's team could have improved in the final stages, but MacGregor was a good match for Jacobs before Litgo got hit from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, replacing Rangers, made another late application for a fine when he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson took another look.
Almanac: Geiger Inventor
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and time goes on... in Germany a future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born.
Heiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, he has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of culture, such as in the 1950 film "Calling the Coronado" with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play questionable cowboy scientists.
Man: "What's this all about?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger counter that is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear how radiation in minerals affects atoms."
Evans: "Well, it's really cracking now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945 just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells that are part of the treatment
The method is to remove the immune cells in the patient and change them in the laboratory.
Then these cells are able to see proteins, which are common to many cancers, and then these cells reintroduce the patient again.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells has more than 18 months of ovarian cancer.
The method involves removing the immune cells in the patient, changing them in the laboratory in such a way that these cells can “see” common to many types of protein cancer (HER2), and re-introducing these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofski of the U.S. National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland, noted: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine.”
"HER2" stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which involves removing immune cells from patients and learning them to target cancer cells, worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
After the SNL show appeared in the studio at the MAGA, Kanye West, with a sharp speech in support of President Trump,
what caused the negative reaction of the viewers
The SNL (Friday Evening on Direct air) audiences whistled at Kanye after his concert, during which he praised President Donald Trump, U.S. President, and declared that he would be running for the presidency in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Town in a baseball game called "Let's Return America's former Glory," he exploded with a tirade in which he criticized Democrats, and again declared his support to Trump.
"Frequently during a conversation, the whites ask me, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist."
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America long ago," he said.
The show SNL began with a sketch of Matt Damon, where a Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Legal Committee in a case called Christine Blasey Ford about sexual violence.
Although Vest’s speech was not broadcast on direct air, the video with his tirade was released on the social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether the Year was going to mock West by placing this fast.
Wes also complained to the audience that he was in an unpleasant situation because of his headgear.
As reported by Washington Examiner, West said, "When I was behind the scenes, I was treated rudely.
They said to me, "Don't go to the audience in this baseball game."
They made fun of me!
And then they tell me I'm in a place where the oppressed are silent."
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the place where the oppressed are silent? I'll wear my superman baseball because nobody can tell me what to do so.
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to Variety's weekly, his comments at least twice triggered a negative reaction from the audience in the hall, and the SNL actors seemed distracted, and one of the audiences said, "There was a dead silence in the studio."
The news at the last minute was invited to replace Ariane Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper McMiller, died a few days before the air.
The West was surprised to hear that I love it (I love it) in a Perrier water bottle suit.
The news was supported by TPUSA Kendez Turner, who wrote in Twitter: "One of the bravest: I THANK YOU FOR STANDING AGAINST NATO".
Instead, Karen Hunter, the leading talk show, wrote in Twitter that West "is who he is, and that's just wonderful."
"But I'm NOT going to reward him (buying his music or clothing or supporting his 'art'), who, in my opinion, professes and throws out an ideology that harms my community.
He's a free man.
So do we," she added.
Before performing the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name: he's now "the one they knew before as Kanier West."
West is not the first performer to change his name, and he follows the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Paffy and Pi Diddy.
Snoop Dog's rapper was previously called Snoop Lyon, and it's known that the musical legend of the last decade Prins changed his name to a symbol and then became "An artist formerly known as Prince."
Charged with attempted murder after a knife attack at a restaurant in Belfast

The D.A.'s office will look into the charges.
Keith Guerrington's Star of Thrones Condemns The Idealization of Brutality
Keith Goerington became famous because of the role of a warrior with John Snow's sword in the brutal medieval fantasy series "The Game of Thrones" of HBO production.
However, a 31-year-old performer condemns the stereotyping of macho characters, claiming that because of such characters on screens, young boys often seem to have to get cool enough to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said that he thought "something went wrong," and asked how to solve the problem of idealizing brutality in the era of the popularity of the hashtag #MeTo, #hell, etc.).
Keith, who recently married his colleague at the Game of Thrones, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, noted that he was "very determined" to deal with this problem.
When we're on the slippery path of idealizing brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men to look at their growth because of the prism of the problem we see now?"
Kitt believes that television is partly responsible for promoting brutality through images of extremely courageous heroes.
He went on to say, "What is natural and what do they plant on us?
Why teach TV and the street that young boys feel pressure to be such men?
I think today is a really important question, "How can we change that?"
After all, it's obvious that young boys have strayed from the right path."
In an interview, he also noted that he would not be recorded in any pretzels and sieves of the "Games of Thrones" after the final show of the show next summer, because "he had already ended battles and horses."
Since November, Keith is going to play the play "The Real West" by Sam Shepherd, the story of the movie producer and his brother the robber.
As an actor recently confessed, he considers meeting with his wife Rose the best he's ever gotten from participating in the Game of Thrones series.
"In the course of the film I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and determined my future life," said Keith.
In the fantasy show that won the Emmy Award, Rose played Igritte, the hero's love for Guerrington John Snow.
The ceremony was held on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China claims a sharp increase of 14% in the number of new cases
In China, a sharp increase of 14% was reported in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
According to health authorities, there are generally more than 820,000 patients in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 were 40,000 new cases reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted sexually, indicating a change in the previous trend.
For a long time in some regions of China, HIV was rapidly distributed through infected blood during transfusions.
However, according to official health authorities at a conference held in Yunnan Province, the number of people infected by HIV has dropped to almost zero.
In comparison with the previous year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Timely transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LGBT community often suffers from discrimination.
According to studies, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with other men are later married to women because of the domination of conservative values in the country.
The transmission of the disease in most cases occurs as a result of improper use of remedies during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HlV medicines, thus partially solving the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the Republican senators' data is being uploaded to the network by a full-time employee, and she's being critical of the "dangerous lie" and "conspiracy theories."
On Saturday, a U.S. House member Maxine Waters denounced the statements that one of her employees had posted personal data from three U.S. senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The L.A. Democrat claims that these statements spread ultra-right to political viewers and websites.
"Breed, lie, and then more disgusting lies," Waters said in Twitter.
Reportedly, published information contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getcha of Utah.
The data came online on Thursday, and they were posted by an unknown person from the Capitol during hearings on the Senate commission for allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a U.S. Supreme Court judge.
Data leaks took place some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The Hill reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, there was information that the source IP address was linked to Waters' office and was able to track down the data of its current employee.
"These baseless statements are absolute lies, they do not correspond to reality," continued Waters.
"The employee of my office, whose personal data and security are put at risk as a result of these fabricated and lying claims, has nothing to do with the source of this information.
These baseless statements are absolute lies, they don't fit reality."
Waters was quickly criticized online, among others was former White House Press Secretary Ari Flysher.
"This objection is full of anger," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests that with this nature she cannot be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of what he did not do, there is no need to be angry.
The accused should not act presumptuously.
He should not ask about the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and unmovable."
It seems that Fleischer was paralleling Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats at Judge Kavanaugh's address, who was accused of looking too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republic Party, who is running to take up Waters for the results of the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion in Twitter.
"This is so news, if all is true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters noted that her office had already reported "the relevant public authorities and the law enforcement authorities about these false claims."
"We will do our best to find the guilty," she continued, "and they answered before the law for their actions which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
A review of "Agent Johnny English: New Mission" is a passing parody of spy fighters with Rowen Atkinson.
Now it's a good tradition to look into every new British film for ideas inspired by Brexit, and there they are in a new part of the series of comedy parodys about Johnny English, and the first film called "Johnny English" was released in 2003, and later the series was reinstated in 2011, after "Johnny English: Restarting."
Will it become a mockery-iron self-satisfying, which we are at short notice, the new export potential of the nation?
Anyway, Johnny English with his moving face and his bulging eyes secondly got the chance to make a mess, and his name suggests more than anything else that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English countries.
Johnny is known to be a funly secret agent, where despite his strange efforts to be gallant and charming, there's a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean, and a lot of things, from the guy who played a one-note tune from the movie "Fire Wheels" at the Olympic Games opening ceremony in London in 2012.
The figure is also depicted as a traveler and a mystery of an international scale that has always left behind the turmoil that Atkinson once played in a long - forgotten TV commercial by Barclaycard.
In the last Johnny English movie, there are a few beautiful moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny English in his knights ’ armor approached the helicopter, and the blades of the screws dipped over his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for bufonade is well exposed, but humor is pervasive, and at some point it's too much, especially when compared with "serious" movies, like Agent 007 and Mission Impossible, one of the ingredients of which is also comedy.
It seems to me that jokes are designed for children rather than for adults, and I don't find the stupid attacks that are happening with Johnny Ingleshee as resourceful and thoughtful as Atkinson's jokes in the silent films about Bin.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
A British supersecret spy network penetrates the hacker and reveals the names of all field agents, which has become a complete surprise for an active agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an epic role in the film).
This proved to be the last drop for the prime minister, a proud person who has already suffered devastating criticism and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried best to convey the image that Teresa May had on, but the script failed to reveal it fully).
Intelligence counselors informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she needed to be involved with a retired person.
The choice falls to the awkward Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at some super-moded facility and informally teaches children to work undercover (there were a number of successful jokes in this part of the English spy "school of the year".
England is quickly transported to Whitehall for an urgent briefing, where he meets his long - suffering friend Buff, who is played by Ben Miller for the next time.
Baff is now married to a captain of the submarine (the role of an exhaled annoying person is not exactly the same as Vicky Pepperdin’s talent).
So, when everyone in Her Majesty's Secret Service went skerebrebert, Batman and Robin are back in line and suddenly meet the fatal woman Ophelia Pistolette, played by Olga Curilenko.
And at this time, the prime minister gets under the charm of a charismatic billionaire who earns his fortune in the field of technology and technology and says he can remove the problem with the British network, the evil Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
Ingleish and Buff go on a journey and again resort to their ridiculous pranks: dressed by waiters, they fire in a fancy French restaurant; they sow chaos, illegally travelling abroad on Volta’s magnificent yacht; and English makes real mess when trying to use the helmet of virtual reality to explore the planning of Volta’s house.
All the stops lead us to the final episode, but with kindness and rage, it resembles a movie for children.
A passing film.
As with other film clips about Johnny English, I asked myself the same question: Is it not true that the British film industry cannot offer Rowen Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
The Leibourists object to a plan that will allow the British to work four days a week, but they will receive a salary in five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbin has to discuss a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week, but they will receive a salary in five days.
It's reported that the Party wants to oblige the leaders of companies to transfer the funds saved as a result of a revolution of artificial intelligence, to workers, giving them an extra weekend.
Thus, the workers will have a three - day weekend — bringing home the same wage.
According to sources, this idea will fit the party’s economic agenda and direct the country’s resources to support the working class.
The shift to a four-day working week was approved at the British Congress of Tred Unions, and it is expected that workers will be able to benefit from changing the global economic situation.
The source of the Labour Party reported on The Sunday Times: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
It doesn't change in one night, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Leiborists did not first endorse this idea, because the Green Party promised to start a four-day work week during the pre-election campaign in 2017.
However, not all members of the Labour Party at this time accept this desire.
The speaker of the Labour Party stated, "The party's political program does not provide for a four-day working week, so we're not looking at this idea right now."
"Tiny" Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party's pre-election meeting last week.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was set to take back power from the "noble directors" of utilities and exploiters.
The tenant chancellor's plan also means that shareholders of water companies may not get their share of the capital if the Labour government introduces "countdown" on the basis of imaginary violations.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers in company management and create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of the ordinary private sector shares to workers who are expected to receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy are talking on show 60 Minutes (60 minutes), or can the investigation of the Kavanaugh case led by the FBI change their minds
In connection with investigating the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who is leading the FBI, the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court is postponed at least a week, and the question arises whether the Republican senators will continue to support Kavano after the results of the investigation have been published.
On Sunday's show 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that might change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
'Yes, of course,' said Kennedy.--
During the hearings, I explained that I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after everything happened and the charge came out, and asked him, "Did you really do it?"
He was determined, uncompromising, uncompromising."
It seems that Graham’s opinion will no longer change.
"I think the indictment of Kavanaugh is a provocation," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know what Brett strongly objected to," added Graham, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
And anyone she calls can't prove it under oath.
This happened 36 years ago.
I don't understand what can change."
What is Global Citizens Festival, and how can it affect poverty reduction?
On this Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival – an annual event in the music world with a staggering number of star performers and an equally devastating mission – to conquer poverty worldwide.
During the 7th Global Citizens Festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to the Grand Rim of the Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, but also to attract attention to the real goal of the festival - organizers want to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which was launched in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international social organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively struggling with it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay the VIP tickets), visitors have to do a number of tasks or "acts", such as taking lessons in a volunteer project, writing an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or anything else to help attract attention to the organization's goal of eradicating poverty.
So are there any results, since Global Citizens has been 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is it really an idea to reward for doing a free concert a genius way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicivism" where people feel they're actually changing something by signing an electronic petition or by doing a publication on Twitter?
According to Global Citizens, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million "acts" of their adherents aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization states that these actions have prompted world leaders to declare the planned financial advances and programs of more than $37 billion that will help to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited its 390 financial liabilities and public statements as an example, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
An estimated 649 million people worldwide have already been directly affected by the funds provided by the group.
One of the main financial liabilities is the Fund of The Power of Nutrition, which is territorially related to Britain, and as part of the project, investors and realisers committed themselves to helping children grow up and pledged $35 million to help Rwanda overcome malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens on Twitter.
"In support of the government of Great Britain, Mecents, Governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a small fact of history," said the representative of The Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman, speaking to the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 "actions", which called for improving the nutrition of mothers and children, the UK government announced the allocation of funds for the project The Power of Nutrition, aimed at improving the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can overcome extreme poverty?"
Global Citizens wrote this: "This is a long and difficult way, so sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the civil rights and apartheid actors, we will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are only part of the star performers who will be performing at the New York festival this year, and he will be greeted by Deborah-Ley Fernness and Guy Jackman.
Interior Minister said the US could use naval forces to block Russian energy exports
According to U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, quoted in Washington Examiner, Washington, Washington, D.C., may seek assistance from naval forces to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including Middle East markets.
Zinke stated that Russia's involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a reason to explore new energy sources.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to become a middleman in energy trade, as they already do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the employer, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"Thanks to the US Navy, it can ensure free passage through the sea and, if necessary, block them so that the Russian energy sources do not enter the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, which was conducted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that positions itself as the "voice of each consumer" in the United States.
He then compared his approach to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they were virtually similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy efficiently and replace it with alternatives," he said, calling Russia "single development", because its economy depends on mineral energy.
At the time these statements were made, Trump’s administration set the goal of increasing the export of compressed natural gas to Europe by pushing the Russian energy market out of Russia’s energy market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To this end, the Trump administration officials and President Donald Trump themselves are trying to convince the German government to abandon the "inconvenient" project of building the "North Stream 2", which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that "North Stream 2" is worth $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin convinces Washington to take a strong stand against the project for only economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry, who was in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position triggered a negative reaction by Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German leading organisation of the Federal Union of the German Industry (BDI) urged the United States not to intervene in EU energy policy and bilateral arrangements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when a third country interferes with our supply of energy," said Dieter Kemp, head of the Federal Union of German Industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is going to "seriously think" about running for president in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts stated on Saturday that she would "seriously think" about running for president after the mid-term elections.
During a public meeting in Galiok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of putting forward her candidacy.
According to The Hill Warren, she said, "It's time for women to go to D.C. and set up the government, and for that, there must be a woman in charge."
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider putting my candidacy on the presidency."
During her meeting with the public, Warren expressed her assessment of the presidency of Donald Trump, stating that he "led his country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank, criticizing Trump and his proposed appointment as Supreme Court Judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
In Friday's tweet Warren wrote, "...no doubt, the FBI has to investigate before the vote."
However, according to Friday's polls, most of Warren's voters don't think she should be running in 2020.
According to a survey conducted jointly by the Saffolka University Political Research Centre and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of potential voters in Massachusetts objected to the senator's nomination.
Thirty - two percent supported the move.
The results of the survey showed that former Governor Deval Patrik was more supportive of the situation, and that he could be promoted to the presidency by 38%, against 48%.
During discussions on the nominations of other known Democrats that may run in 2020, they are also called former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden said he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Paylin mentions PTSD Trek Paylin in a rally to support Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Trek Paylin spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence, and the incident occurred on Monday night.
"What my son is going through right now, which he's going through on his return, can only understand other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are returning home with," she said in front of a rally to support Donald Trump in the city of Tals, Oklahoma.
Paylin called the arrest of Treka "a problem that no one pays attention to" and said that her son and other war veterans "return home not as they used to be, more cruel, and want to know whether they respected here what their fellow soldiers, pilots and other military personnel did for this country."
According to a spokesman for the police department in Vasila, Dan Bennett, Trek was arrested on Monday in the town of Vasila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on women, as well as with obstructing reports of violence and carrying weapons of alcohol abuse.
18 states, and D.C. support complaints of asylum policy
Eighteen states and the district of Colombia support a new U.S. policy of denying refugee status to victims of banditry and domestic violence.
According to the NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district sent an analytical note to the court consultant in Washington to support a plaintiff who needed shelter and accused the above - mentioned policy in court.
The full name of the suitor in the Grace vs. Seshns case for the U.S. Civil Rights Alliance, which is accused of federal politics and which was filed in August, does not open up.
The caller claimed that her partner, "and his cruel sons-bands," had beaten her, but the U.S. officials refused her when she asked for refuge on July 20th.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
Public prosecutors in support of Grace's lawsuits said that people in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (infants who often seek refuge in the United States) often face such serious problems as banditry and domestic violence.
The new refugee status policy cancels the decision of the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014, according to which undocumented immigrants who fled domestic violence could request asylum.
The district attorney general Carl Reissin stated during his Friday speech that the new policy "disappears decades of state, federal and international laws".
"Federal law requires that the application for refugee status be based on the facts and circumstances set forth in such a statement and that the prohibition violates this principle," says the court consultant's analytical note.
Then, in an analytical note, prosecutors argue that a policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the United States is damaging the country's economy, because they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "fill up the necessary labour resources."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessins issued an order for immigration judges, saying that they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
"The asylum is granted to those persons who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with race, religion, nationality, membership in certain social groups or political views," Sess stated in the June 11th policy presentation.
A shelter was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers desperately seek to find those who remain alive while the death toll in Palo has doubled
For those who remain alive, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with fever at the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, quick help brings the body.
Clean water is not enough."
Some people return to their ruined homes, reap the sunken benefits, and try to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people are traumatized, and hospitals damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including two Gerris with a fractured back and shoulder, are resting near the building of an army hospital named Pala, where patients are provided with open - air care because of repeated shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he remembered how intensely he shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I was trapped in the wreckage of the wall," said Geris, an Associated Press correspondent, adding that he and his family came to town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife beg for help and then reigned in silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "improvement psychological pressure" by means of "proclaims containing propaganda"
A week after the national Chinese newspaper posted advertisements on four pages of the American daily publication regarding the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's payroll in Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa after China's indictment of trying to influence Congress elections on November 6th, China rejects these accusations.
According to Reuters officials in the U.S., Trump's statement that he accuses Beijing of trying to intervene in the U.S. elections means a new phase of escalation by Washington, whose goal is to pressure China.
Although foreign governments can place advertisements to boost trade, there is an escalation in trade war between Beijing and Washington, during which they have already increased their duties on imports.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the imposition of a repressive bribe in China was intended to strike exporters from states such as Iowa, who supported the Republic's Trump Party.
Terry Branstead, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, China’s largest exporter of agricultural products, said that China had harmed American workers, farmers, and companies.
China, as Branstead wrote in the Des Moines Register Sunday release column, "encourages the pressure by publishing a propaganda advertisement in our independent press."
"To promote propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American people's tradition of freedom of speech and press independence by posting a pay advertisement at Des Moines Register," Branstead wrote.
"On the contrary, on the street schedules here in Beijing, you will find only individual voices of the dissidents; here you will not see the true reflection of what the Chinese people are really thinking about the direction of development of the Chinese economy, which raises concerns, which leads to the conclusion that China's media is under reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the important Chinese editions suggested publishing" his article, but he did not say what it was.
Analysts warn that by the collapse of Kavanaugh, Republicans are setting up women voters against themselves before the mid-term elections.
Since many well - known Republicans support and protect a candidate for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh after he has been charged with sexual harassment, analysts warn that this may cause an unwanted reaction to the upcoming midterm elections, especially in women.
In the midst of this situation, passions are aroused, and most Republicans publicly claim that they would like to go to the polls.
Such things can't just be played back," he said during an interview with The Hill published on Saturday, Grant Riger, professor of political science at Maxwell Syracuse University.
Reeger doubted that the FBI's investigation, on which Senator Jeff Flake (Republic of Arizona) at the last minute, would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
As reported in Washington, D.C., Chief Counselor and Spokeswoman of the Progressive MoveOn Group, Catherine Jean-Perry said on Friday, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget about it tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, Friday morning the protestors sang "The November is approaching!" during a demonstration at the Legal Committee, when the Republicans decided to move on to the confirmation of Kavanaugh's candidature, despite Dr. Christine Blazey Ford's testimony.
In an interview with the news website, Stu Rottenberg, a non-party political observer, said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"They say it already is, and it's true.
However, motivation may increase, especially in women voters from 18 to 29 years of age, who have not yet been identified and often do not vote if they do not like the president."
Even before Ford testified in connection with the charges against the Supreme Court judge for sexual crimes, analysts predicted a negative voter response if Republicans insisted on a hard-on.
As NBC News reports, earlier this week's former head of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steele, stated, "This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
In an interview with the news channel, the U.S. Director of Priorities (the group that helps in the election campaign for Democrats) Guy Cecil, "not in the vote of the committee, the final vote or the fact that Kavanaugh ended up on the bench of the defendants, but in the way they responded to the situation and how they acted on it."
Yet, the thoughts of the Americans as to whose testimony to believe, Ford or Kavanaugh, have been divided.
According to a new survey by YouGov 41% of respondents believe or rather believe Ford's testimony, while Kavanaugh's testimony believes or rather believes 35% of the respondents.
In addition, 38% of the respondents said that they thought that Kavanaugh was giving or was likely to give false testimony, while 30% of the respondents said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, after pressured by Fleek, the FBI conducts a review of the charges filed by Ford and another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under the oath of the Senate Legal Committee about how Kavanaugh attacked her while in a state of drunkenness when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez stated that he was a candidate for the Supreme Court's office and showed her his genitals at a party during their schooling at the Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a "new Internet" to create Google and Facebook competition
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Internet, launches a new startup to create Facebook, Amazon and Google competition.
The latest project of the world's technology legend, Inrupt, is developing a platform with an open source Solid code, whose idea belongs to Berners-Lea.
With a Solid platform, users can choose where to store data and who to access information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the Inrupt goal was "world domination."
'We must do it now,' he said about the start-up.--
This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows users to create a "personal online data storage" or a PO.
It may contain contact lists, lists of current affairs, calendar, audio library, and other tools for personal use and work.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in the same browser at the same time.
The unique feature of this personal online data store is that it fully meets the needs of a user who can access any information.
The company calls it "the expansion of personal capabilities through data."
According to Director General Inrupt John Bruce, the company aims to activate resources, processes, and skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM security platform, several permanent developers hired to work on the project, and a software community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete replacement when all their business models are in a very short period of time.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a Saturday publication in Medium Berners-Lee wrote that the mission of Inrupt was to "provide commercial energy and ecosystem and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created by the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing a World Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee is an influential figure in the debate on online neutrality.
Even at the time of the launch, Inrupt Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Coin Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of networking," Berners Lee added.
Bernard Vann: festivities for the service of the church to the Order of the Victoria Cross during World War I
The only member of the Church of England who received the Order of Victoria's Cross for taking part in the fighting during World War I is honored in his hometown in 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann received the award for his participation in the Belglais and Leocur attack on September 29, 1918.
However, he died four days later from a sniper’s bullet and never learned that he had won Britain’s highest military prize.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren discovered a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rashden, County of Northamptonshire.
One of his grandkids, Michael Vann, called it "extremely symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone occurred exactly 100 years after his grandfather performed the feat for which he received the prize.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Wang transferred his battalion through the St.Catten Canal "through a very dense mist and under a dense fire of field cannons and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the firehouse and with the "excruciating bravery" led the line forward, before which one broke through to the field cannon and destroyed three cannons of the enemy squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Vann said that his grandfather did something he could never do again and that he deserved respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, placed the crown after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he feels very proud to be in this parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown by the honor he is shown by so many people."
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they were shown "Pepp Pig"
Imagine not sleeping all night just to watch the events of Bellator 206, and you are denied the opportunity to review the main event.
In the San José tournament, 13 fights were recorded, including six main shows that were broadcast live in the night in Britain on 5 channels.
At 6 a.m., just before Gegard Moussa and Rory McDonald were preparing to meet together, television broadcasters in Britain died of surprise when Peppa's lead appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting.
Some were not thrilled because they had not slept until morning, waiting for battle.
One of the fans wrote in Twitter that switching to a children's cartoon seemed to him to be "some kind of failed joke."
"According to the government's decree that the content that was broadcast at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they had to broadcast the baby," said Dave Schwarz, senior vice president of marketing and public relations with Bellator when he was asked about television,
"Peppa Pig," yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Coker promised to work on a broadcast schedule to capture viewers in Britain in the future.
"I think that if we talk about a repeat broadcast, we can arrange it," said Kouker.
"But now there's Sunday, 6 a.m., and we won't be able to do anything until Sunday comes and they have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we had a lot of messages that we were responding to, and the text was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical failure, and we tried to remove it.
However, it was found to be inconsistent with government rules.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We're going to shorten the tournament to five more fights instead of six, as usual, and we've been trying to reroute the signal to the fans, but we've had these attempts delayed so far.
It's a really bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt worse because of his sexual orientation.
The Olympic Water Jumper Tom Daley tells us that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't understand that "not everyone looks like him" until he went to high school.
While participating in Desert Island Discs (Districts of the Wild Island) on Radio 4 led by Lauren Laverne, he pointed out that he spoke frankly about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also claimed that because of his fatherhood, he became less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
Karsty Young, who has been leading the program for a long time, went to the hospital for a few months.
When he came as a couple on the first program of Laverne, Daley said he felt worse than anyone else when he was a kid, because "the society didn't see it when the boys and girls liked it."
He said, "So far, the sense of inferiority and difference has been precisely what gave me strength and strength to achieve success."
He said he wanted to prove that something was "worthy" not to disappoint all those who finally learned about his orientation.
A two-time bronze olympic prism became a prominent LBGT community rights fighter and took advantage of the appearance at this year's Games of Association in Australia to encourage more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He stated that he spoke frankly about his views because he felt happy that he could live without any consequences, and he wanted to give this "hope" to others.
A three - time world champion admitted that feeling for a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, was a real surprise to him.
Daley married an Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him, but last year, he said, the age difference was never a problem.
"When you've been through so much at this young age" (in the first Olympics he was 14 years old, and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone his age who would have survived the same kind of takeoff and fall.
In June, there was a son who was called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and since then, according to Daley, his "worldly acceptance" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would only think about what I should get gold," he said.
"You know, there are things far more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named Robert's father, who died in 2011, 40 years after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father could not accept the thought of the end, and before he died, he asked if they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't sit in the front row because you won't be around anymore," Daley said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and gained bronze.
"I knew that's what I had dreamed of all my life: diving in front of my fellow countrymen at the Olympics, and there was no feeling better than that," Daley said.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song, the Proud (Gordy) in the performance of Geiser Small, which he reasoned with when preparing for the Olympic Games and still calls for ants.
Desert Island Discs comes out on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. English summer time.
On Saturday at the Battle of Ryder's Cub, they took out Michelangelo, who was out of shape.
The American, Phil Michelson, will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game in the Ryder Cup tournament, but he has to re-establish the form so that he doesn't get unhappy with the event.
Michelson, who is a record 12th time in a tournament that takes place once every two years, led Captain Jim Furick out of the game at the time of the forts and forts.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did in playing for the United States, a five-time winner has been cheering up the team all day and training on the side, hoping to master his emotions.
Because Michelson was not famous for his fine strokes even while he was on top of his career, a 48-year-old athlete was not exactly suited for the complex golf course Le Golf National, where Raf usually punishes for straying blows.
And if the field isn't so much an obstacle, then in the ninth match on Sunday, Michelangelo will have to meet the Open Champion and the master of the exact hit by Francesco Molinari, who won all of his matches this week with his new Tommy Fleetwood.
If Americans who are three points behind after 12 single matches start well, the match of Michelangelo can be decisive.
Furic expressed confidence in his athlete, and he probably had nothing else to add.
"He fully understood his role today, clapped me on my back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furik.
"He has no doubt in his power.
Michelson is a member of the Hall of Fame, which has done so much for the teams in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I've been predicting more matches, but that's what happened, so we decided to do it.
He wants to be there in the field, just like anyone else."
If Michelangelo goes out on Saturday, Nick Faldo's record, which was the largest match in the Raider Club.
On this he may end his career in the Ryder Cub, which never matched his individual achievements.
In the account of Michelangelo, 18 won, 20 defeats, and 7 nocturnal results, but Furic said that his presence could play a decisive role for the team.
"He's funny, he's yummy, he's funny, he's funny, he likes to joke with others, he's a guy who's cool to have on the team," Furiq explained.
"I think the younger players had a good time, coming upon him as well as this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He's more than just a player."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a big breakup is not going to solve anything.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from the experience that a sharp break from the single matches of the last day of the Ryder Cub doesn't guarantee victory yet.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in a match at the Valderram club, where a team led by Sevo Ballesteros preceded the Americans by five points, but won a match with a slight breakup with 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big break in the Valderram field; a big break in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in the Valderram field where we won the force," said Bjorn after watching the winning games Class 2018 with a score of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at Le Golf National Stadium, after which the breakup is 10:6.
So history teaches me and every team player that nothing has yet been solved.
Tomorrow we have to play with maximum payback.
Go out into the field and do whatever is necessary.
The game will be over only after the result appears on the board.
We have the goal of winning this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said before, I focus on 12 players in our team, but we are well aware of who is opposed to us, the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in the complicated field, Bjorn added, "I will never run ahead.
Tomorrow, things might be different.
We're due for individual matches tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's great to play field with your partner when it's going well, but it's just when you're standing there alone, and you can see what you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how players need to be set up tomorrow: at the limit of opportunity.
You leave your partner without support and now he also has to show you what he's capable of."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite number of Jim Furic expects his partners to play a better game at an individual level, except for Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Until Furika himself, fate on the last day was coming back to different sides: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but he was defeated when a team from Europe created "The Miracle in Medina."
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, organized players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone’s side, players in the middle of the distance experience special pressure.
We put the players in the team properly, so we're going, like, to do something amazing tomorrow."
Thomas is charged with trying to lead the counterattack against Rory McElroy, and then Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter.
"These partners alone, and in that order, I chose because I wanted to evenly distribute my efforts throughout the game," Bjorn commented on his choice of players for individual matches.
The reintroduction of a new German warship was postponed
The most modern frigate of the German Navy was scheduled to take effect in 2014 instead of the obsolete warships of the Cold War, but, according to local media, this would not happen at least until next year because of the malfunctioning systems and the rapid increase in spending.
According to the Die Zeit newspaper, received from the military intelligence spokesman, the entry into force of the Rainland-Pfalz ship, the main vessel of the most modern frigate class Baden-Württemberg, was postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery damaged the implementation of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg class ships, which the Navy ordered in 2007, have to replace the obsolete Bremen class frigates.
Clearly, they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a set of antiaircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some techniques to reduce visibility, such as radiolocation, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is the extended period of technical supply, and new frigates are expected to be able to avoid returning to the base port for about two years.
Journalists Die Zeit warn, however, that due to continuing delays in modern warships, which were to increase Germany’s military capacity at sea, they will also become obsolete at the time of deployment.
A multi-traveling frigate F125 got into the headlines last year when Germany's naval forces officially refused to bring the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first case of the return of the military ship to the shipbuilding company after delivery.
The reasons for the return are not known, but the German media mentioned significant "software and equipment malfunctions" which made the warship unfit for military operations.
Weaknesses of software are particularly important because the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class consists of about 120 sailors -- only half of the military who served in the old Bremen class.
In addition, it has been found that the vessel has a significant surplus of weight, which makes its performance worse and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
It is believed that the Rainland Pfaltz frigate is twice as heavy (7,000 tons) as ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, another problem has been the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of preparing the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euros have turned into a colossal 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion United States dollars).
The problems of getting new frigates have gained special importance in the light of recent warnings of the decline of the German Navy.
Early in the year, Bundestag was informed by Hans-Peter Bartels that the Navy of the countries had "less ships fit for combat."
The official stated that the situation had deteriorated dramatically for a time, since the old ships had been out of operation and the new vessels had not arrived.
He expressed deep regret that none of the frigates in Baden-Württemberg class could fill the Navy.
National Trust to Watch the Secret Life of Bats
A new study in Scotland's highlands area aims to establish how bats use landscapes to search for food.
Scientists hope that the data obtained will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to take steps to preserve them in the future.
In the Gardens of Inver, in Wester-Ross, scientists at the Scottish National Trust will observe species like bats of dwarfs and bats of pygmies, as well as the smell of a common and watery nocturnal.
Special registrators will be placed in strategic locations in the land tenure area to observe bat behavior during the season.
Workers and volunteers of the Scottish National Trust will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to establish the frequency and belonging of bats.
Then it's going to develop a detailed map of animal habitation and prepare a report to link animal behavior to their habitat.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser in Scotland’s National Trust, hopes that the results of the study will help determine which areas are most important for bats and how they are used for each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of conservation measures (e.g. meadow formation) and determine best practices for forest conservation for bats and other related species.
During the last century, bat populations have declined considerably in Scotland and Britain.
They are threatened with active construction and development that robs them of nesting sites.
Other negative factors include wind and lighting, fly glue, chemical treatment of building materials, and attacks on the home.
In fact, the lepers are not blind.
However, hunting at night helps their ears to catch prey more effectively than their eyes.
They use complex echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles to flight trajectory.
In Scotland’s National Trust, which has over 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens of special importance and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country are very serious about bat problems.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct research, nesting tests, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts have even created the first and only bat shelter in Scotland, and it's located in the area of Triv in the Damfries-end-Hallaway area, where eight out of ten bats live in Scotland have been found sheltered.
David Thompson, the city manager, claims to be the perfect place for them.
"In the area of the square there were wonderful conditions for bats," he assures.
"There are old buildings, many huge trees and other favourable living conditions.
But we still need to know a lot about bats, because of the research we're doing here and elsewhere, we're going to be able to learn more about what they need to do to thrive."
He insists that it is very important to check the area for bats before doing any technical work, because the unintentional destruction of one nesting site to remove a youngster could kill up to 400 females and babies, which would likely cause the destruction of the entire local population.
The animals are forbidden to kill, torture, or harass.
Elizabeth Ferrrell, an officer of the Scottish bat conservation center, urged the public to join the organization.
She said, "We still need to know a lot about our bats, and we haven't yet revealed the characteristics of many species."
Ronaldo rejects the rape charges, and his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against the German edition
Kristian Ronaldo called the rape charge "trap" and said that people "try to draw attention to themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which has published suspicious information.
The American woman Catherine Majorga accused the Portugal-County Front and the Juventus Football Club of rape in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
According to Der Spiegel on Friday, Ronaldo allegedly paid her $375,000 for his silence.
A few hours after the indictments were filed, 33-year-old Ronaldo turned to 142 million of his fans in the Instagram video, calling the appropriate messages "nalep".
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are slander," the five-time Golden Ball master made a statement on camera.
"They want to get their attention using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to take advantage of me, but similar situations are part of my job.
I am a happy person and I have everything good," added the football player, smiling.
According to the Reuters news agency, Ronaldo's attorneys are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the charges they have issued, which they call "an inadmissible report of suspicion in the sphere of private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that a football player would demand compensation for "moral damage in size that corresponds to the seriousness of a violation which is probably one of the most violent cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at the Ronaldo and Majorga nightclub, they returned to the player’s number, where he allegedly raped her anally.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and said that he was a "99 percent good guy" who was downed by "one percent."
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with a model, but with mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police, and then to the hospital where the injuries she suffered were photographed, but later she agreed to the vascular settlement because she was "feared of revenge" and was warned of "public humiliation."
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel her previous appointment because she's still suffering from an incident she said had occurred.
At the time of Ronaldo's incident, he was preparing to move to FC Real Madrid from FC Manchester United this summer, and this summer he became a Grand of Italian Football, the Juventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brixit: Britain will "sorry long" for the loss of auto-producers
Britain will regret it long if it loses its position as a world leader in auto-production after Brexit, as Secretary of Economics Greg Clark warns.
He added that he was thrilled by the statements made by representatives of Toyota UK, who told BBC journalists that in the case of Britain's exit from the EU without a deal, the company would have to suspend production and the work of its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Minister Clark assures us.
The Japanese automaker claimed that the effects of delays on the border in the case of Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The plant in Bernaston, where Toyota’s cars are manufactured in Auris and Avensis, released about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain left the EU urgently at the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota, Bernaston.
Other auto-producers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about the impact of Britain's exit from the EU without an agreement on international trade.
For example, BMW stated that the Mini model factory in Oxford would be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of auto-producers are that Brexit, without agreement, can cause risks to supply chains.
Toyota Production Line operates in the operating mode of delivery of details and materials according to needs, details come every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the EU leaves the EU without agreement on March 29th, there may be disruptions in the supply of details that will lead to delays and shortages of materials.
According to the company, Toyota can be used to place details for no more than one day, so production will have to be stopped.
Greg Clark noted that the plan for organizing a relationship with the EU, prepared by Teresa May (Chequers Plan), "in part provides schemes for avoiding problems across the border."
"We need a deal, we need to make an optimal deal, which I think will not only enable us to succeed at the moment, but also take advantage of the perspectives that have emerged," he said during Today's broadcast programme at BBC Radio 4.
"In view of the testimony of Toyota's representatives, as well as other auto-producers, we must preserve the formed high-performance supply chains."
Toyota has not been able to tell how long production will be stopped, but in the long run, it is expected that spending increases will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and, as a result, reduce jobs.
Peter Zivaris, head of the Unite Professional Association in the Bernaston factory, who worked here for 24 years, said that the other participants were extremely concerned: "I can say from experience that short jobs are not being restored."
The government representative said, "We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan to shape our future relations with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein may meet again, noted in the White House
According to White House officials on Sunday, a responsible meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for a week", while discussions are ongoing on the issue of the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court Judge.
Rosenstein controls the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, the links between Trapp and Russia's assistants, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
For several months in Washington, D.C., they are discussing the possibility of releasing the Attorney General's deputy to endanger Muller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about the use of microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of a timely termination of the president's authority for the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House in the background of reports that the official was about to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he wouldn't want to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence in time with the Senate Legal Committee, where they were supposed to testify to Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly investigation of the FBI's charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Press Secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, performed on the Fox News Sunday TV show.
When she asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There is no date for the meeting, and maybe it will take place this week, and I expect it to be postponed for a week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But let's see, I keep an eye on the press for the last piece of information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders did not conduct media briefings at the White House on September 10th.
Chris Wallace, the leader, asked why.
Sanders replied that the frequent briefings were not about the hostility of the public, although she added, "I won't deny that they're playing the public."
Then she assumed that Trump himself would communicate more with the press.
"The President answers questions more often than any president to him," she said, adding without referring to the source, "Statistics speaks for itself."
Sanders pointed out that briefings will still be held, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions to the President of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We've been trying to communicate with the press a lot, and this is supposed to be particularly noticeable over the last few weeks, and the ability to talk to the President of the United States is no worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences with high-level guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York City this week, the president may have shown why this is the case, acting in front of journalists in a calm and sometimes odd way.
Scotland's State Secretary of Health addressed workers from the EU in response to Brexit concerns
The Secretary of State for Health addressed citizens from other EU countries who work in the National Health Service in Scotland to express their appreciation for their work and ask them to continue it after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already made commitments to cover the cost of applying for permanent resettlement for EU citizens working in autonomous government services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman stated: "During the summer, negotiations between Britain and the EU on the issue of exit have been held, and it is already this autumn that decisions must be made.
But the British government is strengthening preparations for a possible deal-free.
I know that this period can be very alarming for you.
That is why I would like to stress again how much I appreciate every employee's contribution, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union and countries within it share valuable experience and skills, strengthening and improving the work of the health service for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay."
Christian Ebercrombie underwent an emergency operation after head trauma
Tennessy State Tigers' half-protector, Christian Ebercrombie, carried on an urgent operation after receiving head trauma in Sunday's match against the Wanderbilt Commodores, which his team lost at 31:27.
The head coach of Tennessee State Tigers told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He came to the side line where he got sick," said Reed.
On the side line, coaches and medical personnel gave Ebercromby oxygen before taking it to carry out further testing.
The official representative of Tennessee State Tigers informed Chris Garris of WSMV, Nashville, Tennessee, that Ebercrombie was operating at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no evidence of the type and severity of the trauma yet." The Tennessee State Tigers team is trying to find out when the player got injured.
Ebercrombie, a second-grader, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after switching from Illinois.
He performed five ball grabs on Sunday before leaving the game, so during the season he had 18 captures.
Foreign buyers will pay more government fees in case of real estate purchases in Britain
Foreign buyers will pay more toll if property is purchased in Britain, and according to new plans, Tori will spend more money to help the homeless
This move neutralizes all Corbin’s attempts to involve young voters
Higher government fees will be collected from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The Ministry of Finance expects an additional 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
As Teresa May announced today, foreigners buying real estate in Britain will pay more tolls, and additional expenses will be spent on helping the homeless.
This step can be viewed as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin’s efforts to involve young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing targeted at highly paid workers.
The increase in customs will apply to physical and legal persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional funds will be paid by the government to help those who are forced to sleep in the open air.
An additional bribe, accompanied by an increase in the two - year - old’s housing and real estate for rent, may amount to three percent.
In the Ministry of Finance, an additional 120 million pounds a year are expected to be involved.
According to experts, 13% of the new real estate built in London is owned by foreign citizens, which leads to higher prices and complicates the task of those who only dream of their own housing.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, are deserted because the vast number of foreign buyers spend most of their time abroad.
A new plan of action came up just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a downturn in the government to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by buying up the land without further use, and he urged Teresa May to give up the quotas for available real estate to correct the "disgusting situation in the housing market" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of important real estate reforms, such as rent control and circumvention without valid grounds.
He also suggests extending the authority of local councils in the area of new housing.
Teresa May said, "I promised last year that I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream -- for every new generation of life, it must be better.
This requires a change in our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
It is not fair, however, that individuals who do not live in Britain as well as foreign companies buy housing on the same terms as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become unattainable, and the problem of living in the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "More than anything, I want to be the head coach of Scotland's collective team."
The head coach, "Sanderland" Jack Ross, claims that "over all things" he ever wants to lead the Scottish collection.
A 42-year-old Scottish man went to rebuild a club from the northeast of the country, which now holds third place in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to Stadium of Light this summer, returning last season's St. Mary's in the Premier League of Scotland.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I went to Scotland's second collection, but it's over," Ross told the sportsound program at BBC Scotland.
"When I was a kid, my father and I used to watch a game of collecting Scotland at the Gapden Park Stadium." I was always attracted to it.
The only hope for me is to be successful in being the head coach of the club."
Ross' predecessors at the Sanderland FC were Dick Lawyer, David Moes, Sam Ellardace, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
Former head coach Alloa Atletik says he felt no excitement from the transition to the big club following such authoritative names, precipitating offers from the FK "Barnsley" and "Ipswich Town."
"At the current stage, I think it's a success if the club returns to the Premier League.
Thanks to its structure and technological support, this club no doubt corresponds to the level of the Premier League," he noted.
"It'll be a difficult task, but the other result is unlikely to be a success for me."
Ross has only been building a coaching career for three years, and he's worked as a second coach at the Dambarton FK and spent 15 months at the Harts coaching station.
Then he helped Alloa get dressed after the FK got to the third division, and in the next season from Saint Meirren went from the departure stage to the winning title of the first division.
According to Ross, he's now more comfortable than ever during his career at the FC "Clide," "Hartlpool," "Folkerk," "Saint-Mirren" and "Hamilton Academy."
"I'm at a crossroads," he said, referring to the transition to the FC "Alloa."
"I sincerely believed that coaching was more appropriate to me than playing games.
This sounds strange, since I was successful, well earned and reached certain heights.
But playing is not easy.
There are many challenges that need to be overcome every week.
I still face them through stress and stress, but as a head coach, I feel in my place.
I've always been interested in coaching, and I've never felt as comfortable in my entire adult life as when I chose this profession."

Study: 17:30 Sunday – ideal time for a beer mug
The summer heat helped to increase the profits of British pubs who are experiencing less than the best of times, but increased pressure on the restaurant’s network.
According to the calculations, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The author of the CGA’s development consulting organization Peter Martin stated: “Because of the sun’s weather and longer than expected, in England’s World Cup, July passed the same pattern as last month, when the proceeds of the pubs grew by 2.8%, and the restaurant business went even worse.
The June fall was 1.8% in July.
The pubs and bars, which are focused on the supply of beverages, while they have the best rates, their growth is equal to the loss of restaurants.
The pubs in which food is served also suffered from heat, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems that only a drink is of interest to visitors.
In controlled pubs and bars, drinks increased by 6.6% a month, while food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst at the law enforcement and firm business department in RSM, said, "We have seen similar trends since late April.
Weather and large - scale social or sporting events remain the main factors affecting domestic sales.
Not surprisingly, groups of restaurants continue to lose profits, the annual fall in sales by 4.8% has caused particular concern about the need to cut costs.
The long summer is not the best time for food-giving institutions, so let's see if the moderate temperature we've seen in August can give them the necessary rest."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowing down of new brands.
Galuze indicator of the sales of Coffer Peach Tracker in the U.K. pubs, bars and restaurants is a reflection of the collected and analyzed performance indicators of 47 working groups, whose total turnover exceeds £9 billion.
Every fifth child has a social network account hidden from their parents.
According to research results, 1 out of 5 children, sometimes under 11 years of age, have hidden accounts from their parents and teachers on social networks.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fiction pages in Instagram
This news has raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual matters
20% of students report having a parent account that shows to their parents
Every fifth child, sometimes under 11 years of age, creates an account on social networks that hides from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictional pages in Instagram, a social network for the exchange of photographs.
This news has raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual matters.
20% of the students reported having a clean "core" account that shows them to their parents, as well as one or more private ones.
A mother who happened to come across a secret page of her 13-year-old daughter saw the call "rape me."
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmisters' Conference (HMC) in private schools revealed that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles on social networks. Half of these children have admitted that an additional account is secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "We are very concerned about the fact that many teenagers feel they want to create an online space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elide Doyle will be the "athletics representative" of the Scottish Athletics Council.
Elide Doyle was elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics as an independent director during the annual general councils of members of the government.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning athlete, and the head of the Yean Beatty Council has described this step as a great opportunity for those who lead sports, to take advantage of its extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Ellid enjoys great respect among the athletes of Scotland, Great Britain and the world, and we are convinced that by involving her in the council, the athletic sport in Scotland will be of great benefit," Beatty said.
Doyle said, "I'm inspired to be a representative of the athletes' interests, and I hope I can really benefit and promote sports in Scotland."
An American, a four - time Olympic champion who won 200 - 400 - foot [200 - 400 m] races in Atlanta in 1996 and now a sports viewer for the BBC, lost his ability to walk through a transitory ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors claimed that only time would tell me if I could recover and how much.
I have learned to walk again, and I am doing dynamic exercises today!
Thank you for the words of support!"
Women were compared to cows in milk - Internet users' opinions split
A dairy producer has encountered a mixed reaction of Internet users to advertising, where young mothers are compared to actual cows.
To mark the release of a product called "the world's first silent milk-smoker", the technology-consumer company Elvie released an ad in the style of humorous music video to demonstrate the freedom afforded to mothers by a new vacuum cleaner.
Four real mothers dance in a blue cowshed under a song that says, "Yes, I feed alone, but I don't have a tail," and, "If you see for yourself, it's not a wash, it's my breasts."
The choir goes on to say, "Smooth, suck up to feed the children, suck off, suck away the milk so that it doesn't waste."
However, an advertisement posted on Facebook led to a heated discussion online.
The video has gained 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the reactions of the Internet users have been mixed, and many have noted that the advertising underestimates the "awesome organization" of the production of milk in industry.
"It's not a very wise decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and have a baby to give milk, but their children are being badly taken away from them a few days after birth," one of the users wrote.
Elvie can easily be hidden in Elvie/Mother’s bra.
And here's another comment: "Of course it's traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not include them for a milk-drink advertisement for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone else said, "This ad is far from reality."
Some of the other users were defending ad, and one of the women's videos appeared to be "very fun."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would certainly have bought such a thing if I still had breast - feeding.
When I sucked away the milk, I felt really like a cow.
The commercial is kind of crazy, but I wasn't looking for a hidden purpose in it.
A wonderful product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "Beautiful advertising directed at mothers who suck away milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This advertisement is not about highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show milk-drivers hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on information that many women who use similar products feel cowlike.
However, the vacuum cleaner Elvie works absolutely silently, has no wires or pipes, and easily hides in a bra, which allows women to move freely, hold their children, and even go outside.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother's advertising agency, commented on this situation: "Elvie's suckler was such a revolutionary product that he demanded a bright and provocative presentation.
Having done a parallel between women who are healing milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the characteristics of breastfeeding, in an exciting and interesting way, showing the incredible sense of freedom that a new suckler would bring.
It's not the first time Elvie's been sucked into headlines.
Within the Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the podium with this product while displaying the clothing from the modeler Martha Yakobowski.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply, although the number of monthly crossings of the border has remained relatively constant, partly because harsh rhetoric and politics by the Trump administration have complicated the placement of children in caregivers.
Traditionally, in most cases, caregivers themselves performed without documents, and now they are afraid to put at risk their own opportunity to stay in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
Risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to fingerprint and that the data would be transmitted to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, the head of the Bureau for Immigration and Customs Control, testified to Congress that the Bureau staff had arrested dozens of people who had applied for care of minors without escort.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of those who are caregivers or members of their households are illegally in the country, many of whom are foreigners who committed offences.
That is why we continue to persecute these people," said Mr. Albens.
According to the employees of the shelter to deal with children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear in court within a month after the arrest, not 60 days, as before.
Many of them will be able to use videoconferencing instead of coming to court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who, according to the court’s decision, are not entitled to a shelter will be deported quickly.
According to the employees, shelter and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer the children stay on guard, the greater the likelihood that they will experience anxiety or depression.
Lawyers claim that these problems are increasing in institutions of greater size, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological condition of children.
They added that by moving the children to a tent and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to friends, we risk increasing the trauma that many of them have suffered.
Syria has ordered the U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Moreover, speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though war has been going on in the country for the eighth year.
Mualem, who also works as deputy prime minister, claimed that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism, so "putting them right."
"They must go immediately and not make the terms," he said at the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war on terrorism was actually over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people had died since 2011 and millions had left their homes.
He claimed that Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we had cleared all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has deployed some 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mostly teaching and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar Al-Assad.
In a war - ravaged country, France sent more than 1,000 soldiers.
With regard to refugees, Mualem assured us that the country had the right conditions for their return, and he also accused "some Western countries" of spreading unfounded fears, which made refugees not dare to return.
"We have called for international cooperation and humanitarian organizations to help people come back," he said.
"We're seeing an attempt to politicize a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that they will not assist Syria in restoring the country until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats will report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone around Idlib, the last large plot of rebels, has created an opportunity for the continuation of political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on the province of which three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had "clear terms", and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including Al-Qaeda-related fighters, the An-Nusr Front, who would "be destroyed".
United Nations emissary Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee in the near future, which will be composed of government representatives and oppositions to develop a postwar constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Mualem set out conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that his work should be limited by "review of articles of a valid constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Be Transformed
According to this logic, Trump can be converted in 2020 if, perhaps, many liberal viewers are hoping, he does not constitute a mandate in time after the scandal and impeachment.
No doubt that would be the most dramatic conclusion of the presidency of all time!
At the moment, the viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in Prime Time has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on CNN and has virtually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in Prime Time, compared to 1.7 million people four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC cable channel has been at the top of the ratings of 3.5 million viewers in the evening when major news is being discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our understanding," said Neil Behr, executive producer of the Last Candidate drama on the ABC channel about the Secretary of State becoming president after the devastating attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scowell, an experienced humorist writer and author of the book "Just Funny Moments: as well as a few harsh truths about entry into the Hollywood Men Club" suggests another theory.
She recalled a trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he said.
Chaos entertains.
Of course, unlike any other TV content, Washington stories are able to determine the future of Roe's case against Wade, the possibility of unifying immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
Subtraction is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed about citizens when you spend six hours watching a group of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodwood's "well-known" sources for your book "Fear," Paul Manafort's jacket of the ostrich skin for 15,000 dollars ("dress for arrogant" -- so wrote in The Washington Post) and the consequences of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy, published by Stormy Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be my ex again.
"The sense of reality-show is partly related to what is new to you every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the author of the Lombard Star program, about rotations in the acting composition and daily plots on the Trump show (the NFL conflict, support by Kim Chen-in).
If you allow yourself to miss one episode, you can fall back hopelessly.
When I was able to meet Mr. Flies at his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, there was warm sunlight (27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and writing CNN.
He could not break away from the TV — not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Legal Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on the line.
"I remember how we did all those crazy shows in our time, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flace told me.
"I took it as a joke, but they seemed to be right."

External embezzlement of funds in the harshest midterm elections in Congress
No wonder the 17th District of Pennsylvania has an extra cash flow, because two valid congressmen are fighting for a single chair through a review of the electoral district.
The struggle for this suburban district of Pittsburgh, which was recently changed, involves a Democrat, a member of Conor Lemb’s House of Representatives, who won another district in an additional election last spring.
The Lamb is opposed to another congressman, a republican Keith Rothfs, who is now representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders are very much in line with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old boundaries of the districts were designated for the benefit of Republicans contrary to the Constitution.
The pre-election races in the new 17th district sparked a strong confrontation between the financial divisions of the major parties, the United States Democratic Party Committee from the congress elections (DCC) and the National Committee of the Republic Party (NRCC).
Lemba's name became very famous in Pennsylvania after winning the 18th district's minimum victory in an additional March election to Congress, which was used by the public at large.
President Donald Trump won the 20-point championship in this district.
Political experts have given little advantage to Democrats.
In the United States, the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China was considered, but they changed their mind.
The diplomats recalled Washington’s weak opposition to the activities of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel, president of Panama, and Trump had a hotel in Panama until his partners recovered the staff hired by Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to call off the heads of diplomatic missions of the United States of America from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama through "the recent decisions on non-recognition of Taiwan", said the press secretary of the Department of Gezer Neuert at the beginning of this month.
But sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received some $140 million in US aid in 2017, particularly in the field of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The fines offered to reduce financial aid and the target visa restrictions would be painful for that country in Central America with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As a result of internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, and a similar move was made last year, and it was considered a step forward in efforts to keep the migration flowing to the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and actually the issue of sanctions against El Salvador had stopped.
According to the diplomats, Vice President Mike Pens is now planning to take part in a conference scheduled for mid-October in order to show that the administration considers this action to be very important.
At the same time, three American messengers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, for there were no new reports or punishments on the part of Washington.
Mr. Bolton's representative at the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions reported by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, under the condition of anonymity.
The information provided by them was confirmed by a foreign analyst, who was close to the administration, who also spoke under the circumstances of anonymity.
Study History
Another problem may be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Muller on the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, a valid confirmation of why you can find it in the publicly available information.
As part of his investigation, Muller is reportedly investigating the possible link between Trump's campaign and the attack on our Russian voting system.
If the influence of Congress moves into other hands, Trump will have to report to the congressmen as well as to the voters and eventually to the single party.
There's a lot of "if" in this case, and I don't want to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, like his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic that will determine the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler if only the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the chance to avoid bloodshed.
History is determined by such turning points, and the immodest movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Trump releases Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mr. Muller's fate depends?
Rosenstein got into trouble even when this newspaper came up with information that last year he offered to secretly record talks with the president and to share his thoughts on the question of the inappropriateness of Trump's position.
Rosenstein described the information in The Times as inaccurate.
"How will we react if the investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's case, which recently started by the FBI, is insufficiently thorough or honest, or if Kavanaugh's candidacy for office in the Supreme Court is confirmed, despite convincing accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And, first of all, will we, in the medium term, vote in favour of those members of Congress who will be able to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that my embassy once occupied.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light Saturday candles on a swastika table.
With this legacy, can I not look with optimism into the future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is looking forward to a meeting with Vienna's Rapid.
The Rangers is taking the Rapids on Thursday, after the impressive Nietzsche in Spain in a game with Villarreal at the beginning of this month, winning the Austrians will provide the Scottish club with a good chance to get out of the G League of Europe.
Because of the knee injury, half-protector Graham Dorrans was able for the first time in the season to play for his team only in a match with Villarreal, which ended with account 2:2. However, he believes that FC Rangers can use this result as a tramplin to achieve more.
"For us, that was a good result, because Villarreal is a strong team," said 31-year-old player.
"We went out to play with hope of getting a point and got one point.
Perhaps at the end of the match, we could go ahead, but in general, nothing can be considered a fair result.
In the first time, the opponent was better, but after the break, we corrected the situation for our benefit.
Thursday will see another important confrontation in the League of Europe.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's not going to be easy, and our future opponents have shown a good result in their last game, but we can count on the support of the sickards, and I'm sure we can fight and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, starting with my injuries and ending with the changes in the club itself, but now the situation has been normalized.
We have a great warehouse, and all the boys are happy.
I hope we can move on, leave the season behind and succeed."
Women lose sleep because of the fear of retirement savings
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they would like to organize self-care, few talked about it with family members.
About half of the people who participated in the study of the company Nationwide said that they had talked to their husband or wife about the value of long - term care.
Only 10% of the respondents talked about it with the kids.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't rush to have a conversation on this," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Group on Life Insurance.
That's where to start.
Talk to your husband or your wife and children: your family will not be able to provide you with the necessary care if you do not give your wishes to your parents in advance.
Ask your consultant and family to determine where and how to receive care, because this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Involve a financial consultant: he can recommend ways to cover the expenses involved.
The sources of funding for long - term care include traditional insurance policies, a hybrid life - insurance policy, or self - insurance at the expense of your own funds (as long as you have money).
Carefully prepare legal documents: This will enable you to avoid legal harassment in advance.
Prepare trust for your representative, who will control your health care and ensure that your wishes are fulfilled if you are unable to do so in person.
In addition, it is recommended that trust be given to money.
Select a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills in case of your incapacity.
Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs immediate medical attention, so he is taken to a hospital.

In Ilfrakuma, a man fired several shots from a pneumatic rifle.
The man fired his pneumatic rifle several times when he returned home from the party.
A 40-year-old victim was in Oxford Grove District in Ilfracum, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The officers described the shooting that took place at 2:30 a.m. in British summer time as "accident."
The patient did not see the attacker.
His wounds are not life - threatening, but the police are searching for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, government officials report, but the number of victims may increase.
Due to the exit of the communications system, officials dealing with humanitarian aid cannot obtain any information from the Dongala Regent, a region north of Palo, near the 7.5-point earthquake epicentre.
After the disaster in Palo, 16,000 people were evacuated.
Consider some basic facts about the city of Palu and the Dongala regency located on Sulawesi.
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 according to figures for 2017.
When the tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi.
According to data for 2017, about 299,200 people live in the administrative region located in the lower part of the province.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sectors of the province's economy, Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
The production of nickel is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovala, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian agency for mitigating the effects of natural disasters in the last 100 years, Pal and Dongala have suffered from tsunamis several times.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of homes destroyed as a result of the Dongala tsunami.
In 1996, Tsunami also covered the western part of Dongal, then nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located in a seismic Pacific fire ring and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
The following are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: December 26, a strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceg, in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, resulting in the deaths of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the province of Aceg.
2005: At the end of March, at the beginning of April, a series of powerful earthquakes collapsed on the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 points hit the south of Java, the densest island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: In the vicinity of Padang, the capital city of West Sumatra, an earthquake was recorded with 7.6 points.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 - point earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentaway, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Podjaj regency in the province of Aceg, causing destruction and panic related to the fact that people have not yet forgotten the devastating earthquake and the tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed under the wreckage of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Lombok tourist island in Indonesia, resulting in the death of more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed countless homes, and thousands of tourists could not leave the island immediately.
Sarah Paylin’s eldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges
Paylin's senior son, former Governor Alaska, and Vice President Sarah Paylin's candidate, were arrested for assault charges.
According to a report published on Saturday by the police in Alaska, 29-year-old Paylina of Vasily, Alaska, arrested for suspected domestic violence and charged him with obstructing reports of violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took her phone.
According to KTOU, Paylin is in custody at Matanuska-Susitna detention facility with the right to make a $500 deposit.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent" when he was asked if he confessed his guilt, reported online.
Peilin is charged with three class A offenses, presupposing an arrest within one year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also being charged with class B misconduct, which is punishable by a $2,000 prison sentence and fine.
For the first time against Paylin, criminal charges have been filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Payin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
At the moment, the Alaskan Veterans Court is on trial.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, as well as with obstructing reporting of domestic violence and carrying weapons of alcohol abuse when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said that he hit her on the face.
In 2016, Sarah Paylin was criticized by veteran groups for justifying her son’s harsh behavior with post - traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, an earthquake caused tsunamis, killing hundreds of people
At least 384 people died after the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - point earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The communications and power lines have gone out of range, and the number of victims can increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the center of Sulavesi Island, northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital city.
A video that spreads on social networks shows the moment when a disaster struck.
Hundreds gathered at a festival on the beach of Palu, when the tsunami struck the shore.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a terrorist suspect in New York City
In New York City, federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty of Saiful Saipov, a terrorist suspect in New York City, resulting in eight deaths -- a rare punishment that hasn't been applied in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Apparently, in October, a 30-year-old Saip driving a rent-a-car ride at the Home Depot pickup took a bike ride along the road in West Side, Lower Manhattan, and started smashing cyclists and pedestrians that happened on his way.
Corresponding to the report of the intention to execute in the South District of New York City to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saip 'intentionally' killed eight people and 'intentionally' caused serious bodily harm.
According to judicial material, each of these counts provides for the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Jury charged Sayip with 22 counts, in particular eight counts of murder for the purpose of a request, which is usually filed by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the accusers who described the crime committed by Saipe as "scarring, cruel and malicious," this attack is the result of "recent planning and preconceived intent."
The victims of the injuries, injuries, or killings by Saiful Habibullaevich Saip were Diego Enrique Andjelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Lora Dekadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnekko, as described in the communication of the intention.
Five were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time a criminal case has been committed in Southern New York City, which is punishable by death.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug suppliers, and was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
For the last time, the death penalty for federal affairs was imposed in New York in 1953, and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg's married couple were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov’s judicial records, the native of Uzbekistan did not demonstrate remorse in the coming days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he did not regret what he had done.
According to Saipov’s indictment, he informed the authorities that he had been inspired to conduct a video attack on his phone.
The police report that he also asked for an IDF flag in his hospital room.
He did not plead guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said they were "very disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept the confession of guilt and to sentence life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only strengthen the psychological trauma caused by these events to all the victims," Patton said.
Sayipov’s defense party had also asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Parliamentary MP from the Conservative Party believes that NAIJEL FARADJA needs to be held responsible for the negotiations on Brexit
Today, during a protest at the convention of the Conservative Party, Nigel Faradge promised to "mobilize the national army."
The former leader of the Party of Independence of the United Kingdom stated that politicians should "feel under" the pressure of Eurosceptics, as one of Parliament's deputies, Teresa May, had offered to hold negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservatory Party, Peter Bone, claimed on a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would have come out" if Mr. Faraj were Secretary Brexit.
Attention to May’s problems in trying to reconcile its deep ranks has added to the fact that members of the Conservative Party who are opposed to the exit have joined a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is trying hard to put into practice Chequers' compromise plan despite attacks by Brexit supporters, anti-existorants and the EU.
The Allies insist that she will not abandon her attempt to make a deal with Brussels, despite her negative reaction, and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what she is proposing and chaos.
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihall, Mr. Bone said he wanted to "refuse Chequers."
He invited Mr. Faraju to step out of the shadows and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for this, we would have left," he said.
Parliamentary MP Wellingboro added, "I will support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers."
Addressing the EU, he stated: "We fought in world wars not to be subordinated.
We want to pass our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, public opinion had changed: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and do not want to go out is totally not true."
A member of the Conservative Party and a supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to reporters, "I just say, "Prime Minister, listen to people.
Chequers' plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it's not supported by our party and our activists who are actually walking the streets and fighting for voters' votes.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening'."
In her address to Teresa May, she added, "Prime Ministers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraj said that politicians should "feel under pressure" if they are going to abandon the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them they're not gonna get away with it."
In his report to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want our political elite, who are planning to betray the idea of Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the national army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become independent, self-sufficient, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the opponents went through Birmingham and then held a two - hour rally in the center of town.
A number of activists waved banners of the Brixit conservators after the group started on this weekend.
The Labour Lord Adonis scoffed at the conservatives because after the opening of the conference, security problems arose as a result of their party program.
"These are the people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a complete farce.
There is nothing good about Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to "think seriously" about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections, she would "think seriously about running for president."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during the general congregations in West Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party from Massachusetts told of her future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for second term in November against a member of the Republican Party of Jeff Dill, who co-chaired Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is viewed as a major candidate that can fight Trump in 2020.
Her 36th meeting on Saturday was with voters in the form of general assemblies since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to take part in the presidential election.
Warren replied, "It's time for women to go to Washington and set up the government's work, and for that, there must be a woman on his forehead."
Arrested a suspect in the murder of a basketball player named LSU Tigers Sims.
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that there was an arrest on Friday of a suspect in the shooting of a basketball player named LSU Tigers Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Childon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. Eastern time.
On Friday, they posted a video recording of the shooting asking to help identify the person on it.
20-year-old Sims was shot at Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Vade Simms received a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result," journalist 247sports chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, Simpson was found to be at the scene of the crime, carrying arms, and shooting at Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Button County Police Department.
Sims, which was 6 feet tall and 6 inches tall, who was in the junior league, grew up in Baton Rouge, and he played 32 games with 10 stars last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes in the game, he scored 5.6 points and 2.9 picks.
Louis Hamilton reduced the backlog in the World Cup title after the team decided to give him the victory over Sebastian Fettel
Since Waltery Bottas had left Lewis Hamilton behind on Saturday, it has become clear that Mercedes’s command decisions will play a significant role in the race.
Bottas was well on his way out of the polls and almost passed Hemilton, who tried to hold his position on the first two turns and gave Fettel an opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fettel went to the pit stop first and left Hamilton on the track in the tail of the race, which had to solve everything.
The Mercedes team's pilot passed one more round and went behind the Fettel, but Hemilton broke into the leaders after a wheel-to-wheel maneuver, resulting in Ferrari's unwillingness to leave the interior space because of the risk that it would tighten up, after he managed to climb forward on the third turn as a result of a double maneuver.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back row of the net and stayed seventh to the end of the first round.
Then he led most of the race, because he didn't change the tire to quickly come to the finish and remove Kim Rikkonen from fourth place.
In summary, he stopped at a pit stop on his 44th lap, but couldn't increase the pace to the last eight, so Rikkonen moved fourth.
"This is a difficult day, because Waltery presented himself in full on all weekends and showed his nobility when he gave me the opportunity to pass.
The team did an exceptional job to take first place and second place," said Hamilton.
Body Language Was Not Impressive
At Saturday's rally, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Fainstein for her firm stand that she did not publish Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court of sexual violence.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, but instead voiced his opinion about what happened in the Senate, which, he said, demonstrated the human "substantiality, dirtyness and lying".
"The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that have happened in the last few days in the Senate, is anger, you see the evil people who show meanness, dirtyness and lying," he said.
"You look at publications and public information, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you been publishing information?
Remember her answer... did you publish the contents of the documents? – "What?
Oh, no.
I didn't make the announcement."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't advertise," he added, copying the senator's behavior.
In July, Fainstein received a letter detailing the charges filed by Ford against Kavanaugh, and at the beginning of September, his contents were announced, but Fainstein denied that the leak had occurred in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I didn't disclose the information I got from her," said the Finestein Committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I didn't break my promises."
However, her objection seemed to displease the president who commented on Saturday's rally: "I tell you, the language of her body was not impressive at all.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I've never seen anyone stay worse."
As he continued to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, who had been accused of sexual violence by three women, the president assumed that Democrats were using charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power in any necessary way.
You see meanness, uglyness, they don't care who they insult, who they have to cross in order to get power and control," Mediaite quotes the president as saying.
Elite League: "Dandy Stars" – "Belfast Giants", 5:3 p.m.
Player of the Giants, Patrick Duyer, has thrown two swords in a match against Dundee.
"Dandy Stars" was rehabilitated for Friday's elite league defeat at Belfast Giants, winning a 5-3 match on Saturday.
The Giants were given an early advantage in two pucks thanks to Patrick Duyer and Francis Boville.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney settled the bill in the home game, and then Duaire brought the Giants back.
Dandy player François Bushar balanced the score, and two goals by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen ensured their victory.
This is the third time in the elite league to defeat Adam Keep's team, who won the will over Dundee with a score of 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting of the season, and three previous matches won the Giants team.
The first duayre pecked for a fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFall’s transfer, and four minutes later, Bovolier, who received a platypus from David Rutherford, doubled the bill.
After a tense first period of fourteen minutes (13:10), Sullivan returned the masters of the field to the game, and at sixteen minutes (15:16) Couni, after receiving a platypus from Matt Markward, leveled the score.
Duyer preferred the Giants before the first break, leaving his second coat at the end of the first period.
The masters of the field regrouped, and Bushar for twenty-eighth minute (27:37) rebalanced the account, leaving the platypus when his team numbered.
Thanks to the efforts of Cooney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, he first brought Dundee forward and ensured the victory of his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Giants team, which has already lost four of the last five matches, is playing a exit match against Milton Kines.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid an earthquake
In Indonesia, the air traffic operator was declared a hero after he had helped to fly a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his life.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a severe tsunami earthquake on Sulavesi Island on Friday.
Subterranean shocks continue to rock the area, and many have been left in the city of Palu.
However, unlike their colleagues who had fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the dispatch tower, which had been heavily rocked, at Muthiar SIS Al-Jufri Airport in Palo.
He stayed in place to make sure that Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, was safely up in the air.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
Later, he died in the hospital.
A representative of the Indonesian Air Navigation Company, Johannes Sirate, stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian ABC News Agency.
We prepared a helicopter from Balipapapan to Kalimantan, to deliver it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pal.
"We're very sorry to hear about it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands, as the agency for mitigating the effects of the country's natural disasters claims that access to Dongala, Siggy and Butong cities is limited.
"The number of victims may increase because many bodies are still under rubble and many of them cannot be reached," said the representative of Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves that had reached six meters had devastated the city of Palu, where mass burials would take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes provide help and food.
Reza Kusuma, 35-year-old mom, said Sky News: "Every minute, quick help brings the bodies.
Clean water is not enough.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere."
The head of the International Red Cross Committee in Indonesia, Jan Helfand, told CNN, "The Red Cross of Indonesia has rushed to help the people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Ododo, arrived in Pal on Sunday and asked the military officials of the country, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
Early this year, Indonesia suffered from earthquakes on Lombok Island, resulting in the death of more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: A man disappeared after a plane crash in a lagoon, according to Air Niugini
The airline that was flying across the Pacific lagoon now claims that one person disappeared, although earlier reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated that it was impossible to find one passenger on Saturday.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a husband and cooperate with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when trying to land at Chuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men were taken to the hospital.
At the airline, six passengers were informed that they had stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the catastrophe and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
U.S. Air Force and Navy stated that the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jane said that the plane was flying very low above the ground.
"That's very good," said Jane.
Jane told us that he and others were able to get to the emergency exits on a sinking plane by being in a water belt.
He explained that the stewardess had panicked and shouted, and he had a slight trauma to his head.
In the U.S. Navy, sailors who worked nearby to modernize the dock also helped with rescue operations, bringing people to shore by means of an inflatable boat before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) deep into the water.
According to Air Safety Network data, 111 people have been killed in airline accidents in the last two decades associated with PNG airline registrations, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
An analyst restored the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution appealed against a man who was charged with burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Roulette, testified as an expert in operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to replicate the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and Jessica Chambers' 19-year-old victim on the night of the murder.
Roulett, reports The Clarion Ledger, reported that he had received data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night when she died that contradicted his earlier claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was next to Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last one.
On Saturday, Sanford gave a witness and claimed that he had not been in the city that day.
When the accusers asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night he was in a Sanford pickup truck, Sanford said he was "true because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Phone records indicated that they had known each other for only a week.
Roulett explained that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers’ phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Gail.
The defense has to make its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the jury to be transferred later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Trio hip-hop performers want to challenge the negative view of genre by filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed Group of Bristol states that hip hop has changed its nature – it has gone away from political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the leaks and make a conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and the Common have recently witnessed the revival of this direction in the United Kingdom thanks to groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another Dark One?!
In New York, the nanny sued for parole, receiving a racist message.
In New York, the nanny sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny they're racist, comparing the lawsuit to "exclaim."
Lancey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed concern when she saw that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, arrived on her first day of work in 2016, was black.
"Not another dark one," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in the report.
Instead of sending him to her husband, however, she sent him twice to Miss Morris.
She said that their previous nanny, who was an African American, was doing her job badly and that instead she was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Miss Morris was paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Now he's putting Morris in court, hoping to get compensation for the salary she'd get in six months of working with a couple she was hired to live in, even without a contract, to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them that you don't have to do that," she said on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the accusation that they were racist, the couple claimed that Morris’s release was a wise decision because they feared that they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said her husband, Joel Plasco.
"But would you leave your children with someone you treated rudely, even if it wasn't deliberate?
Your baby?
INJURY."
Comparing a lawsuit with a claim, Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a child only two months ago and "not yet finished".
"Would you take revenge on someone after that?
This is a bad act," added the investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social networks, criticizing their conduct and logic.
According to a new letter, the publishers of Padington feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear capable of speaking.
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, who was born almost after the book had been printed, said of the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the place of the first reader of the book before it was published.
Now it's funny, because we know about the great success that the story of Padington has achieved."
Telling her that her father, who worked as a BBC operator, before the little toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, was optimistic that his work had been rejected, she divided up how on the 60th anniversary of the book's release she felt "joy and sorrow" at the same time, because her father died a year ago.
Regarding Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
"He was a pretty modest man and didn't like bragging," she said.
"But Padington was as real to him as his own child!
I think he was looking at Padington's success exactly like that.
Although Padington is the creation of his imagination, he always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say good-bye on the phone
After landing, her daughter was sent to the 2nd Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
"On the regular phone, he said that everything was really bad that she shouldn't have done," said Mrs. Edin Laperez.
"And then over the phone called me and said that she would die for the next two minutes and I should say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Daddy, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
Doctors who gave her to keep beating her heart, gradually stopped acting, and left her body.
She died some time before everything was turned off.
I had to just sit back and wait, knowing what was going on at that time.
I couldn't grieve, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I should have really held myself in my arms."
Finally, Mrs. Edin-Laperuz, who was grieving for losing her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers, not paying attention to the severe trials she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had put my head down and could not hold back my tears.
This was difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to feel deeply for Hope.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have experienced grief leave their postcards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys leave their telephone numbers on the Wallia Bridge, where people can turn for support, as well as messages that please inspire them.
The son of Miss Davis Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same way every day," she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Leaden, told me that her son was a promising chef with an attractive smile.
"Everybody knew him for smiling.
They always said this smile made any room brighter."
But he quit his job before he died because he was "not in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother’s body after he committed suicide.
Miss Davis says, "I'm always afraid this will have consequences."
Miss Davis has created postcards so that people know that there are those they can turn to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't lock yourself in, you have to talk."
Miss Humphreys, who had been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, with whom she lived for 15 years shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed, that he was depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that he had changed."
And on Christmas Day, he was completely downhearted, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
She told them that his death had become a great injury to them, but they had to survive it: 'It caused a devastating one.'
It's a family thing.
But we have to keep living and fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on his hair: the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could get what we asked for -- limited in time and nature of the investigation -- we might have reached some agreement," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "breaking up" in the face of an unprecedented loss of allegiance to the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance has to do with time.
The mid-term elections will only take five weeks, November 6th, if the Republicans are expected to have problems, it will seriously complicate their attempts to conduct their own person through the election to the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush called senators to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked in the White House under the rule of Mr. Bush, and who helped him meet his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now sitting, there will be a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting to enable Vice President Mike Pens to resolve the problem with the same number of votes and to approve his election to the Supreme Court of Justice.
During Kima's reign, the number of North Korean refugees "shortened"
After Kim Chen-in came to power seven years ago, the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea declined, the South Korean legislator stated.
Park Pion Seug, referring to the data of the South Korea United Ministry, stated that last year the number of refugees was 1,127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were to strengthen border control between North Korea and China, and that smugglers who carry illegals now demand more money for it.
In Pyongyang, they abstained from public comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans eventually offer South Korean citizenship.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still formally at war, has improved markedly in recent months.
Early this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed the denuclearization issue, which had become a dead end.
This was following the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Ian in Singapore, where they agreed to cooperate in general terms on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yoon-ho accused the United States of lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no unilateral disarmament," Ri Jon-Ho said in his statement at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosy calls Brett Cavanaugh "the hysterical" and says he's not fit to work at the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Minority Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosy, named the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh's "sterical" and stated that he was not at the point of time suitable for working in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave her thoughts at an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I kept thinking that if a woman had ever acted in this way, she would have been called a 'sterical'," Pelosi commented on her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the sexual assault charges against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and at times he almost screamed and coughed, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "an absurd and co-ordinated destruction of the reputation", organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
In Pelosí’s view, Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, for this showed his prejudice toward democracies.
"I think that by these statements and his speech against Clinton and the Democrats he will himself withdraw his candidacy," she said.
Pelosi was indignant when she was asked if she would try to declare a Kavanaugh empire if his guilt was confirmed, and if the majority in the House of Representatives were to receive democracy.
"I will say this: if he does not speak the truth of Congress or the FBI, it is not only for the work of the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he works now," Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh now works as a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in Columbia.
Pelosy added that as a Democrat she was concerned about possible decisions by Kavanaugh against the law "On Available Medical Services" or "Roy v. Wade" cases, because he was considered a conservative judge.
At his hearings on the issue of the approval of Kavanaugh’s office, he went over the question of whether he would dismiss certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time when a judge becomes a hysterical, prejudiced person and we will say how wonderful it is," Pelosi said.
Women must possess these weapons.
These are just words that have accumulated months and years of rage, and she could not utter them without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's anything unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "One woman who was working somewhere with the executive director, and she helped me a lot, said that she was also crying when she got angry, but she had her own method, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to her roommate, "You can think I'm sad and that's why I'm crying.
And I am evil."
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was incredible."
Tears are considered to be an acceptable way out of anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my most vivid memories of the first job in the office, where most men worked, was the situation when I once cried with unspeakable anger, and the older woman was an unfriendly manager, whom I always feared a little, grabbed me by the collar and dragged me to the east cage.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to get to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from the Colorado Democrats, worked with Gary Garth in the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was caught on an out-of-marriage boat called Monkey Business, after which he stepped out of the race, a deeply disappointed Miss Schroeder decided there was no reason why she could not run for president.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and another candidate was the last thing they needed."
Someone called the situation "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind in the congregation, so she made a promise not to take part in the race unless she collected $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who had no regrets for men ’ support of $1,000, gave her only $250.
"Do they think they'll give me a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave a talk and announced that she would not hold a formal campaign, she was embroiled with emotion -- gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment with a system that made it very difficult to raise money and make voters not as much as members of the Chamber of Deputies, and anger at sexism -- she was ready to cry.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," said Miss Schroeder in the press.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about them writing on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
How the U.S. and China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the trade war between the United States and China were desperate, and although far from its completion, long-term divisions between countries can benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired his first warning shots earlier this year, taxing basic Chinese export goods, such as solar batteries, steel, and aluminum.
This week’s biggest situation was because of new freight tariffs totalling $200 billion (150 billion), which in fact taxed half of all goods coming from China in the United States.
Beijing has been paying back the same coin each time, with a recent bribe of between five and ten percent for American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has committed itself to taking similar measures in the United States, and the world's second largest economy will hardly be able to keep that promise in the near future.
Forcing Washington to retreat means accepting the demands, but for President China Si Jinping, the public worship of the United States is too shameful.
However, according to experts, if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, pressure from the U.S. trade war can bring China a long-term advantage by reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic downturn in any country, and it actually poses a greater threat than observers have recognized before," said analyst Abigail Grace, who deals with Asia-related issues at the Center for New American Security analytical centre.
Foreign Minister Says Syria "ready" to return refugees
Syria claims that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking assistance in restoring a war - ravaged country that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the real situation has become more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore terrorist - torn areas so that people can return to normal life.
Currently, all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave because of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and restricted their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian government would be pleased to receive assistance in restoring the war-torn country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that support rebellion.
Europe fortifies on Ryder's Cube in Paris
Europe's team won the Raider Cub in 2018 when it won the US team with a score of 16,5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated in Europe six times in a row and has not won the Club Ryder tournament since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team gained 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Michelson, who worked hard for most of the tournament, pierced his first long shot at the 16th hole of par-3 into the water and gave way to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of the four players who had ever been in the 5-0-0 account since the start of the 1979 tournament.
American Jordan Spit has been defeated with a score of 5:4 from the lowest ranking player in the European team, Turbierna Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the first stage in the world rating, gave up the 2-1 account of Jan Poulter of England, who may have been in the last "Raider's Cub" tournament.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the Ryder Cub, who has already participated in the tournament eight times, has become a European who has won the most tournaments during the entire time, bringing 25.5 points for his career.
"I don't normally cry, but I can't do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad to have the cup back.
This is the team's merit, and I am happy to be able to help," Garcia said, without holding his emotions back after winning in Europe.
He passes the estaphet to his fellow countryman John Remus, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday in a single game with a score of 2:1.
"I feel incredible pride for winning Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods has lost all four matches and now has a career record for the 13-21-3 Club Ryder tournament.
It's a wonderful statistic for one of the greatest players of all time to win 14 Major tournaments, only to give up Jack Niklaus.
During all weekends, the U.S. assembly tried to reach the fairway zone, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finnau, who showed high - class golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furik of the United States said about his team after a grueling performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we had little control over Europe.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the Association of Professional Players in the United States Golf and the Club Ryder Committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
They should not be commended.
We lost."
