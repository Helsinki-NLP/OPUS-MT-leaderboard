Eight-year-old chef found dead in a shop in San Francisco
The eight - year - old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was this week in the steps of the local store.
The victim’s brother, however, says that he has no idea who would want to hurt him, adding: “He’s finally starting to succeed. ”
The body found in Westfield Mall at Wednesday morning was identified as an eight-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, a court doctor's office.
Sanfrancia Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation is under way.
The brother of the victim Louis Galicia for the ABC KGO station in San Francisco said that Frank, who was formerly a regular chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
Sons & Daughters spokeswoman said his death was “shocked and destroyed. ”
"We have a small team that works as a closely connected family. We will miss him very much," the speaker said.
At this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first slept in the hostels, but that recently “he finally started to prosper. ”
"He found an apartment, dated a girl," said Louis Galicia for KGO.
Louis Galicia said he had no idea who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any argument.
He was a brother who took things as they were.
“Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an uncut diamond that irradiated every day”, he said.

Czech roads invested in the modernisation of vehicles over 31 billion.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the past six years, he has invested a state carrier in modernising vehicles over 31 billion crowns.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The costs of modernisation over the years, except for 2012, are however gradually decreasing.
In the last six years, Czech roads have invested over 31 billion crowns in the modernisation of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was reflected in the reduction of the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and six years for classic wagons.
A greater share of the investment was put by the carrier in regional transport, where about 60 percent of the money was directed, and 40 percent of the company invested in the renewal of long-distance vehicles.
The average age of locomotives and units is now 19 years.
However, modernised older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If the modernisation of vehicles were not calculated, the average age of moving vehicles of the ČD would increase by ten years.
A little older are on average personal cars whose average age at the start of modernisation is 23 years.
If only age from production date were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, in recent years, the classic sets consisting of wagons and hauled by locomotives from Czech and global railways are gradually disappearing and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotive from 280 to 223 pieces fell, similarly the number of classical wagons from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the carrier disposed of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of locking the opening during the ride.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these vehicles scrapped.
For example, from investments in the vehicle park planned to be made in the near future, it is possible to specify the purchase of 50 wagons for speed up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to install on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for the local fast track.
The contract consists of a total of up to 30 motor units and 20 electric units.
The authorities know about illegal advertising for four years, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely powerless, they admit.
For the fourth year the editor of the online journal Aktuálno.cz has been watching the story of billboard in South Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipna, where not only is there a touristic walk in the crowns of trees, but also the Olympic park.
The highway administrators know it's black, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds of similar ads all over the country, maybe thousands.
According to officials, there is a law to blame, which makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
A complex bureaucratic wheel is needed first.
Meanwhile, the company changes its name and the office is short on it.
Or just move the commercial a few meters and the official process has to start again.
Road and highway management admitted four years ago: the main move from České Budějovice to Lipno stands on our property near the state road advertising billboard on a black screen.
Not even three months were enough for officials to get rid of unauthorized portable constructions with a giant advertising poster.
It's like no one's got a problem standing right next to a car in a 50-meter security zone where no one can stand for safety.
Road administrators claim that they simply cannot deal with billboards because of the lax law.
Maybe put it on and take it away.
"We can't afford that," says spokeswoman Nina Ledvin, and refers to a complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of billboard must be prevented by law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began the online journal Aktualno.cz in detail in spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and authorities cannot effectively and quickly solve.
In South Bohemia alone, the editor counted dozens of similar mobile commercials placed against the rules right next to or near the vehicle.
There are other regions, too.
"We are having trouble getting the company to remove the attackers," confirmed the head of the Czech-Budship Regional Office, Jiří Klasa, whose colleagues have similar stories.
According to the Glass, there's a lax law to blame, which binds officials.
First of all, the owners of the billboard must reach out to put the commercial away.
But the bosses are often unattainable or they know a trick that has been described in the past, when the issue began to be more detailed: the mobile stand with advertising can move by a few meters and officials can throw the previous call to remove black advertising in the basket.
That's because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it looks at it as a new device and we have to contact the owners again," explains Jiří klasa.
The new law won't help.
A new law may have been introduced, which bans billboards by highways from September of next year and restricts them even by the first class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable advertisements will remain the same as before.
And the authorities won't be so relieved.
Firms can continue to earn tens of millions of crowns on illegal leases annually, and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard attracting Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the Czech-Budship Magistrate currently manages three administrative procedures for black built billboards.
The company is at risk of three hundred thousand fines in each procedure.
These are more advertisements that were placed in the Class I protection zone without permission.
Driving is not yet over, says Jaroslav Frost, head of the transport department of the Czech-Budship Magistrate.
The advertisement, which is currently interested in, is not yet configured among these cases, but will most likely come to them.
According to SSR spokesman Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will be reached on the regional table and then probably by the magistrates.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspected companies that can't contact.
He doesn't receive mail and the official headquarters in Žižkov cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company’s post office was attended by a South Bohemian businessman, Anton Fischer, who was known to have a heated dispute with the head of the Hyundai brand’s Czech representative.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard leases and offers them to advertisers, refused any connection in the past.
In the spring of this year, when the RSSD began to initiate an announcement on Lipno.cz, Fischer had officials send a letter to the secret company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where the new company is reportedly based.
Even from this address, however, no one has contacted the highway administrators to this day.
It's a waste of fighting.
Similar silence or opaque changes in seats are not uncommon.
One company we gradually fined two million crowns a few years ago.
But it changed the name and ICHO and there was nothing to solve.
The exterminator returned the case, the commercials continued, maybe elsewhere.
We are very powerless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, admitting under the condition of maintaining anonymity one of the officials.
The new law in this respect has not yet been resolved.
Currently.cz spoke with several Members, who raised the problem.
But they haven't developed any activity yet.
On the contrary, there were Members who wanted to extend the deadline for maintaining billboards in the main Czech communications.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only for national, but also for regional and municipal policies very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restrictions; on the other hand, they themselves need it for advertising in election campaigns.
I'm not slowing down the fairly established impression that if something doesn't work, it's necessary to change the laws.
Farmers harvest less grain this year, but more rape and poppy, they estimate statistics.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, the harvest of cereals this year will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Nevertheless, this year’s crop has been above average for the last five and ten years.
On the other hand, the beet harvest (by 3.9 percent) and poppy (2.5 percent) will be higher.
The harvesting of cereals this year will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Farmers will harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This results from an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on July 15th.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and assumed a tenth decline against last year.
Last year's crop of cereals was above average.
This year's crop has been above average for the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, it will be higher this year's harvest of rape and poppy.
The growers’ raccoons will clear by 3.9 percent more than a year ago when they received 1,256 million tons under the roof.
This year's poppy crops could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The expected decrease in the production of cereals is due both to a decrease in the acre yield by 3.7 per cent to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and to a decrease in the seed area.
Farmers live three percent less in the fields this year.
Wheat, which is the most important crop for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be 3.3 percent less this year.
The farmers moved her to more fields.
However, a lower hectare yield will be signed at the decline, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
About a fifth drop in statistics are expected in spring barley, which is most commonly used for beer production.
The decline in crop yields is a 15.2 per cent reduction in sediment areas, but also a lower acre yield.
On the contrary, barley in winter is born by 6.3 percent more.
The harvest of grain will also grow.
The crop of rape is estimated at 1.305 million tonnes, which is more against last year.
The settlement area expanded by 7.3 percent.
But the hectare yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year’s crop of rape exceeds a ten - year average of 13.3 percent, but it is found on a area of about a third more extensive than it was ten years ago.
In the last four years, the poppy field is also arriving.
This year, the farmers moved him to 35,543 hectares.
Against 2008, when poppy in the Czech Republic grew on record 70,000 hectares, it is only half of the field.
Thanks to the expansion of the seeds, this year's poppy harvest will be richer.
It goes up 2.5 percent to 27,423 tonnes.
But the hectare yield is going to be 6.1 percent lower.
The broken officers accused two men of assault with a knife and machete, the court sent them into custody.
The police charged two attackers who attacked a knife and a machete of a 35-year-old man on Tuesday in downtown Olomouc.
"Although the attacked tried to escape, they caused him septic and incisive injuries, which required treatment in the hospital and other treatments," said police spokesman Marie Strbáková.
Both apparent perpetrators were detained immediately after the attack by police officers.
The applicant submitted a motion to the court for their detention and the court complied with it on Friday.
Both men are facing three to ten years in prison.
The officers charged two detained men with assaulting a 35-year-old man in downtown Olomouc with a knife and machete.
The attackers caused him permanent and incision injuries, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people who happened on Tuesday at the right noon in the Freedom class, police reported.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, reported Olomouc police spokesman Marie Strbáková.
A mass struggle between the two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the Olomouc centre.
After an aggressive word crucifixion, two attackers attacked with the help of a knife and a machete of a 15 - year - old man.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, he was subjected to severe and incisive injuries that required treatment at the hospital and other treatments, the police spokeswoman said.
In an argument that aroused a lot of attention in the center of the city, which forced several police guards and guards to intervene on the scene, it was family disputes.
The criminals of a 40-year-old man from Slovakia and a 17-year-old man from Olomouc have accused him of trying to injure health and disorder.
The applicant submitted a motion to the court for their detention, and the court complied with him on Friday, the spokeswoman added.
Machete was used in the center of Olomouc during a mass battle by the attackers five years ago, which happened only a few dozen meters further, at the Varna discotheque in Riegrovo Street.
The officers then said that the group of about ten foreigners with weapons attacked the guests of the company who were standing outside the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished two attacking foreigners with a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you walk around them every day.
One of the most notorious examples of an unused and empty house is the vast building of the former residence of the IPB in the middle of Sensing Square.
It was supposed to work like a hotel a long time ago.
But it's still nothing.
That there is a need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what can be used by existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the centre of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Václavské náměstí there are a number of active houses, which, despite their location, size and often even memorial protection, are only empty and yawning.
We selected real estate in the center using the project Emptydomy.cz, which maps the long-term vacant property in the territory of the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of the financial problems of their owners, of opaque relationships between companies or of a state that does not or does not want to be rid of them.
There are more empty homes in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Whether the owners pay a special tax, they want an initiative.
They almost shot Fidel Castro, and Hitler's brother lived here.

Clinton's husbands made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to disclose his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, president Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars were paid to Clinton for charity.
Most of Clinton's income -- over six million dollars -- is for their speech.
Trump rejects his tax returns to publish.
US Democrats' candidate for Hillary Clinton's presidential office published her tax returns on Friday, increasing pressure on his Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, president Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, announced the AP.
Most of Clinton's income - over six million dollars - is for their speeches, mostly from before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that Clinton’s husbands had collected a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year and then a tax on income at the state and local levels of nine percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income at taxes.
Trump, however, has a similar problem, so far he has not made up his mind to publish his tax returns.
It is certain that Donald Trump does not pay any taxes, she wrote Clinton on Twitter a few minutes after she published her confession.
Clinton repeatedly returns to secrecy around Trump's incomes, inter alia, to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is really as rich as she claims, the AP said.
Trump's assets are estimated at billions of dollars.
A lower income would undermine the reputation of the Republican candidate as a successful entrepreneur.
Senator Tim Caine, who is running for Vice President in tandem with the former First Lady, today published a report on his tax havens over the last ten years.
Together with their wife, Anne Holton, they gave 7.5 percent of their charity earnings and paid 25.6 percent of their income at taxes last year.
Back in Nigeria, the armor broke again.
The Islamists of Boko Haram have defended consistent vaccinations and killed doctors.
In Nigeria, cases of child rearing have reappeared.
In the north-east of the country, the government has declared an emergency vaccination, as two children infected with this disease have been protected.
The vaccines were delivered by helicopters.
In the affected area, Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram, who defended vaccinations and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was undetected.
In the northeast of Nigeria, special vaccination of children against the armour will begin because two children infected with this disease have been raised there.
In Africa, armor was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that there will be millions of children in the state of Born and another four million in the surrounding states.
The Nigerian military helicopters quickly carried out child armor vaccines on Friday, according to the AP agency, to the affected northeast of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the virus has been undetected for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram in the past prevented vaccination and even killed doctors.
Their attacks on Thursday also made it impossible for doctors to get into areas where children with armor were found.
Both disabled battalions came with refugees from part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
WHO section director Michel Zaffran told BBC that the vaccination in Nigeria will start next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long been active in the state of Born.
The area was made available to international organisations and to the government at the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken significantly in this part of the country.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adevole admitted that the new cases of defense were a great disappointment for the country because Nigeria wanted to report next year that the defense had been eradicated.
The WHO noted that it is possible that although the disease did not occur for two years, it spread among children.
Children under the age of five are now expected.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all defence cases in the world.
While in 1988 there was a turnaround in 125 countries, it now survives in just three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the moving stories of fallen women.
Pope František met with 20 former prostitutes who escaped from a gang of pimps thanks to the police.
The Pope listened to their hard stories and called them to look with confidence into the future.
František wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for a stronger fight against it.
Pope František met twenty former prostitutes in Rome who were liberated by the police from the power of a gang of pimps.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the moved stories of fallen women and then urged them to look with confidence into the future, the Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes that Frantisek visited were six Romanian women, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All were subjected to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution according to the Vatican.
He wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for a stronger fight against it, said the pope's spokesman.
František often draws attention to the fates of people on the edge of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this April and June thanks to his personal invitation.
France is going to hit the jihadists.
Without the help of Muslims, that's not gonna happen.
In the fight against radical Islam, France is to help Muslims themselves.
In addition, Prime Minister Manuel Valles is preparing major changes in the functioning of mosques and spiritual education.
We've closed 20 mosques and prayers since last December.
And others will follow, announced by the Home Secretary.
In the country, over a hundred jihadists work.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this recognition of freedom," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
In particular, it is intended to ensure that only the imams who were educated in France preach in mosques and prayers.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from a foreign country to build new mosques, most of them from Morocco, Algeria, and the Gulf of Persia.
For this reason, too, preachers are allowed to spread radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the prime minister added.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should work like a bridge between a secular state and a Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
In the country, the French Islamic Foundation, founded by the then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005, is now operating.
The Foundation had already contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that financed their construction.
But institutions soon hit internal strife and rivalry.
"It is a total failure," said Valls recently.
After the attack on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the French political scene sparked a debate about a new institution that will replace the functional foundation.
Other terrorist attacks in France have all accelerated, in the name of the Islamic State, by radicalised Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve was recently told that a new foundation will be established in October this year.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure funding of mosques from domestic resources and also to monitor the properties.
For the time being, it is not clear where it will take money not only to build new mosques, but also to various educational centers.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on Halal food.
In practice, the vendors would be paying for food and certification.
Some of this money would then travel to the foundation's cash register.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French travelers who go to Mexico.
Each year, about 30,000 of them go to Saudi Arabia for their traditional pilgrimage.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, in the mosques in the future, only preachers who passed special education programmes at French universities should act.
This should ensure that the preaching is in harmony with democracy.
We'll close the radical mosques.
The French government is currently being pulled against the radicals.
And others will follow, announced recently by the Minister of Interior.
In France there is no place for those who report hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
In the country, according to estimates, there are about 2,500 mosques and prayers.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islam.
Since 2012, the authorities have cleared about 80 names, and for several other tens they have considered it.
Not everyone thinks that the steps of the government can act strongly against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize themselves will do the same.
This is not the case in mosques, young people are radicalizing on the Internet, said Severine Labatová, an expert at the National Centre for Scientific Research.
Drago Kelemen lost in the 1st round of sprint with star Baugem.
For the procedure to the eight-final, the Czech track cyclist must be killed in repairs.
Dražní cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after the skill of the sprint between the best eighteen in the 1st round lost a fight with the French great Grégory Baugé, the defender of silver from past games in London.
They have to kill for the process to an eight-final.
At the start of the royal discipline on the road, 27 riders stood up, and the best Czech driver at the moment had written down the 14th best time.
The two-pointer with the flight start was 9.969 seconds away.
At the main elimination stage, he was waiting for him in the qualifications of the fifth Baugé, who already has bronze from Rio in the team sprint.
Although Kelemen was finally reaching out to an experienced Frenchman, he followed the course.
A brilliant performance flashed on the defense attorney Jason Kenny.
Eighty-two-year-old Brit went to the third fastest two-stage history, and the qualification won in the Olympic record 9,551.
It was easy to expect that he also dealt with the last person who was a German Maximilian Levy.
There was also a British quartet in line with Bradley Wiggins, who in a four-mile race hit the new world record 3:50,570 and went to the finals.
The current maximum (3:51,659), which the British owned for four years since the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young Doctors Press: Want a fresh wind in the field
Representatives of young doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute over a new contract.
The Council of Young Physicians (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask for full advice on supporting other field events in early September.
JDC says that the ministers failed to resolve their contract issues.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted against the agreement agreed with BMA.
58 % of its members who participated in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members published on Thursday night on Twitter, JDC President Ellen McCourt said that the government remained "still silent" on issues, which is a big deal to reject the contract.
She said: “In this light, the executive branch of JDC decided by vote to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to request a new formal hearing on all matters.”
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Executive Board formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve a running programme for the proscribed sector events in early September.
The dispute led young doctors this year to announce up to six strikes, including the first general strikes in the history of NHS.
The leader of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malawian, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
BMA members at pre-vote meetings before 54,000 young doctors and medical students said the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said that the contract would mean a burden for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: Union "inconclusive"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the formal end of eight months of the long verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimír Putin welcomed the Turkish counter-party at the luxury palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more after this reconciliation.
There's been a handout, yes.
But Putin didn't smile and barely radiate heat from him, even according to his measured standards.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his “Dear Friend” to Mr Putin - five times, as one of the reports states.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its pre-crisis level, but will be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers said that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm has revealed the opposite.
But the lingering cold that came out of Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the shooting of the Russian warplane by Turkey at the Syrian borders.
Moscow's reaction was furious back then.
Putin was handing out bullets around him, and Ankara accused Moscow of throwing a knife in the back.
The deterioration was greater than the loss of a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
State-controlled media for months led a massive full campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly it looked like the Turks could do anything.
More serious was the accusation by the top state officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from the illegal trade in oil in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But there's an official message in St. Petersburg that it's time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he had requested from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some kind of victory as well.
For Ankara, the benefits of the truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan was almost power-free during the failed coup last month, and that is why he needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have apparently also shaken them.
There is also an economic motive.
The Russian sanctions had a severe impact - especially the cancellation of charter flights, which carry several million Russian tourists on the coast of Turkey each year.
This number has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly breathe when flights are renewed, as appropriate.
They make money on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, the state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when the Turkish agricultural commodities were re-imported.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the news reports say.
The visit, however, had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry in the West for what it considers to be a weak reaction to the attempted coup.
In addition, the long-standing hostility of lengthy EU entry talks and Putin's entry - which is eager for the cooling to use and break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly got the bonus points when Ankara asked him to help the elected authorities after an attempt at a coup.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has deep-rooted fear of regime change, this is given.
So the summit in this pumping, coastal palace of Russia and Turkey enabled me to demonstrate what one analyst described as “uncollecting incompatible” to me: how the forces of the two countries that feel rejected and used by the West combine.
Despite the fact that they have publicly shown mutual reconciliation, however, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow has recently taken up the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are on the opposite sides.
It could be said that, after almost three hours of opening talks, both presidents at the press conference indicated that they had not even mentioned the issue.
Turkey's president deliberately addressed the question of the differences between them, while Putin decided to raise these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both states could find common ground on the Syrian issue.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of total disaster, when a NATO member of Turkey shot down a Russian fighter - it is certainly better that the two leaders speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of the bank, the RBS brand is to be pushed back to the role of the office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
Of these, she was half - dead when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from her debt.
At that time, strategists used ‘RBS’ to protect other brands of consumer finances.
There were millions of liberals to sponsor international sport, from the rugby championship of Six Nations to the champion of Winbledom Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more prominence to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not start new business.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of central and stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank mark is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for private banking that will get more ahead - Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During his journey to customers and employees in Inverness-shire McEwan answered our questions Ross McEwan.
The BBC station Scotland said: “The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and the brand for which our employees work, because we are now much more becoming a brand bank.”
Since the bank itself became a global brand, it also became a global brand for RBS.
Now I'm saying that we don't have global aspirations anymore, we're working on the home scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that she will not continue sponsoring the Six Nations Championship, preparing a profile of individual brands of sport sponsoring.
"It is a good time for us to move to the brand bank, because the basic question (which we are asking) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?" the Executive Director stated.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say that we'd become a great bank for customers and they'd introduce those brands.
But along with how we focused on customer needs and not on our own, I think there are a lot of changes.
We can remind you of these stamps, I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket riding Predilection led to the goal of the 3000th winner.
Dettori sprays champagne after a double victory in Newmarket brought him 3,000 victories
Jockey Frankie Dettori won the 3,000th victory in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone reached its second victory on its local track - on the horse of Prediction, trained by John Gosden.
Five-four-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to have achieved such a result in equal terms.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The threefold champion of Dettori, who had previously won the Ghayyar horse, said: “It’s strange. ”
I'm very moved because my family is here too.
I am extremely glad that this happened in Newmarket, because I just docked here 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not the Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved, and I'm very grateful.
Dettorius collects congratulations when after victory brings Predilection
Two jockeys of this milestone reached in the obstacle prizes - the Richard Johnson Jockey Champion and the 20-fold Retirement Champion, Sir Anthony McCoy, who, during his career breaking records, led to the goal of more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times, and it is no surprise that he reached a milestone that only a few riders have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but that's exactly his tactical fistron, which distinguishes him from the other riders in the real world.
He's the fantastic ambassador of the race, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for many years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he didn't just go on weekends and big races, he'd have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is that Frankie was driving a winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He has a living character, which is good for British racing sport, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous summer jump
From summer finishes to summer jumps - Frankie Dettori was a messenger of British straight races for two decades.
It was like riding a mountain road.
An insufferable number of big race winners, including his famous “great seven” in Ascot. He also survived the plane crash and was banned from drugs.
Three years ago, he staggered for the first time when he returned after a six-month ban, but he showed incredible inner strength and all the doubters came back in the best form.
And maybe it won't be the last time - Dettori has already declared that he would like to continue racing for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin sacked President Sergei Ivanov's chief of office
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov from office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest associates for many years.
Three-thirty-year-old Ivanov was appointed special representative for ecology and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin states that Putin “released Ivanov from his service the head of the Russian presidential office,” but no reason was given.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivan's deputy since 2012.
Four-four-year-old Vajno was formerly a diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, promoted at the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
On the website (in Russian), he later served as head of the Presidential Protocol and the Presidential Office.
When appointing Putin, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of administration is to support your Head of State's activities in terms of drafting laws and checking the extent to which your instructions are respected.
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to release him from his post and recommended that he replace him with Vaina.
Will they convince the smiles?
This step completely Mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates for a long time, and he worked for the KGB as well as Putin.
As head of the President's office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast by state television, both men said he was leaving the office on his own.
But the smiles on the cameras convinced few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of some kind of struggle for power?
Nobody knows yet.
But the official statement that a man who was once considered a possible president is suddenly seeking to lead Russia's environmental policy has met with great mistrust.
On the Kremlin’s website, the comments to Putin stated: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you to give me this very challenging post, even a problematic post, for four years.
Apparently, I was the head of the President's office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up his post in December 2011.
He has previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and formerly, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was in charge of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of his five closest associates.
In time, it was even speculated that Ivanov could become a successor to Putin in charge of the state after his second election period, since the third period would be against Putin.
This post, however, was taken over by another close associate of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Only three and a half years later, Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the Presidential Office.
Thomas Gibson, star of the Criminal Thoughts series, was released after the director hit him.
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The ABC and CBS television stations that produce the series announced its release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday prior to his release.
There have been creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I am sorry that this happened," he said in a statement.
According to ABC and CBS TV stations, the details of how Gibson's character disappears from the TV show that watches the stories of the FBI's team of agents, a little later.
The four - year - old actor who was celebrated by the main role in the Dharma and Greg series has been active since the first series in 2005.
"I love the minds of criminals, and in the last 12 years I have put my heart and soul into them," Gibson said in his statement, which he issued on Friday.
I was hoping I'd be there until the end, but now it won't be possible.
I'd like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show could ever hope for.
Return of the show to the 12th series is expected September 28th.
In Banff, mysteriously landed in the garden of fish
A man from Banff town asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish may be the sandeel that left the water spruce there.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a short film of his find on Periscope’s channel in the belief that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeter of fish in his garden got in.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connects with Fife
The project for £1.35 billion is due to be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge is now connecting with Fife.
So this is the first of the four “plyholes ” that are now almost completed around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
There are 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 suspended ropes.
The project for £1.35 billion is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is the historic moment and symbolic moment of building Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, all of us have witnessed how the construction engineers used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive dimensions and mass of the bridge, the closure between the viaduct and the surface of the bridge was a delicate operation which required extraordinary accuracy.
There is now a total of more than 79 % of the total surface of the bridge, the concrete for the last part of the platform now pours out in Rosyth, so the whole platform is ready to lift up onto the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first closure of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the peak of earthly construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the expanding North Tower platform, we had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by extending the north approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and very delicate operation at the same time.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, it weighs about 6,000 tonnes and it had to be pulled up by about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances with which the team worked were very small - just a few millimeters each way.
Everything was going very well.
Rescue in Moelfra Bay: Three men are “happy to be alive”
Three men are “happy to be alive ” after being flushed by water from their fishing boat at Anglesey.
Rescue boats station Moelfra RNLI issued an alarm Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the crew had seen the incident in the Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued unregulatedly.
“We saw their boat circling near them and thought of the worst,” said Moelfra Vince Jones, a driver of the rescue boat.
"The strong wind fortunately drove him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men rescued a local fishing boat, a third man at the age of 60 was found without a life jacket worn out, holding on to fights.
They were all transferred aboard the Coastal Rescue Boat and carried back to the rescue boats station.
Jones said: “The three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The ship's engine had a rope for an emergency shutdown, but somehow there was a disconnect from the person who was driving the boat when there was a rollover.
Someone up there was holding a protective hand.
The judge refuses to deal with the case because of Bluchor's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of the three Members who, according to the indictment, were to receive from Prime Minister Nečas and his then chief of cabinet Jana Nagy's political affairs, a lucrative post for political concession.
In 2012 the tax package was approved.
Shchahrer, Fuksa and Tluchor gave him their resignations.
Then they showed up at influential positions in state companies.
So they also faced the suspicion of a bribe and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, it was not justified, and they were thus compensated for a total of almost 2 million crowns.
The silencer now acts as a witness in the cause, following the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a court building on the Fruit Market and settles civil disputes.
Nevertheless, she wants to be cautious with the judge, Helena Králova, and to prevent possible objections.
The case is likely to be taken over by another Prague court.
The king has already absolved Jan Nemora of guilt twice before Nagy.
It was an alleged misappropriation of military intelligence to monitor the first wife of prime minister Nevreka Radka.
In this case, the Bat didn't set up.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessary overreaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted in such a way that the court can be ruled out if the Witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to judge then, he wrote for the diary.
"I think it's tingly," he added.
Roman Boček, a former official, is also charged with political affairs.
According to his lawyer, Peter Toman, a possible objection would have a chance of success.
The Prague 1 District Court discussed the charges of the former chief of cabinet of Prime Minister Peter Nečas Jana Nagyová (now Time) and other accused of misappropriation of the Military Intelligence Department on 13 June.
There's an Untime with a husband coming to court.
The M.E. was supposed to deal with Peroutka's statements.
For example, the wife of the delegation was to judge President Milos Zeman's statements about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutko.
Zeman said he was sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl apparently died in an allied air raid.
She and her two old girlfriends flew to Syria last February from Gatwick airport in London.
The British Ministry of Interior did not comment on her death.
According to police, young London women who fled their homes were smuggled to Syria across the Turkish border.
Shamima Begumová, Amira Abbase and Kadiza Sultanaova headed according to the media for their next former classmate from the London School of Bethnal Green Academy.
Last year's case sparked a huge wave of attention as well as tension between Britain and Turkey.
Britain’s security forces estimate that some 600 British Muslims, some 50 young women and girls, have gone to Syria.
A number of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home represent a terrorist threat for Britain.
The work of dreams for a hundred thousand dollars.
Well paid jobs you don't even need a college for.
That's what it looks like to be an A.T.A. job.
And often for the other.
The advantage is not only to the Czech ratios of extremely high salary (in Prague you will earn up to CZK 180,000) but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge shortage of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
According to estimates, nearly 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
The most wanted are according to the statistics of Grafton staff agency programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
So they are not competing for a job, but a job position for candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
High school is not a necessity.
High school education is not a necessity.
Higher education is a good basis and is a general indicator of the intelligence and education of the candidate, but often does not have much to do with the knowledge of development.
The developers have to constantly learn new things, which once educated college will not replace, says Petr Kubačka, Director of Monster Career CZ.
Most of all, it's made in Prague.
Aitarian wages are high above the republican average.
For the most money they will come to Prague and Brno, in the regions it is no longer such hitparade.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those of Prague," says Kubačka.
For the highest wage, tech executives will reach it.
In Prague and Brno can come to CZK 120,000 - 180 000.
In other regions, wages are lower, but they do not fall below CZK 80,000.
IT is also requested by project managers.
On arrival, they can earn CZK 60,000 - 100,000.
It's also about graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the office of work, they do not pay for it.
Because if companies fold and transfer experts from another company, they like to touch on a graduate student.
They can raise him according to their own.
They won't work without a tongue.
Knowledge of a foreign language is appropriate in every profession, but at least decent English is necessary for the AIs.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity for some IT.
On the other hand, we are faced with a number of cases where companies are looking especially for a highly educated and experienced person and only satisfy the average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, the aid worker manages more foreign language, he is interesting to his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, the Director of Cuba adds.
Yoo in Google, there's paradise.
Only quietly envy can the Czech employees in Google.
Of course, there is a flexible working time for them, the possibility of working from home or various short - term relationships, not just for mothers.
"The new daddies are provided with a four-week vacation after the birth of a baby," says Martina Joneková, Google spokesman.
Hiccup also provides health care for employees and family, eating, transport, training, wellness or massage directly at the workplace.
Anyone who wants to learn has a green one, and it doesn't matter what new one wants to learn.
But that doesn't end the benefits.
Such a full free refrigerator is also definitely not to be thrown away.
A healthy lunch (in some locations and breakfast and dinner) is available on the spot every day.
In addition, in all offices there are so-called micro-cookies, where people always find healthy snacks, the speaker reveals.
And in order not to throw anything away, so what they don't eat, they put it in boxes that employees can take home at night.
And the reason for these for the Czech ratios of incredible advantages?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"For Google it is not important that employees sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions," the speaker adds.
The UN has sharply criticised Bulgaria for criminalising refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights for the criminalization of refugees.
Bulgaria's official strategy "causes serious concern that Bulgaria does not respect international law", Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in his statement.
He noted that "he is particularly concerned to witness how important and influential public figures are expressing public support for criminal armed fighters, who are also holding chases to refugees at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people crossing into the Bulgarian territory are automatically arrested," Zeid stressed.
And what's even worse - they're often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to get out of the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including his own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants last year for the same period of 21,000.
Pokémon Go - the pursuit of health and happiness to be paid
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
A number of people over the past decade have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon picks people up from couches and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens initially collapsed on TV, later on video games and the latest on smart phones.
It's great to see that technologies and activities outside don't rule out each other.
I am talking, of course, about the fashion that Pokémon Go is, an application based on sets that first appeared in video games at the end of the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
Like many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest before the introduction of this new game at the beginning of July in the USA, Australia and New Zealand.
The introduction in other countries was then postponed due to the huge interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon Go won in a few days more users than Tinder and almost as many users as my Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smart phone go out looking for Pokémons that watch with GPS, and when they find them, they can "photo" them (through screen on the phone) or "catch".
Mania has won a generation that played a game in the younger ages, lifts it out of the seats and leads out to look for Pokémons.
In the United States, this game has resulted in a marked increase in the number of steps a “average” person will take every day.
The Cardiogram application for smart clocks from Apple, which monitors 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of starting the game the number of people monitored every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who Pokemon Go is playing - only sees rough data about the levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns seeking to “find 30, ”“ get out of the couch, ” and “be active every day” have fallen to barren soil, as most public health messages are boring and targeted at people who do not look well.
Nevertheless, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that we cannot fully list here.
But the beauty of Pokemon Go game lies in that people go out and do something that they enjoy.
So you cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight, and fun.
Some even make new friends in the pommon hunt.
As it is, there are, of course, such boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can get in the door.
What's that?
There's been a breakthrough.
In their time of application for smart phones, like Fitbit, they were able to track our activity, but they didn't give us a reason to do something like this.
The new one is glancing and the interest in it begins to drop at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that combine applications and virtual reality with activities in the real world and will help a number of people in pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Billes won gold in multiple gymnastics of women
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Billes is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jump.
No pressure on the logs.
They were all in the middle of nowhere.
Excellent in everything.
And now finally the Olympic champion.
Nineteen-year-old American gymnast went straight on Thursday to win the title in a multi-fight, and the others on full-line under the Olympic spotlights were overtaken.
The total result 62,198 clearly confirmed its headshot in front of the silver medalist and team member Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliyou Mustafa.
Simone Bilesová (USA) on Thursday during a performance in the finals of the multiplay of individuals in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win the match, and the fifth in total, when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best of all.
When her overall final score was on the board and her long journey to this point ended, tears appeared on her face.
This success ranks her in the same league of unique athletes of his time, such as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles predominates her sport for the last three years, won 15 medals in the world championships - including 10 golds. Her fascinating compositions are a mixture of ambition and accuracy and the 1984 Olympic Champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast she has ever seen."
The last test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the race, but too much expectations between her and the burden.
Anything other than returning home to your family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals, would be perceived as a disappointment.
Simone Bilesová (USA), left, and Aly Raismanová hugged after winning the gold and silver medal in the final women's multiplay singles at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The first Biles won Tuesday, when she was as a screamer in the celebration of the outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolii.
Billes insists that during her long journey to the top, she never looked forward, which is not entirely true.
Part of its composition in simple - the one that contains a typical triple salad with a double twist - is set up in Latin music that would be suitable for home to streets outside the Rio Olympic arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a battalion and her talent was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman on her way to the gym where Boorman trained and gained strength.
The competition has not lost since the summer of 2013 – that is a sequence of victories that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafa took a short lead with two twists, it was just an illusion.
Kladina and simple - where Billes defends the world championship - waiting.
She got back to her forehead with 15,433 points for the pool - and ended up with 15,933 points in straight.
Raisman hugged her gently when they waited for the final score - just a formality - and around glittering red, white and blue shadows came tears when the wish that she once had written in her diary came true.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payoff for the Olympics four years ago, when she was sharing the third track with Mustafan, but then the bronze for the sum of three of the best compositions.
This time, the twenty-two-year-old captain of the team that the Americans call "grandmother" was quite ahead of her.
After her simplest, she sent a crowd of air kisses, overcome by a return that sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Billes, this 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where she became a complete hit, a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial killer case shot listening to music in the car
According to a police report published Thursday, two women died and a girl at the age of 12 during the most important attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot sitting in a car, talking and listening to music.
The authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis’ daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th in a car parked on the way in.
The report states that an armed man was standing on the side of a passenger and fired eight shots from his handgun. Then he fled in another vehicle.
According to the police, it's not a triple homicide robbery, because the attacker didn't take his wallets or the $2,900 that one of the adult victims had on him.
P.D. in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said that investigators are investigating whether the shooting had any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
In two mostly Spanish neighborhoods there were nine attacks in four months, killing seven people and killing two others.
“It’s happening in the villa in front of the houses,” said Howard earlier this month for the KPHO station CBS.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including brown Nissan from the late 1990s, black BMW from the late 1990s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was transferred to the hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner (31) and Ellis Maleah's daughter died on the spot.
The witness told the police that it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, whose target was empty delivery only half an hour before the triple murder. Police believe that its originator was this serial killer.
The investigators found the shells and from the remains of the bullets in the seat and from beneath the hood of the engine assembled the bullet.
Mother of a six - year - old child with microcephaly: “His condition is improving”
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike their peers, they suffer from microcephaly, which is a result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I thought I couldn't handle it.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not at all true - of course you are ready for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, learned that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a facility.
“My first reaction was that I thought people were not doing this anymore today,” explained Picciut.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Until he was three years old, he couldn't sit down, he couldn't crawl, and he's still not talking.
Some milestones are already being filled.
He goes with help and rides a bike.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth shows the sign language used by Edmund to say, “Please, sing to me. ”
“We teach him sign language,” said Picciutová for CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - it says Edmund invented some of the characters himself.
Microcephalies can come from a range of different states: genetics, such as Edmund, and infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as bedrooms or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may differ significantly.
It's too soon to tell us what the Zik virus will have to do with the lives of the infected.
Picciut reminds us of the emotional tax that an uncertain future takes on.
I keep asking, "What's going to happen next?"
What's next?
And he's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the overall prognosis was, because I don't expect anyone to be able to tell me.
But Picciut has an encouraging report for mothers of all children who suffer from congenital defects caused by Zika virus.
Things are getting better.
Just know it'll be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods required rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and massive floods in Louisiana made the governor declare an emergency on Friday. On Saturday, another rain was expected.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) reported that after extreme castings many rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and in southern Mississippi are pouring out of their shores and threatening major floods.
Governor Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that officials are constantly in contact with local authorities and the assistance is already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, the governor's spokesman for national security and crisis preparedness, said they were getting applications for vehicles for water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said Tangipaho's only district asked for 10,000 bags of sand.
The flood patrols will remain in most of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service stated in the statement that more than 8 to 13 centimeters may rain over the sea.
In southern Alabama there was a flood patrol in the emergency on Friday, when the rain continued around the city of Mobile.
According to predictions, the Comite Rivers at Baton Rouge and Amit at Denham Springs will culminate on weekends.
Meteorologist Alec Krautmann said that both said they could flood a number of houses in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He further said that the danger is floods in the Ascension district, when these watercourses will only drift slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the state border of Mississippi in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest recorded level on Friday at 9 a.m. local time.
Rescue officers are still picking up people from the tidewaters in Amite and Wilkinson County, southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and step-son were already among the saved at Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said his next stepfather, who lives nearby, warned him.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
We had her all the way down to the waist.
According to his wife, this is the highest level she has ever experienced on a river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all his family are disabled and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that crisis workers rescued all three huge cargo cars in military style and moved them to a fire station in Gloster, where they remained hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuation of valuable rains, the floods are "swimming rapidly" and the authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone announced that between midnight and Friday morning, an estimated 35 centimeters [35 cm] of rainfall fell.
Krautmann said the ground has been heavily saturated since Wednesday.
The authorities stated that the great rain and paid journeys required the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahou district and the abolition of the teaching in five school districts.
According to an old man from Tangipaho, the WWL station announced that 200 homes were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
The mayor of Robby Miller said that the authorities rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals who had been imprisoned by the high water.
In Amit and Hammond, shelters were set up for those evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water starts to rain," he said.
More than 20 streets were closed in Tangipagoa District in Hammond, and locals received sandbags that could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
“The last major floods were here in March,” said Lacy Landrum, the city manager.
These floods seem to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, manager of the crisis situation in Harrison County, Mississippi, said that there is continuing rain on the coast of the Gulf of Persia.
He said that on Thursday, a few houses were notified, but on Friday, none of them appeared on the report.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amit, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places I've never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "the boy shot as shot up", survived shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, and this week it is already the second shooting of a 6-year-old child in town.
Child's grandparents identified her as Mahai Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents say that the boy suffered a number of gunshot wounds, including weakness, legs, arms and abdomen, but was conscious when transporting him to the hospital.
"He took the very power, his small body was shot at as it was being handled," said his grandmother, Delores Melendez.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family for the station said the boy should be cured.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of primary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three more men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men aged 29 is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia there are two other victims in stable condition.
According to the station, a child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 90-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be the shooter.
CBS researchers Philadelphia reported that there was likely a shootout between several armed men.
There were shells found on the site from weapons of attack, belonging to various weapons of attack.
It was certainly a continuing battle, apparently.
There were shells on both sides of the sidewalk on the street.
It therefore seems that there were several armed fighters who were actively involved," the captain of the Philadelphia Police, Anthony Ginaldi, said at the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No one's been arrested, and the police are reportedly investigating video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray shot Tuesday in front of a house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby, and Laurie
This is how I picture a women's gymnast team for this year's Olympic Games, for a few reasons.
First of all, I've been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And second, there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, who inspired so many young color girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and the Catholic Madison Kocianová.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also fixed the presence of blacks and Latin Americans on the tip of the sport.
The gymnast number one in the last four years was an African-American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second pier last year.
It means something.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals suddenly became the champion of the Olympic Games, and America lashed out.
Now the world could have witnessed the incredible performance of the three-time world winner, Simone Billes, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed unexpected but master gymnastics.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the women's multiple fights.
And Aly Raisman's team member won the silver.
We're witnesses to the sports peak, but in gymnastics classes in the country, it doesn't look that way.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie graduated from the Olympic team in the same way as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five", because the team of gymnasts at the next Olympic game will be composed of only four athletes, and this is the last year that Martha Karolii train.
The reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts practice mostly in private gymnastics clubs, which maintain parents who pay the costs of training, equipment, roads, jerseys, competitive fees, hotel accommodation (for trainers and their confidants and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich suburban areas which can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training and for the families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Billes, and Maggie Honey, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started in gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring training in gymnastics, which are more accessible and accessible to communities of countless young girls, whom Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspired.
I founded the gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free gymnastics or low costs in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (primarily black and Hispanic origin) and we trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifelong benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
The inspiration of this team will send us thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing you the “girlpower” and winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origins to embark on the road to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter the next strikes.
The ministers hoped that the British Medical Association (BMA) would end the differences with regard to the changes after the revised contract was concluded, but 58 percent of the 37 000 young doctors attending the election refused the contract.
Hunt discovered plans in July to force the agreement that the NHS was in “no one’s land” and that further delay would have a detrimental effect on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes in night and weekend work procedures to improve care in nonsocial hours.
Doctor Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Commission for Young Physicians, stated in her statement last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current labour crisis and thus a fair treatment of all doctors."
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors enter into a new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have been met with reluctance to engage Dr. and often with deafening silence by the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push on coercion and resolve the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed, as nurses and specialists were called to replace doctors who were among protestors.
The ministers hoped that the British Medical Association (BMA) would conclude disagreements with regard to the changes following the conclusion of the revised contract.
BMA wants higher salary for work on the weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of the NHS employers, called on young doctors not to enter any strikes.
Mortimer said: “The exercise will be limited or nothing, but there will be pressure on already overcrowded teams and services and increased anxiety, exhaustion and disruption for patients, nursing staff and their families. ”
In the past two months, we have dealt with the advice of young doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health, we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervisor and informant.
The employers hoped that the continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as burdens, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after career interruption, training costs, mutual recognition of courses, study freedom and wage differentials between sexes - was evidence of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were taking agreements that were reached with BMA in November, February and May.
The cure for 60 crowns per day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of a heart attack will be able to take a medicine that recalculates about 60 crowns (two pounds). The authorities recommend that it be administered more to patients for a longer time.
Ticagrelor’s blood clotting medicine reduces the risk of seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now given for 12 months after the treatment of the heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizures.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the medicine be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, NHS watchdog NIS recommends that it be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people will experience a heart attack or a stroke every year.
The heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which forms a related layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is severed, blood clots, blocked access to the heart, and heart attack may occur.
If the clot is released, it can continue with the bloodstream, block the flow of blood to the brain, and cause a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under Brilique’s commercial name, reduces the risk that clots occur less likely.
It is recommended that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice daily for the next three years in the draft NICE Directive, which has been published today.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Care Centre, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will suffer further heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences. ”
Fear of repetition may have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
It has been shown that Ticagrelor, combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the dangers of other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
It is our pleasure to extend the treatment options available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from Ticagrelor’s preliminary recommendation.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited over three years, treatment over this period is not recommended in the proposal.
Computer culture has begun to flourish cheating in Muslim areas
City Mayor Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was called off last year because of corruption, which was associated with the government's report
The culture of political correctness has led to the neglect of the widespread fraud in Muslim communities, the government report says today.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticizes the police, election inspectors and councillors for ignoring the use of voters because of "prejudice to ethnicity and religion."
The former secretary of the community, now the ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said that the intimidation of voters based on their religion was so bad that the police should make cordon and warned voters to protect themselves from the election rooms.
He recommended that voters take identification with them and be able to prove who they were during the election.
At the moment, the electorate is just about to state his name and address.
The report further proposes that the voice be applied to the fingers of the person to avoid having to vote twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
It requests that the press be given more access to documents from the meeting and to decisions taken by the informal committees or working groups.
"It is not only protection against electoral fraud, but also the protection of the local government against the wider corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of an election scandal in the Tower Hamlets in western London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ruled that the incumbent mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his post after charges of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman “synically affected” the religious sense of his Muslim community and silenced his criticisms with accusations of racism and Islamofia.
In his words, Rahman “led his campaign so that it would be the religious duty of the Muslims to vote for him. ”
Up to 300 votes were questioned, or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and gives himself to someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud in the correspondence vote - which is alleged to have been caused by pressure on the older members of the Muslim community during it to vote for the candidates they have chosen.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations on how to clear the electoral system, including presentation of the identity document
The report states: “There has been evidence that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been under pressure to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities from Pakistan and Bangladesh. ”
"There are concerns that... state institutions have kept their eyes closed before such behaviour because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including prohibiting political activists from manipulating correspondence votes and preventing "vote exploitation".
The report now evaluated by Theresa May also asks for more thorough registration checks to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and dose fraud.
Consider asking voters to submit an identity document before the vote.
Using an indelible ink on the fingers of the person in a vote to avoid having to vote twice.
Carry out systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be restricted for a period of three years.
To prevent political agitators and activists from manipulating loyal correspondence votes and electoral envelopes.
Give the police permission to create cordon polling rooms around the polls.
Amend the laws to make it easier to prosecute illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Ban the taking of photos in the election rooms.
Require that only the English (except Wales) work in the polling rooms.
Strengthen training and ensure that staff adhere to the rule that voters go to election booths individually.
Sir Eric criticises the London police and says that it is “surprising” that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litany of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of evidence of the crime.
He also criticises the inexhaustible “check of check boxes” in the polling departments at the town hall.
Sir Eric said: “The trial’s decision in the Tower Hamlets case was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud reference to the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the alarming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities threaten that reputation.
The madness of the cycling duchess Kate and other duplicates of known personalities at the Rio Olympics
The fans of the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 went mad this week at the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevotová, who is quite similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the four-year-old Olympics aren't nearly the only athlete in pursuit of gold this year, who can boast of his own doppelganger of well-known personalities - at least not according to social networks.
At the celebration of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous personalities that are currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL women column has drawn up a list of Olympics that are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As a hunted animal: A member of the American archer team Brady Ellison (left) was compared to Leonard DiCapri from small time.
Next to Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a archer might be a twin of the star Leonard DiCaprio.
A racer from a team of American archers, Brady Ellison, caused a Twitter storm after his pictures came out, which clearly resembled the wolf from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the media madness and admitted that he had heard of his similarities with Leo since he was a little girl.
"I can't see any great resemblance, except for the beards," Brady said for Huffington Post.
"He's a guy and he looks good, so I think he's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt be even more stressed this year: a prominent image between the British jumper to the distance by Greg Rutherford and his favorite actor, Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliye Mustafan, with her big, sharp eyes, was said to be a copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been likened to Gell Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for a change: User thinks Nathan is an "athletic version" of actor from the movie Start (Inception)
Another long comparison is the comparison of the tennis star Rafael Nadal and the actor Josh Hartnett, who have similar thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimsuit Yulia Efimov is proud not only of the same brown skin and blonde hair as Annalyn McCord. And Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team says he looks like "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Good women: Hope Solová (left) and Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face and eyes shape
Not only one: Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed similarity
On waves of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a similar view of couples
One Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction with the fact that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solová and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical.”
Football star Hope Solová and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have really an incredibly similar face and eyes shape.
Among other favorite comparisons is Kerry Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to Laura Linney's actress's smile, or the gold medal holder for Gabby Douglas' gymnastics, proud of her beautiful wide smile, which seems to copy Gabrielle Union's smile, the stars of Bravo, girls!
The CBC Olympic Game Commentator apologizes for the fact that the Chinese swimmer said she "exploded"
The viewers of the midterm live transmission from the Olympic Games at the CBC station disrupted the performance of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhanova by commentator Byron MacDonald.
The Canadian CBC station was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was “stinked like a stench” and “exploded”.
Commentator Byron MacDonald believed that his microphone was disabled when at the end of the final staff of women at 4x200 metres freestyle began to baptize his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was to bring “resurrection” to the CBC's team of commentators, said, among other things: “The little 14-year-old from China gave it up, you fool. ”
Too much excitement, she dragged herself like a stench, exploded.
Thanks.
Chinese swimsuit Ai Yanhanová (14) sailed the second pole of the race at 1:57.79 - that is, 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and made it possible for Canadians to reach China.
The viewers in Canada began calling quickly online and were appalled by the tone and language which the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: “Has the rapporteur declared to the CBC that a 14-year-old swimmer from China “exploded?”???
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the radio."
Ai Yanhan from China in the final female stafet race at 4x200 metres freestyle was described as: “The little 14-year-old from China gave it up, you fool."
Criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all sides and many asked for his appeal
When Twitter users found out how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn't stick around
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted CBC's broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's lively comment and said, "We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimmer who escaped the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
CBC Station finally apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to comments
Co-rapporteur Scott Russell must have apologized on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and filed an apology for more than 90 Twitter users who complained to commentator MacDonald's comments
The station also quickly apologized and published the statements.
She sincerely regrets that those words were spoken, she should not have got into the ether.
We quickly apologized to our viewers in broadcasting and to those watching us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimsuit, not the swimsuit itself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized for live broadcasting and tried to explain his remark by claiming he didn't want her to sound like a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women's staff," said the broadcast from the Olympics at the CBC station.
"I had in mind the performance of the swimsuit and not the person of the swimsuit as such."
"There is no need to say that I didn't mean any disrespect, and I am very sorry."
Customers in Primark abused by a woman who was shamelessly trying underwear in the middle of a store
When a woman took off her clothes to try panties in the middle of Primark, they were not shopping for certain things to look at.
To make it worse, she tried to get her size down, took her panties off and put them back in the rack.
She continued her tour and eventually tried four pairs of panties in the shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Flokeston.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone, where the woman tried her panties before returning them to the shelf.
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said that a mysterious woman had “dressed her clothes and left the store without buying anything. ”
She said: “People couldn’t believe their own eyes. ”
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own pantyhose and panties and put them on.
"She wasn't even trying to find some discreet place - just standing there, sneezing like a monkey."
"Everybody just stared at her panties again and clearly didn't like them because she put them back in the shelf."
She did the same thing with three others before finally deciding she didn't like anything, dressed again and left.
"She seemed fine with who was watching - not even thinking about the person who was maybe buying the panties she was trying to buy."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: “The idea of someone taking home the panties that someone else had on and no one cleaned them.
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I was picking up things that I was obviously trying to pull them off the sale — which is also the right thing to do. ”
"I would imagine bringing home new panties and finding out that there was another woman wearing them, taking them off, and not washing them."
The Primark speaker said: “Primark knows about the incident that took place at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9th. ”
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sales.
How to defend yourself against the attack of weapons using Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com could be a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, the Federation Master of Krav Magy, who resides in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers for a close distance.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain an advantage over a violent man, whether he's approaching you from the front or from the back.
If he gets close to you from behind, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around so that you can see your attacker and "have a free course of shots".
Then you will grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder just before you hit it in the face with a loose elbow.
Then you follow the knee into the weak, and while the attacker is lurking in pain, you twist his gun out of his hand, hit his head in the face and start retreating, you'll hold the gun aimed at him.
If an armed man comes up to you from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the firing line, grab a gun and twist it so that the scoundrel can't shoot.
At the same time, put the force into the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon out of his coil and start retreating, while still aiming at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video, where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get out of the ambush - if you are not the master of Krav Maga - is to issue all cash.
Traveller Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
The British traveler decided to undergo a hard test of his immune system and a dreary reflex - by licking the filthiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and author of the Ian Wright (51), originally from Suffolk, to prove the strength of his immune system, licked the euro banknote with his own language, rails on Piccadilly Circus, flush button on the toilet on the train and Russian public phone.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and everyone he went into.
The experiment that led to Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, however, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the flusher button on a train that has used thousands of other people may seem absolutely puzzling, but perhaps in the kitchen sink there are in fact far more harmful bacteria.
During his journey across Europe, Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals about strengthening the bacteria of the flora and their own health.
Fortunately, none of the things he licked left him with anything worse in his mouth than the smell.
Ian Wright celebrated himself by testing the resilience of his intestines on the journeys around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system safely - from public rails to train stations to flushing
In a film he made about it, he says: “I haven’t cared much for my health since childhood, and I put everything I could into my mouth, from clay to worms and mud. ”
He confirmed his reputation in the film.
The only thing he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple wipe, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia, however, refused to lick after what its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio made a traveler's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strongth, which shows the number of bacteria in various places, such as in the bathroom
In the movie, he said, "This is almost the ugliest thing I've ever felt in the bathroom."
Nothing's more dirty than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strongth was filmed in cooperation with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
Mr Wright was provided with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help people to strengthen the gut bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for refreshments, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow the occupation and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended with the idea of "call Ian."
It is said that the interest in gut health is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into broader contexts - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health and how it is linked to the immune system.
Growing interest in healthy bowels is a worldwide phenomenon and through this document we have provided consumers with interesting information.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s say this, Ian would lose my respect if something of what I wanted him to do — such as the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film.”
To lick some things was naturally easier for Ian, and others were hard again.
I'm glad we made the licks of some dirty stuff."
Valio carried out a survey in 2015, according to which 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria primarily to stomach and intestine health, and 58 percent of respondents indicated that they were using products containing added lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
Family of socially needed prior to eviction destroyed a municipal building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of the socially needed left at their home damage of 50,000 pounds after being charged with terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from a house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long number of complaints against them.
After their forced eviction from the house, apartment officials were shocked to find out that the property was in an emergency condition.
There were holes in the walls, the floor cover was torn, the garbage was rolling all over the floor, and the walls were blown.
The family has already moved out and is thought to live in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried about saving the house.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, as this property is likely to come into the mind as “not quite the nice part” of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their names are notorious.
The couple have three sons who occasionally stayed in the house, and the police have said that the reign that the family took was a street battle using baseball bats, intimidation of the surrounding population, drug use, distribution of drugs, and loud shouting, quarrels, and lashes.
Skeldons (47), whose name was mentioned on the lease contract, were sentenced in June for antisocial conduct.
In several rooms in a house that may be demolished, stinking garbage was found.
In the house where drugs were distributed in the past, a floor cover was ripped out.
Neighbors say they saw them on the street washing, and people called the police here regularly.
Cornwall Housing moved her and her partner out of the house this week after having received an additional 11 weeks period to move out voluntarily.
The neighbors who were relieved welcomed their lives as living hellfire.
One of them said, “They didn’t care about anyone at all. ”
We lived next to them for 20 years, and it was always like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, there's no count at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We're up because there's been incredible silence here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a supervisor in the neighborhood of Cornwall Housing, said that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
Family lived in the house for 20 years, police were regularly summoned to the house
Garbage and old toys were laid in an ingrown part of the common house
He adds: “It is a shame that the tenant could not accept responsibility for her own conduct and for the conduct of her family.
It was a very complex case because their behavior was extreme and their actions by the witness had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team did, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the members of the local community, who were very brave to inform us.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time bear the message that we will not tolerate unsocial behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three of the sons of the tenant who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
Contaminated mattresses left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after removal
Workers will now have to dispose of piles of waste left around the house
In 2014 she carried out police in the house of slaughter and found over 70 grams of hemp, weight, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of holding class B drugs that she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was intended for the basis of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her exodus partner now live in private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they'll seek to relocate tenants who violate the rules of their lease agreements.
Angela Crowe of Denovo and Cornwall Police said that the eviction was a clear message for other tenants who would continue to violate the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can act unpunished, and those who want to follow such behaviour," she said.
The police of Denov and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and non-social behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal scared after a low flight of military jets over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun’s rays in Portugal’s Aveir were scared to death
The aircraft of the Portuguese military air force P-3C Orion flew incredibly low
The Air Force declared that it was a training flight, and it insisted that there was no danger of safety
The moment the low flying jet sank over the filled beach, frightened tourists panicked.
Dramatic footage shows how a military aircraft is reaching almost the distance from the sun’s people on a sandy beach near the town of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of jet engines without seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
There was an incident yesterday afternoon on Costa Nova near the town of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the several holidaymakers who published video recordings of the dramatic flight on social media, said: “The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to collapse. ”
Nuno Arroy adds: “I surfed, and I really thought the plane was going to fall on my head. ”
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were appalled when a low - flying plane appeared out of the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force today declared that the P-3C Orion aircraft pilot was on a training flight to identify fishing vessels off the coast and had to endure low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The flight was allegedly flying something more than usual because of the poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. Nevertheless, the flight insists that the safety of people was not compromised.
Forest fires this summer destroyed part of mainland Portugal and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
Portuguese Air Force today declared that the pilot had to fly low because of heavy fog and smoke from fires that were defending him in the face
The flight was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessel in training.
Half the funeral services do not comply with the rules.
Half the funeral service providers do not comply with the legislation.
The Czech Commercial Inspection (CZOI) found out during the second quarter controls.
According to her, funeral services do not usually inform the remaining ones of their prices or issue written confirmations of receipt of the order.
The Czech Republic imposed 41 fines totalling 73,000 crowns.
Today, her spokesman, Jiří Fröhlich, informed about this.
The inspectors found doubt at 47 out of 95 controls.
In addition to the lack of information on prices and missing confirmations, certain funeral services also sold products or provided services at other prices than that agreed upon.
In five cases the products sold were not properly marked and once the seller used an officially unverified measure.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
It involved urn packagings, candle coverings and vases that were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"As violations of the law continue to occur in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
A London schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
It was announced that Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, died in Syria.
A lawyer named Tasnime Akunjee said that the family learned about her death in the Syrian Rakka a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was probably killed during a Russian air strike in Rakka, which is the garden of the group in the country.
Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee from the war of a narrow country and return to Britain.
"Man wants to believe that the only good thing about this whole thing - like a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers associated with the journey to the war zone - is that it will discourage people from ever making decisions," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from eastern London joined the plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then on the bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultany family learned that she had married an IS fighter in Syria and had been widowed within a few months.
Reid says if Clinton gets elected, he'll leave Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
A senator in the Senate for the democratic side, Harry Reid, says that he believes that the presidential election candidate for the Democrats Hillary Clinton nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the highest court in the event of his election.
The Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the Senate majority, Mitch McConnell, says that the future president will elect the person who will replace the late Judge of the Supreme Court.
Reid said during a conference call Thursday that he believed that Clinton would choose Garland “with a degree of trustworthiness. ”
Reid's spokesman later said that he didn't directly talk to Clinton about whether Garland would nominate and that he was merely speculating.
He valued Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "screw the ship" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the chairman of the federal appeal court in Washington.
Reid said that the republics that block Garland's appointment are "ministers" and "jumpers" of the Republican candidate for Donald Trump's presidential office.
He said Trump didn't fit in the office.
According to the Treaty magazine, naked calendars are for “women and men ”
The Treasures Magazine works closely with photographer David Bellemer to issue a calendar for 2017, inspired by Pirelli's 70th calendar.
But instead of revealing known personalities, try to find another generation of top models for their calendar 2017 NU Mustes.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his naked magazine differs from Playboy from the old school because “Playboy is for men. ”
I do it for women.
Apparently, he believes that the calendar too.
“We have to go back to depicting overtime and classical nudity, when both men and women feel comfortable and are being inspired by photographs of women’s body,” Shaw said in a press release to issue a calendar.
Women want to be a part of this project because it's a wonderful piece of art.
The models can send their images online or personally during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does the vinyl go: who really buys phonograph records?
Vinyl loves lonely middle-aged men.
Before you decide to add a section of comments to the footnotes under the pseudonym Not All IncarcerationMunisIn the Middle Ages, we note that this statement is based on real data.
According to YouGov, so much of the debated resurrection of phonograph boards is associated not with booming millionaires who want to love the original property of physical objects, but with nostalgia of middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are most likely people between 45 and 54 years of age.
Young people between the ages of 18 and 24 are the least likely.
It's not really about gathering an enthusiastic fan - it's all emotional: older people who buy turntables are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and they like themselves (69% versus 66%).
But are youGov's results true?
If this blog were sent as a television report, I would be followed by a camera going out into a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent grey suit and gesticulating. Then I would stop, pull my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's look at it."
So let's take a look at this.
While his charm and charm are slowly lost from Soho's heart - buildings once occupied by independent sellers, hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, cofects and office supplies are now filled - several fantastic specialty stores with turntables remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while. I'll stand near the different men in these shops and try to point out their age and emotional disposition.
Stuart (55), a relative from Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has an afternoon meeting in London and looks at the shops to fill several hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I've got about three or four thousand records.
All these recordings are fixed by the walls of his living room - on the picture above (the photograph was sent to me by e-mail, I did not follow him home).
This huge amount of albums and singles also has because they can afford it: they can now buy turntables that they couldn't afford when they came out originally, and they rebuy what they sold in youth and didn't even have a windre.
“A lot of what I buy is from the late 1960s and early 1970s. These are things that would be published when I was 11 or 12. At the time I was very small and couldn’t get them," he says.
They agree that those who buy the tapes are probably introverts who love their own company, and he adds: “I don’t smoke or drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works in Sister Ray and also thinks that many of the customers he meets fit into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave, people who heard about the comeback and felt forced to buy their old turntables back.
According to my interviews, people got rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their record plates and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their record records back," he says.
This could explain the boom lovers of phonograph boards of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of phonograph boards?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find out in a store like Phonica that in music stores you will find a pleasant community of people with similar thinking.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly damaged by the system of non-contact payments.
In the digital world, some fans of phonograph boards may feel trapped and have opted for known surroundings of phonograph boards, things that trigger memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling the gap or owning something material can bring some comfort,” says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, it's like that with me, and I think there's a lot of people, too.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
“We’re all like their social workers!” says a coworker from a pile of phonograph boards.
A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought vinyl albums a month earlier had not listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of respondents have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy turntables do not have a record player.
At this point in the report he must have seemed really concerned about walking a crowd of boss nova compilations.
The aspect of “trophys” and the revival of interest is something that Johnny (42) noticed, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Someone recently came and said, "I don't have a record player yet, but I want to buy on the radiohead board so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
The percentage is not large, but it happens.
It's more about the product side than music.
People come to us saying, “I don’t have a recorder. ”
These are the younger people, not the older, grown-up teenagers who get into it.
Fapp, where almost one floor is currently reserved with phonograph boards, has many more diverse visitors during my arrival.
There are couple of 70s, tourists who take photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the stores before - from speakers instead of towing jazz is called the latest pop by Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex, it is good to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but intrepid mental trauma is hard to estimate when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) spends several minutes in Fopp looking at various record boards in the discount.
He's one of those guys who's more of a window-watcher than a hottie.
She doesn't make much money in her words, so she doesn't seem to be considering collecting phonograph records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on the computer or something, but the record boards have their magic... ," he sighs eagerly.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a trade that allegedly inspired a new generation of phonograph lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I think I'm very interested in girls in tight jeans and I'm watching a group of 11-year-old girls just ploughing around Polaroid cameras. Then the father and his daughter decide to buy the Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase whose wall is covered with record boards of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of phonograph boards.
No one is looking at them - perhaps because they are only for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they cannot be reached.
It's purely a "vinyl trick".
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the depths of Soho for others, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is probably more time and money than in other areas, is also where it spends the most on the luxury goods it is certainly the vinyl.
But while, according to my findings, youGoov's results seem to be accurate - at least in record-board shops, they do not take into account the large number of vinyl collectors and fans who actually exist, in phonograph stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
I'm sure he doesn't spend the fourth morning wandering around in a record store on Berwick Street, walking the tapes, and avoiding looking at a strange, 30-year-old fake TV moderator who hides behind nothing of the unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The gronian shark is the longest living vertebrate - video reporting
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest average life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says that the recording shows a female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years old and measures 5 meters.
The court in France refused to break down trades in the refugee camp of Jungle
The court in France rejected the order of the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of commission shops and restaurants in Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During this week's court hearing, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 commission stores where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircutting, in commission restaurants sell tea for 50 cents or basic food for several euros.
The Prefect's office in Calais argued that places need to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that doesn't pay taxes and because they mean the risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organisations in the court stated that trades and restaurants are vital and that free food, which offers the state-supported associations and other groups, does not provide food supplement for the growing number of refugees in the camp.
Low-priced shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for people in need.
The court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for preventing people from operating 72 commission trades, but said that the objections of Prefect Calais were "incomprehensible".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role to play than just serving food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said that the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places the Demolition threatened was a coffee shop in camp, Jungle Book Kids, operated by a nonprofit organization that offers 200 meals daily, English and French classes and asylum advice for hundreds of threatened minors without escort in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition for the protection of the “child" coffee shop.
The Guardian received a letter stating that the closure of the coffee shop “was a disaster for these children, some of whom were only eight years old. ”
Charitative organizations Help Refuges and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of refugees in the camp after the steep increase in arrivals during the summer increased to over 9,000 - which is the most so far for the whole time.
He thought he was dead.
Get rid of yourself and the volleyball Ústí.
"Since March, I have been able to practice normally," he reported at the start of summer training in full strength.
What happened to you?
I had a two-sided pulmonary embolism, then a heart condition.
Because when I was at the university in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble has caused a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years, and I didn't know it.
It hurt. Nobody found me anything.
Then the clot went up.
There's a broken vein in the calf, it'll hurt all the time, especially when it's moving or changing the weather.
But nothing that would limit me is more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about life?
He should have.
Last year at the summer tournament in Wooden Mountains, I didn't know I had an embolism, and I couldn't move at all.
I threw up blood tonight.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, and I was completely taken care of for five more days.
I really thought I was dead in Wooden, even my girlfriend and family.
I've seen you somewhere else before.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, and now it's just going to go up.
I know I've got some blood issues, I have to watch myself more when I'm going somewhere.
But you can do anything about it.
Only when I wanted to return to Preparation with Pribram last year did heart problems appear.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I'll knock, I'm physically better at it than I was before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I'm excited, the party looks good, most guys I know.
I'm curious about two other foreigners coming.
I hope we can sit down in human language so we can fit in together.
Will you pick up Ústí?
He had a reputation for being a retard, but every season is different.
Brno was an eighth two years ago, and now the second one is over.
There's a new team in Ústí, only a few players left.
It was the last one in extralysis, so there's a big room for improvement.
If we use it, it's up to us.
We'll see after the first laps, who's gonna be retarded, we don't.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's experienced and he's lived a lot, he'll think better than last place.
But my arrival didn't have anything to do with him, so I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, and I'm a big friend of mine, and it was agreed that it would work here.
I'm not gonna say the name.
Finally, Mr Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for dozens of years, he's a former good player.
He's moving us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to joke, and I like to get an opportunity on a not so top team.
I've been in Pribram for two years, but Ústí's a bigger challenge than being on the sixth team, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a stranger, he's been training Australian Boehm in Ústí.
What's he look like?
I know him by chance, we played against each other in a group at the university.
And we had a couple of times together, and sometimes we sat together after the games, so we know each other, and we know each other, and we know each other.
We beat them 3-1, immediately at the start of summer preparation in Ústí.
He's got a slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
American Nadazdin and Brazilian Z will arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote to an American, he looks like a nice guy, Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
Did you contact the American?
It felt like a good idea.
I'm a recorder, so whoever's making it, I should be communicating with everyone.
I immediately found out what this player was, I found him playing on the Internet, I saw some videos.
He seemed fine, boy jumping, he's tall.
On Facebook we wrote a few messages, he seemed like a joke, he'd fit in with us.
How do you look forward to the position of the recorder number?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm only going to be twenty-four, and I have no character to change.
I'd rather be in the middle of something than be led by someone else.
I guess I don't want to play anymore if I'm supposed to be like the second recorder and give it a full time.
How many times have you been one?
Half a year in Pribram, when it didn't go to Kustov as captain, he got hurt, then there was money trouble and he left.
We've been up since then, and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, where I'm a resident, I've changed one and two.
The great year was in Old Town, and after that I had a lot of offers, and he just picked Pribram.
Budejovice wanted me there, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short half stays the Phelps domain.
"To be once again on the stage of the winners and to hear the anthem is sweet as ever," Phelps laughed and had his eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother were once again in the audience, the son of Boomer this time sleeping quietly with the headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming racing and in a few hours it'll be over, he said touching.
In the finals behind Phelps almost two seconds behind the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won the long position.
Bronz received Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Cup.
After Alu Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (distant) is Michael Phelps the third athlete who mastered the same discipline in four games after himself.
After most of the race, Phelps and other Americans led Ryan Lochte and domestic Thiago Perreira.
While the defense attorney of gold in the final king's 50s set himself up for a rough finish, they fell outside the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance in Rio to expand his unique medal collection.
Shortly after the festive announcement, the half-breed went to the finale of the race to 100 metres of butterflies.
The legend could not be overshadowed by the landscaper Ryan Murphy, who won the double double, won the 100th in Rio and the double line.
In the final, he left 37 hundred Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin behind, and the third was the Russian of Jevgenij Rylov.
While Murphy has only a fifth place from last year's world championship of two hundredths, in Rio he became a master's king.
Larkin was seated from the imaginary throne, to which he succeeded at the world championship last year.
But at the Olympics, he only won the medal now.
A Canadian woman named Penny Olexiaková and an American woman Simone Manuel shared the gold in her hundreds.
For 16-year-old Olexiak, it was the fourth medal for these games, for Manuel's second silver medal from the staff.
Swimmer gold won the OH as the first African-American in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for all those who come after me, the sport becomes love for them, and they get to where I am, Manuel is touched.
The third was Swedish Sarah Sjöström, who won a 100-metre butterfly race in Rio, and still has two hundred-foot silver.
By the sixth, Australian Cate Campbell's world record was over.
In the 1970 ’ s, Japan’s Rie Kanet won its first Olympic medal.
It has no precious metal or from the world championship, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russia's Julia Jefimov, who, in spite of the doping past, struggles with the hostility of viewers and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won the trial, and I don't know why I should still answer those questions.
I'm so tired of it, the Russian swimsuit said.
The right to start in Rio was required only in the case of a special panel of sports arbitration CAS just before the game began.
They've been dealing with my appeal, and I've won.
If anyone likes it or doesn't, or if he has a different opinion about turning to arbitration, she added.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs have had a special day.
Only less than an hour before the game, they found out who they were going against.
They must have brilliantly mastered tactical training.
And then, in a non-traditional time, they started a game on small court number one.
The first set did not start well, then they reached the head of the rival, but in the state of 19:19 did not manage the final.
The second was clearly better and compared, but the decisive tie-break did not work out.
Above all, a series of damaged services meant a 10:15 loss and a goodbye with the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated Russia," said Hermann.
How would you rate a game?
Hermann: After an unfortunate start, before I played, we made it to the game.
In the end, in the last balloon, the income that I used to get used to.
We lost a hundred, which was the key.
In the next set, we came up with an overview of the field, another defense, and we pushed the service.
There's been a lot of mistreatment in the thie-breaker, where we've been stripping this site.
It was a disappointment because we could beat Russia.
It's too bad at the start of the first set, we ran away.
We were able to download it, but we missed the daggers.
The second set was great and the third one decided the service.
We've made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points, and by the five, we hesitated a lot.
It's a shame because the Russians were playful.
How was your little castle number one?
Case: Similar in China on the side yard.
The environment and the atmosphere were different.
There was an hour at night, total silence, no music, nothing.
That was the difference from the center.
We wouldn't have chosen such terms, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the game when you found the names of the rivals an hour before the game?
Hermann: She was strange.
We started training for the game without knowing the players, so we couldn't do tactical training like the other teams.
But Simon (Dog Nausch) prepared tactics for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of tactical papers prepared, so after this page we were pretty well prepared.
Do you remember ever starting a match at midnight?
Hermann: I don't think so.
We were in the middle of the eleventh, but not twelve.
Russian Birlov's block in front of the playoffs at OH in Rio.
Beach volleyball girls Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in a hug in front of the playoffs at OH in Rio.
Was it awkward?
Case: By playing the last two games in a group of ten, we had a regime moved earlier.
This was two more hours.
It's strange, I can't imagine that another sport has athletes who have to give their best performance at twelve o'clock.
But I think we've prepared as best we can.
We knew it would be, but it's not typical, and I guess it won't be my favorite time to play.
How do you evaluate Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the process of the group was our goal, it is on the one hand okay, good.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Sluková: I will sleep from it, and from tomorrow I will remember only positively the Olympic tournament.
Big brother's here, here comes the first sniffing SIM.
You're not gonna get away from her.
The new rules are to apply to all persons without Thai passport who decide to take the SIM of one of the local operators on their stay in Thailand.
Not only for tourists, but also for those with long - term visas who, for example, work in Thailand or close marriages there.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting Office and the Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, informed that there would be no exceptions.
The sale plan of SIM intended exclusively for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator in early August.
The new measures allowing monitoring of their position are intended by the authorities to be implemented within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of maintaining national security that will enable foreigners to deal with criminal activity.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIMs help to identify those who exceed the allowed length of stay.
For sellers, there should also be a special SIM for foreigners on the side of the SIM designated exclusively for Thais by six months.
The difference will be the monitoring function, which will be permanently switched on for cards intended for persons without Thai passport.
It won't be possible to shut it down.
"This feature for Thai SIM is not because we can always easily track," Tantasith added.
It is necessary to add that in Thailand prepayments are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires identification.
On the other hand, for several years one of the operators distributed free launch SIM to tourists at airports.
They were so completely anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand considers ten telecom regulators from other Asian countries, such as Malaysia or Singapore.
Even at present, there is a mandatory registration of SIM, but the legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the measures envisaged do not mean an obligation for a foreigner to enter the country of the local operator’s SIM.
Of course they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short.
Operators of the country concerned shall only know relevant network information after the notification of the SIM to their network.
So they know the phone number, but not the owner's information.
However, the difference between roaming prices and local operator rates is so pervasive that even most tourists will start looking after local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The efforts of the authorities to control the movement of foreigners living in Thailand have been legally subject to immediate criticism.
The Tantasith situation calms down and, in the context of privacy, the planned system compares the obligation to provide a residence address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if a particular person is to be monitored.
Any abuse of the system will threaten a nearer undetermined punishment.
"If a service provider follows the position of SIM without a court order, he will be charged with a crime," Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While currently there is a recycling of a specific number until after the 90-day period after which the SIM did not apply to the network, new ones could occur after 15 days if Thailand was abandoned.
The luxury apartment in the new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a whirlpool on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in the new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where most of the care of the property is provided by the administrator.
The condition was sufficient parking spaces and elevators in the house, which essentially disqualified the older buildings.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old homes, problems with swinging floors, high energy intensity and so on.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old construction was unable to offer.
More interesting visits can be found in Modern apartment magazine.
The whole interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langer and her colleague Camilo Polák from Artiga Studio.
Why did you call them?
Would you recommend cooperation with everyone's expert?
Cooperation with the architect would recommend that everyone, if he proposed an apartment from the beginning, is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a significantly better idea of a range of possible materials, and based on the customer’s wishes, they are able to harmonize the interior appropriately.
We worked with architect Lenko Langer on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us even in the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrad.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wished a generous social-accommodation space with an adequate background for a four-member family known as a modern but not a cold interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment with the terraces and implement intelligent household control.
And, of course, the quality of implementation had to be safeguarded.
Did you leave everything to experts, or did you intervene in the final form of the interior?
We have approved all designs including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design has always come from architects.
In the beginning, we have determined what we expect from design, and we have shown some elements of the interior that we would like to include in the proposal, such as carpets or images.
I think it is precisely our collection of mostly Czech authors including works by Karl Malich, Karl Vyshimil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund of architects that helped guide us in our taste.
Also, the combination of black, white and walnut wood was the idea of architecture as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art etc.
Were there any complications that caused you to give up your original ideas, or did you want to join the new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the construction at the moment when it was first possible to climb to the height of our floor, and found that the views we had planned were actually shadowing the surrounding building.
That's when we literally changed the disposition from the base to the night.
A gulp was used on the kitchen line and on the roof of the fireplace wall.
In the interior, wooden surfaces are then dominated by complemented skins, such as the face of Norma’s dining and bar chairs from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make any changes here or is there something you'd like to have today?
I believe that this is a modern air interior, which primarily fulfills its purpose.
We are not going to change, most adjustments after moving have taken place in shadowing and housing terraces.
Perhaps the only solution is to the floor, when the nut wood is shown to be too delicate to the dog’s household.
The word architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornyová, authors of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to make a completely new distribution solution and several other adjustments within the construction.
For the interior, it is an important element of the position of the lamps in the ceiling of the corridor and the main toilets.
That's how we got daylight into the darker space of the apartment.
Also direct entry from the main bathroom on the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the construction modifications that was very useful for the function of the entire apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a whirlpool.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, part of the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, which then got me to work in a magazine.
So why did you choose to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel like I was choking in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere between people.
I thought every Frenchman was so negative.
People in France are negative moods in general, but it has worsened lately.
What's interesting is that you're mentioning negativeism.
Some people value the Czech character that way.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not find it that way when they come to France, because they don't feel so much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
A big topic is money.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there's a problem with people's behavior towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking at me because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel well in France.
My family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I've been looking for a job pretty much anywhere else, and I ran into an opening at Air France right here in Prague.
I admit I didn't know Prague at all from the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was going on in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
Now I've been here for three years, and I can't imagine living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch any negative reactions or nagging, but I feel like people are more free here.
That I can do anything, dress anyway and no one will judge me.
In France, someone is still looking at you awkwardly, perhaps when you have special clothes and so on.
In Prague, I began to feel really free.
The thirsty don't care for that kind of thing.
Where do you work now?
After my job in Air France, I worked for a travel site for a while.
Then another friend and I set up websites on which people offer and seek shared housing.
We are only working in Prague so far, but we would like to extend it to all of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are Czechs from half, and two other Czech friends.
I have to say, the next specific of Czechs is that at first they keep their distance more.
He won't let someone near his body like that.
That's quite different from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses on the face.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned you didn't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I find it quite simple in Prague, because perhaps everyone here speaks English.
Even in dinners or food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And since everyone can at least communicate a little in English, I don't have the need to learn a language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you ever encountered any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Actually, no.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
I'm thinking of one experience.
My leader, the Czech Republic, once told me about the French football team and said something in terms of: They are not French, but African.
That touched me quite a bit.
But if anyone had a problem with me being a Muslim, it hasn't happened to me.
Even though my colleague once reminded me of some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He said don't let me go downtown, I'm gonna get fed up.
The anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is that nowadays anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I had not been able to imagine that something like this would have happened in France.
And it's not just about Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel about terrorists defending themselves with your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel cold and guilty, even though I shouldn't feel this way at all.
I try not to follow the reports of violence too much, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met at Jiří Square in Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, the Czech Muslims, together with Christians, demonstrated against violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know that.
But I understand that people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't cause?
Do you meet in Prague and other Muslims?
My associates, for example, are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have a pretty wild discussion of Islam, because we each see it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through another education, maybe they taught Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People of Islam sometimes associate with the subordinate status of women.
How do you feel about that?
I don't think under any circumstances.
On the contrary.
I'm a woman, I have strength.
It also has to do with you not wearing any headgear.
Hijab, for example?
And it's signed primarily by the way I was raised.
For example, my mother is a truly fundamental Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is purely personal.
It's up to everyone to interpret it.
When a person reads the Quran, he should take his own view of these things.
So when I read a passage in the Koran that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself, "I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect it, and if I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where scarves require it, I will marry it.
Are you planning on staying in Prague?
So far, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but I'm great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is an ideal city for that, I think.
The Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against violence.
Sailor Kozel's Fencl's wind in Rio crashed into the stages.
Friday sea trips in the Brazilian Riu de Janiero went out to Czech yachtsman Veronica Kozelska Fenclová.
In Laser Radial class, she moved before the final two trips to the tenth place.
This would ensure the Czech Republic's participation in the final ride.
Packets are collected like pommons.
They want to compete with transporters.
The idea of using the already planned route to transport shipments is followed by TV director Matěj Liška and manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
The idea was to breathe the life of three applications with different geographical reach.
We launched the National Transfer app in May.
At this point, there are thousands of cities recorded in it, and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn it first, before we focus more on abroad, says in an interview for iDNES.cz a 14-year-old manager.
How does the Transfer application work and who can benefit from it?
You take it off and register for free.
Then you can specify the route and the data how big a package you can transfer and how much you want.
Someone's asking for a ride on that day.
When the route and time of delivery match up, each of us will be notified each other.
At that moment, a chat will open where the two can arrange a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register for each package to always find its courier?
I don't know, I can't estimate how many registered and how many roads it takes to make the coverage completely optimal and each offer coincides with demand.
It's already working on the main tracks, and it's logically easier than it needs to be on the road between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are building trust, and they're finding out no one's running away with the package.
You didn't have to deal with a case like this yet?
How many users has the service two months after the launch?
Right now, we have about 5,000 to 6,000 people making way.
We consider this to be a success, and we believe that more will be packed.
Doesn't he threaten to wait too long for the sender?
We hope that we will be competition for large conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the thing for another day and for a fraction of the price.
You will pay several thousand for delivery in two hours for a large company.
You're going to pay a hundred or less here, because that's the path that someone's already taking.
Should traditional carriers fear a possible loss of customers in the future?
We hope so.
The market has enormous potential, feeds here huge transnational carriers, as well as commercial chains, where everyone began to shop and gradually discover that quality does not correspond to what they are paying for.
No one wants to find a ticket in the mailbox with a message that they're supposed to pick up the package on the branch, first of all the day after 7:00.
At the time, I needed a package for six hours, and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and more functional service that will not annoy anyone and send the competition a signal to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Not one has ever acted in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as the manager of the music club, Matthew Fox as the TV director.
In 2014 they started preparing the Shippancee LTD application, which uses the already planned route between world metropolises, especially the aircraft.
In 2015, they set up a project to process a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming lasted three quarters of the year and the application was placed on the market in March 2016.
The Transvestite applications began to develop in December last year and published this year in May.
This is a local version of Shippancee adapted for the Czech market.
The Mesík and Mesík Profi applications have been developed since this January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to do all these applications from the beginning, which one day connects in one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to adjust the application and then focus more on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor.
The shared economy has recently been a subject and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Don't you have concerns about action in an area that no one can say much about so far, where is the border of sharing and where is the gray economy?
It's the same, just another product.
We understand that if it succeeds and we go with it up, we will be another thorn in the eye through the grey economy.
But even though someone saves money and makes money, it is not intended to go around financial and tax controls.
Each user, either on the one hand or on the other, will be urged to tax his income if he makes it his income.
What makes you think the service has such potential?
The sender saves and earns the carrier, and will reduce the cost of the journey.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
At a time of social networking, which people share, we'd like this one to draw closer together.
There may be nice stories, people are happy to help and talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
People in my opinion have been lacking personal access for a long time, and we call this application a service to people.
How, then, do you guarantee that the courier does not leave with the package?
Each user of the application, along with the registration, will scan a civil card and indicate a bank connection, payment card or credit card.
These are channels that give both service and credibility to man.
Couriers also collect stars based on sender ratings.
We also offer insurance, we still have the details.
In the event of loss or damage, the courier shall not assume liability under criminal law for the contents if there is something illegal inside and does not know about it.
If he's stopped by the police and found in a closed package in his trunk a rifle or ten kilos of hashish, he's a criminal liability to the dispatcher.
Is there no threat of abuse of sensitive data from the database?
They shall be registered by the supervisory authority, where necessary, who shall be the only one who shall be able to see it, and we ourselves shall not be able to see it, the data against abuse shall be protected.
How much money does a courier get after a successful delivery?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he's going to ask for.
The sender is charged several per cent for making contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push the volume.
Nor can anyone accuse the courier that he did not deliver the consignment when he actually delivered it, the takeover and delivery is verified by QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
In relation to the size or content of the package?
You can carry anything.
We have three sizes, small as a butter cube, medium as a plato egg and big as a bass beer.
Then there's no further restrictions, and if anyone has a seat in the car, maybe they'll take over the fridge.
Plus the sender has the ability to take pictures of the package in the application, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don't even have to pack things if you don't want to hide the contents.
You're gonna put a sweatshirt in your hand and that's it.
Who came up with an idea and how long did it take to start the service?
A friend got an idea more than two years ago, and I didn't pay much attention to it at the time.
Then he showed me a demo of a transnational app aimed mainly at passengers.
At that moment, I told him I wouldn't be looking for an investor, but I would like to become an investor and save my own life.
The next year was the development of the company Shippancee LTD due to the greater credibility of the entire product in London.
But this isn't the version that you're focusing on now.
No, we focused on the Czech Republic, where we try to improve the app because it all had birth pain and still has a lot to solve and improve.
We are trying to react to feedback from customers and we are not dealing with so much foreign market right now.
We know it's a long run, but we don't get it, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippancee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were in their own way upgrades.
The transfer occurred when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that at least we will learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application of the Moon is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to an exact address on the other end of the world.
It works for senders as well as the Transfer, but the difference is that in it as a courier you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator on your mobile.
The app for couriers who want to feed on it, we called it the Moon Pro.
So someone can make a profit by picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the last app will be downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make the way to work.
Now that everyone's messing with these pommons, they can pick this up just the same.
A man sees where the orders are, comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and transports it.
It's cheaper than competitive services.
At the moment, we are still making a web interface that will be very difficult for companies to send, and they will fill out information about them, or create points on the map.
Then we are able to use their services every month.
Are you now committed to a full-time project?
It extorts us, but we have it normally when we work so that we can feed and develop the project.
We're not being followed by a strong multinational investor, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea, and the other jumped into it with other incentives and ideas.
We are now looking for an investor strong enough to be able to spin with us not the Czech market, but who should go with us to the global product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The storytelling part of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring almost forgotten variety.
It will fix the second part, and the solo game in it will be much more colorful than in Call of Duty, according to the first information.
The length is going to be around the standard eight hours and the filling is going to be just from the concept of the net charge in the first part.
It is therefore possible to look forward to the freedom of movement, which in addition to running, includes the possibility of using the battle titan.
In addition to action passages, the game will contain levels that are specifically focused on reverse movement.
They're going to remind us of platformies and include rebuses.
Thus, double jumps, running around the walls and chain slides are essential for overcoming them.
In addition, enemies will need to be destroyed.
There will also be no maps of the maze and the levels with special concepts.
In one instance, it will be possible to lift and tear the platforms down and close the powerful door.
That's how you're going to take the form of a battlefield.
The pace of the game should be able to oscillate between furious action and calmer moments for exploring an unknown planet.
We're going to play pawn of Jack Cooper's dream of a pilot's career.
Cooper, at the start of the campaign with Captain Lastimosa, will crash on Typhon's alien planet, which remains enemy soldiers.
And no wildlings will be acceptable to him.
In addition, Lastimosa will use lethal wounds during the crash, and Cooper will therefore be tasked with operating the captain's Titan.
His dream of a pilot's career will come true before he expected it.
But the first step is to steal the battery necessary for a robot repair.
Cooper's phone calls with the Titan will also be important.
Players are used as a source of information on the soldier's past, but at the same time a robot-separate communication will create humorous moments.
For example, if the Titan is to name all the injuries that Cooper is in danger of incurring during the planned climb.
The first information on the Titanfall 2 campaign was provided by the Polygon server.
Moreover, the result will be possible in two months and Bonusweb will give you the first impression of the network game after Gamesco.
Titanfall 2 comes out on October 28th for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ mark will come to life, but the original publisher remains dead.
Sweden's Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ in 2013, it gained a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and name of the company.
Nordic, for example, published the Darksiders 2 Death Edition or the Red Function Collection package.
In addition, 23 other games have been created for publishing and 13 of them have not yet been discovered.
Thirty years ago, when I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a younger man, our neighbor, twenty years old.
I knew it from the beginning - first apparently for a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she used to date someone like me.
She's gone completely mad at him.
In those first days, her voice even changed, she had this girl's love voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
I've been watching the whole thing.
At that time, he regularly went out of work at half-fourth, and so she always left at three for shopping.
Every day she tried to see him.
Later, I found out they were meeting at his house in the laundry room.
How many times I knew they were there.
I took care of the keys, he was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, I've always stayed home.
I've never been able to go there, make the decisive move.
You may laugh at me, but I believe that my wife had thought of me.
Soon, I think she found that I was manageable, that I would do what she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just a copper.
At that time, the neighbors indicated that they knew about it too.
I was such a jerk that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke down, it would be bad.
That it would happen to everyone in the family, there was nothing but a daughter.
So I've always put it off, and on and on and on.
But one day, I went to his apartment, and I needed help in the laundry room.
He went there with me, and I told him that I got anonymous, that he was dating my wife, and that he was testifying.
I asked him what to say.
He was standing there, he was shivering his shoulders, he was looking at the ground, and he didn't say a word.
Then I also met his wife on the way from the store at that time.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond to it, and she didn't say anything to me.
Nobody told me anything at the time.
I'm the kind of person who's never gone anywhere that has a problem getting to know someone, let alone find a woman.
So I wasn't even thinking about getting a divorce.
I kept relying on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her and her life would go on.
It wasn't like that.
And I've never really dealt with it.
I have it in me today.
I used to give it to her a lot of times, but I finally let it go.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more like my wife's my housekeeper.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's busy.
I always think she was trying to make me have no other reason to complain.
And you could say she's nice.
But sometimes I want to stroke her, hug her, and she won't let go.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks we have a happy marriage.
But she once told me that she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I can see that he loves him to this day, he's her god.
And I don't get bored with that kind of life.
When it started, and I took it very badly, I once told her that I didn't want to live, and I asked her what she would say if I had done it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree to it or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought about it and finally she said, "But there are plenty of places here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
Following terrorist attacks, France has stepped up its fight against radical Islamists and has called on the government and the local Muslim minority to help.
"If the Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom of recognition," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only the spiritual education in France is preached in the country.
He also wants to stop funding from abroad, where money often comes from preachers vaccinated with jihads.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Islamic Foundation, founded by the then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
It should have already contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that financed their construction.
Soon, however, she was struck by internal strife, and that is why she never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," said Valls.
The former Minister of Interior and Defence Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as the Secular State, is apparently headed by the new foundation.
In France, there are approximately 2,500 mosques and prayers, about 120 of them serving radical Islam.
Since 2012, the French authorities have evicted about 80 Islamic clergy from the country, and they have considered this step for several decades.
This week, German police also attacked jihadist clergy.
The Imams allegedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated an area where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate began in France about a new institution, which will replace the functional foundation.
All hasten further terrorist attacks in the name of the Islamic State by the radical Islamists.
The new Foundation will have two main tasks – to ensure funding of mosques from domestic resources and to supervise their properties.
However, it is not clear where it receives funding, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for the halal food, especially meat derived from defeats under Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by the vendors for the sale of food and for the granting of a permit.
Part of the money would then travel to the budget of the foundation.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mexico.
Each year, about 30,000 of them leave France for their traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, only preachers who have studied educational programmes at the universities there should operate in French mosques.
As a result, their preaching should be in harmony with democracy.
The government also closes radical mosques.
"We have closed 20 of them since December and others will follow," said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"In France there is no place for those who report hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was badly injured by an unknown shooter on Friday morning at a shopping mall in northern Spain's Zaragoza, writes the Independent daily.
The shooting took place after a woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car in front of the shopping mall, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, writes the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an unharmed daughter, and an ambulance had to come for a man in critical condition.
The act took place around 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the Autonomous Region of Aragonia, near the local university.
With an appeal to the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably an unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Coins with bushes, wakamas, ginger and chili sauce.
Summer wishes light, well digestible meals, only we Czechs are rebels and we have our taste and our head.
And so from summer pretzels smells like grilled hamsters, bicep, pork cologne.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, except for salad or baked vegetables.
True, grilling is time-saving and kitchen-saving, and it is a social issue and no one has to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to how to make good treats, which special dining, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fry or choke.
And they're going to make us healthy.
Whether it is homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality raw materials and a few well-acquired griffins will suffice to make preparation fun and food the true exotic delicacy itself.
Like even lighter rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
There is even a time-consuming way of cooking and cooling rice.
The paper can only be softened for a moment in the water and then it's all about the cook's fantasy as it's going to play with the fillings and accessories.
There's no algae like algae.
The advantage of a number of dishes in Asian cuisine today is that raw materials are generally available.
Including an acidic ginger, which is one of the basic flavours accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the right pink garry ginger has a unique spicy sharp yet delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe that mixes with a few kinds of vinegar and ginger.
All you need to do is buy a bag of appropriate size, and the annex with proven antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is done.
Banana leaves.
They are especially used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes in various festive occasions and rituals.
Long ribs of banana leaves are very common in a number of countries in Asia or South America as well as as a "help" to prepare a variety of roasted, cooked and fried dishes, which are packed in them in the same way as the albalom.
The banana leaf will then pass on a specific flavor.
In our shop you can buy exotic fruits and vegetables, even cut in the form of bicycles.
Choose, however, only the leaves full of green, and therefore healthy - unspoiled and stainless.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare a salad made of wakame, sesame and sesame oil.
Because he can be bought frozen again.
Anyone who often prepares sushi for her will likely know the algae of the nut in particular.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, from which it is produced by cutting, pressing and drying the so-called leaf of the nori – that is to say, flakes intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame – dark green algae growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaidó – is also fresh and dried and is as popular as the algae of the nut.
By the way, who wouldn't know the mission of the Wakama soup, Asian women are allegedly using it to recover from birth.
And even this eyelash has almost miraculous effects.
Clean blood, strengthens blood circulation, even supposedly prevents hair graying and is literally filled with mineral substances.
Dried and broken wakame also serves as spices, for example, to taste rice.
Fresh algae are first allowed to relax in the water, then burst into boiling water, and half a minute of cooking.
Then it cools down in the icy water, cuts out the middle ribs and continues to adjust, like a favorite salad.
However, buying it is already ready, frozen, the easiest solution.
So all that remains is to wrap the roll with an easy vegetable filling, smooth and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a longevity bomb.
If you resist and don't throw in an extra grilled bean.
Eat healthy, light and summer.
The Asians know how to do that.
Just a few special ingredients and a little goodness, and you have an interesting fresh meal that nicely combines flavors.
And it's done once or twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g white radish, 100 g green oak, 60 g salad cucumbers, 60 g wakame algae and 60 g sweet chili sauces.
Grass of chopped coriander, spoon of black sesame, spoon of sriracha chili sauce, 20 g manga and 40 g of loaded ginger garri, a little pine nuts.
Let's get the bandages ready first.
We put rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we take it out and wait for it to cool down.
In the meantime, in hot water, we're going to have a little bit of a bit of a cartilage, about three minutes later, we're going to let them cool quickly into the icy water so they don't lose color.
We'll put vegetables on the allowed paper and pack it up.
We will prepare the fillings from white radish, carrots and salad cucumbers, which we cut into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add chopped coriander, thoroughly mix and put on rice paper.
On the banana leaf, we insert the breadcrumbs, add the screws, and at the end, we decorate the whole meal with an algae wakam, loaded with ginger, mango, sprinkle black sesame and add some pinion nuts.
Britain must be satisfied with silver in 7 rugby, choose Fiji takes gold
The impressive performance of the United Kingdom in the seven-piece rugby ended with a devastating mark on the last obstacle, Fiji defeated Britain in the final match Thursday evening at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio at 43:7.
The Fijis taught a master's lesson in processing, folding, bending, supporting games, running to line and brutal forces - and gained gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with an unsavory price of comfort in the form of a silver medal - for Britain third on a given day - and the British could be proud of New Zealand, Argentina and the South African Republic at their performances in the inaugural Olympics.
The winning victory over the South Africans 7:5 in the semifinals on the same day, it may have frozen in the final.
However, Fiji would defeat a 15-member team in its form in full health.
Most likely, it won't be a comfort to the British, but they can rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around their neck tomorrow: the chief coach of Fiji is Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain has hurt a bit of the way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost every game in Adelaide Sevens.
This is where they lost the only one.
This defeat is painful, but progress is irrefutable.
Fiji began with grandeur, British breakthroughs reflected joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates, it was like running behind a number of buses in motion, and world cup champions were 5-0, when Osea Collinsau emerged from behind the corner.
The timing showed four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing, from which the conversion was made.
12:0 and Britain has hardly touched the ball.
Great Mitchell tried to stop the giant Leon Nakarawa and stop him score three, but only Fijani slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw a touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another one when he returned, and there were still more than 1 minute left... of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouwa then penetrated the tiny British and ran into the shit where he scored.
After conversion to state 29:0 followed a break.
It was like Fiji for rugby 7s was born, while the British were still learning handovers.
That's exactly how it is.
After a half-time, the British made many changes, and the Fiji forces stopped... for four whole minutes, which, compared to the first half, was good, until after the brilliant match, Fiji Josua Tuisova continued.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, threw a touchdown in the left corner at an increase of 36:7. The match was already won by the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands and their fans sang, waved flags, and danced.
It was hard not to admire the completely joyful attitude of the Fijins.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame further tried to defeat the Fijis.
The whistle came in, the Fijis hugged, and the British fell on the lawn completely down.
Even before the same day Fiji in the semifinal defeated Japan 20:5 and the United Kingdom defeated the South African Republic in a close semifinal - the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half to lead, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling work, broke through the defensive line and scored in the second half under the hook.
Marcus Watson's great late dump, brother Anthony of England's 15th team, secured a victory - and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, to win the rowing race, inspired the battle of a cancer coach.
You won't find any more emotional gold on these games, and that's what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during the 220 punishing exhales to history Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Even though two were sitting in a row, there were three voices in the boat. When the boat whistled at the level to meet the second Olympic gold behind them in the race of women's doubles, there was still a voice on board with them by coach Robin Williams. They were the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their advantage was absolute, in total it was their 39th race, in which they remained unsurpassed.
What we see - two excellent athletes, as they fly down the water level with the elegance of swans - does not reflect the nature of victory completely.
For every gold medal from the rowing is a battalion of helpful hands that amount to a bit of difference, and no hand was more helpful than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago didn't know if this day would happen when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer, which can be operated on, and I have undergone this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It'll change your perspective on things.
The cancer was detected to Williams in December 2013.
Happiness for the whole trio was that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, and shorten the drop to the minimum - if so we can call it that.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together fast.
That was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing by itself is the way, but this has been a little more difficult.
Immediately after the victory were their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous this morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to overcome his own unrest.
Stanning, the captain of the Royal artillery regiment, who is behind her mission in Afghanistan, said: “This week I was emotional at the bottom, it may be a bit extreme, but it means so much. ”
Again, it highlights how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked and so did Robin.
Up until now, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he's got a huge thanks, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't wish for a better man for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost one race in five years.
The two set up an overwhelming rhythm that their rivals could not cope with.
Even in the final 500 metres when the New Zealand and Denmark crews began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
At the moment, we focused at the most.
Helen said, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't want to achieve something famous.
We weren't looking forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to get a good lookout, go out and win the race, which we did.
The two will take a year to think about it before they decide what to do next.
Glover's getting married next week, and her next week is Steve Backshall's TV adventure.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was going to be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It makes me feel much better," she said.

Prison?
More like driving people for free, says taximan Rubesh to a break-in charge.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate in Prague are accused, according to the C.T.
You've recorded a number of reports in which you've discovered the fraudulent practices of those who are to be in the group that will stand before the court.
You've faced a few unpleasant confrontations with exposed actors.
How much is the report on the prosecution of members of the organised group breaking down for you?
I was expecting there to be a court of law.
I'm mostly curious about the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
That's useless.
They should return all the money they stole first.
And they should return them so that they can drive all the people for free.
That's a bit of a forceful solution.
Does this mean that you do not consider any punishment to be sufficiently effective?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so afraid that they're not doing the job anymore.
For example, one makes a ping, another makes a pizza, and one of them gives up on it.
The defendants can theoretically receive two to eight years in prison.
Do you think it's an appropriate rate?
In general, I have a problem with taking away my freedom.
I think it's a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in that case, is nonsense.
People like that should return the company that took her.
For a quarter of a century, they committed the destruction of our country’s name and the misrepresentation of its people.
So now let them make a good card and distribute people for free.
I can't imagine.
It would work like community service.
As someone going to collect garbage, they'd get a car and drive people all over Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll eventually get a condition, and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Film Academy Miroslav Ondříček in Písek and then at the University of Tomáš Bati in Zlín.
It belongs to people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the website in the Czech Republic.
He works as editor for the Stream.cz Internet TV, where he participates in a series of shows, now prepares Prague Guide, which is primarily intended for foreign viewers.
The Rubesh, in the form of short reports, advises which services he prefers to avoid in Prague and which he recommends to be used without fear.
He used to film a series with the names How to, City of Fraud?, Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Dusty.
The prosecution refers to them as an organized group.
The police followed her for months.
Is it possible to call such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers mobsters?
They're such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from the Godfather.
It's more about mobs - juniors, but they're organized.
It's just that they're guarding each other's staffs.
Prague is all torn apart.
I tracked that, for example, the main station does not like Paris, Paris does not like itself with taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Lázně (disco club)
Everyone's just guarding their own place, and each group is somehow organized.
It's probably a web.
However, the defendants are together only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate who warned the driver against checks.
As you say, the side effects of the streets have not disappeared.
So what percentage do you think of among the Prague fraudsters in the taxi service?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street still are.
For example, I am talking about Aleš Ryjákov.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he rides a telescope earring in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at Karl's Bridge and drives people.
Last time I went with him, he wanted me seven hundred miles away.
He wasn't detained by the police for some reason.
They only picked a few people out of the whole big group.
The same situation is, of course, in other locations of Prague.
Thus, the prosecution of seven people will hardly eliminate the already famous Prague scum, which apparently has much greater dimensions.
Of course it's not for nothing.
It will help, but all evil will not be washed away, that is true.
Are there taxi drivers who steal foreign tourists, still in the same places you showed in the reports, Karl Bridge or Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
In these locations they stand every day and violate the decrees every day.
It ignores both the city police and the Prague Magistrate.
It's not even a cat anymore, it's a complete disregard.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet some of them, although only part of the group, will be brought to trial.
It's already a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: do you feel satisfied?
If I were to take it as a compensation, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and will always be, to improve the centre of Prague.
And even though I feel like it's a little bit better, I'm gonna keep doing it.
You need to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to remove him.
I can't settle for that.
But it's not like that, of course there are more.
Are you still trying to confront them right in the cabs?
Sometimes I do a test drive, and I have to say, it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a cab driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged himself 560 crowns for three kilometres, although then he claimed that it was a sum of 56 crowns (he used a decimal - line trick).
He had a receipt, the cops came in, and this cab driver was so cutely bold, he was still going to see those cops and he asked them when somebody finally gave him the 56 crowns.
It's a similar case.
The taxi driver on the taxi took over the tenth line and stole 357 crowns from the tourists.
Can it be said that even after you showed the faces of those who were charging inconvenient amounts for a short drive, did the impossibility of fraudulent taxi drivers fail?
Their audacity is still incredible.
How'd it go with that cab driver doing the 56 crowns?
The officers sent him away with the fact that they can't discuss him on the spot because he issued a bill.
And that, I think, will be a problem in this court too (six taxi drivers and one ex-officer).
On the one hand, there'll be a cab driver with his bills on the other side of the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the master may not use the secret tapes from the taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I filmed the works about their fraud, the cabbies themselves warned me about this precedent.
I've always wanted to use it in the report.
Are you concerned that this fact could protect them even before a court of law?
I hope that every judge understands that no cab driver could drive for six or ten crowns a mile, because he wouldn't be able to feed himself.
You were talking about a ten-point trick, which, in particular, in front of foreign clients, the underwater taxi drivers are moving.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they worried about this thing after your newscasts are published?
I think we've popularized this trick by sending out the show.
I went with a cab driver recently, bragged to me that he was the honest cab driver.
But then I noticed that a black cloth was glued to the side of the cabometer.
When I asked him what he had there, he said, "You know what it is."
When punishments were not too effective for a taxi driver, can a court with their colleagues be a warning to them?
Is there anything that can keep them from cheating?
You've talked about how you think they'll find a way to cheat.
I don't think there's anything to discourage them.
But someone can squeeze them out of those places.
And these are the fair cab drivers who should fight more for getting them out of there.
From my experience, I must say that these fair cab drivers in Prague are fortunately superior.
But do they desire to go against those who corrupt their reputation as ministers?
They taste good, but they're missing their mind.
He can't walk around too much, and he can't say exactly what they want.
When they staged the demonstration (because of the proposal for a general restriction from the office of the primacy of Adriana Krnáčová), it did not sound very clear what they wanted.
Once they said that they were not protesting against Uber, that they just wanted to have the same conditions as my own service, then they claimed they wanted more than Uber.
It happened that they just blocked Prague and it only created the best possible ad for Uber.
How do you generally evaluate the access of the Prague Magistrate to solving the problem of forewarning the horse?
It's obvious that she had to go to the crime police to solve something.
The magistrate was short on that.
They had a mole who was leaking information, which means that the taxi department was doing their job for a few years completely unnecessary.
I hope they're charging this clerk with all the sleepy checks in the last check to make him realize what he's done.
That's the worst thing I can do.
I was even on a test drive with him, which I learned from their schedule.
It's been months since the last parts of the show were published.
What's the response?
I mean, mainly for foreign viewers, which is actually the most focused series.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I let them have the videos.
And when we walk around the Old Town Square, they're surprised that the same people that are seen on the footage are really standing.
Infamous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd build a wire around them to make people look at them.
A museum of communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a cab if you need one?
Sure.
I ride with services that I don't have to pay in cash, but with a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many disciplines that are fair.
I only took a cab once on the street.
The driver said to me after he got in the car, "Well, you've got courage."
I'll be in disguise for an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were mentioned in 2005.
The former prime minister, Pavel Bém, went on a check-up tour for an Italian tourist in the same year and was wronged by his driver by two hundred at his first attempt.
But Editor Rubesh has had worse experience.
The taxi drivers charged him for a ride from Old Town to Václav Square 820 crowns, which is about 195 crowns per km, as reported by reporters.
The Prague Magistrate set a maximum price of 28 crowns per kilometre.
Other surprising sums are also recorded: for example, a two-mile trip from Paris to Truhlarska was a tourist’s 400 crown.
Dear rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at Karl's Bridge.
They charge about six hundred crowns for their journey to the Angel, which is two and a half miles [2,5 km].
The marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and longer the better.
Its impurities go well, although sometimes dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it has to be removed from the folds.
It's not easy and it's not fast, she approached her work as a restorer, Vanessa Trostová, from Oldrich, in Hajj.
The hat down before it: the tomb is fitted with a scaffolding, after which it is necessary to climb out and climb again.
"The restaurator should be careful, patient and inconvenient in the working environment," she said.
It's not the first restoration work she's ever done in Frydlansk.
As a result of the restoration, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the back tract of the Freedlant Town Hall, also restored statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Zatiší, St. John Nepomucké in Frýdlanta, Piet in Fridlant District Street, Marian Column in Frydlant, or atlanta in the front of the spa in New Town under Smrk.
With the renewal of Melchior's tomb, Kryštof and Kateřina from Redern, it began in Frydlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned from the application of impurities and cross, the loose stone parts are secured against fall and shift; either they fall into the wall or into each other.
They will also be treated and preserved.
The inscriptions on the tomb are going to get cold again.
"Then it will begin by ironing the inscriptions on marble boards with fine linen gold," said the State Monumental Care of the City Office in Frydlant Véra Sobotová.
There's no record of a tomb passing through any repairs from the past.
At a closer look, they'll take the holes drilled in marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old and they're leftovers after the tombstone decorations.
He was richly decorated, unfortunately, after the Swedish invasion of the Thirty Years' War, everything disappeared.
They literally hung a tombstone, marked Sobot.
In the Church of the Holy Cross are restaurants with a slight oversupply as at home.
After the Flood in 2010, it was necessary to put in order tombs that were found underwater, a baptismal room, wall paintings in the tomb and now a tomb.
"We would also like to go into the windshield in the future," Saturday said.
The church is otherwise in a very good condition, every year to maintain and repair the money.
Restaurant work on the restoration of a redernovation tomb will come to a total of 128 thousand crowns.
They will be covered by grants, the city will not invest any of its money in this part of the reconstruction.
A hundred thousand crowns will come from the victory in the regional round of the historic city competition 2015, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, said Mayor Frýdlant Dan Ramzer.
The agency decided to release the prize for the restoration of the tombstone.
Opinions of experts on future developments in selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) in the course of one month and a half.
Low volatility and growth prevail in markets.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The US S&P500 index, which went through 12% of today's corrections in February, is at a new historical maximum and has been writing down 7% since the beginning of the year.
Once again, the iron rule is confirmed that traders should never, for a long time, go against the interests of central banks, which have finally reached their own.
In a situation where U.S. stock at the historical maximum is thus again disappearing, the volatility that is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets have grown well and fearlessly due to the quantitative release of the US Central Bank and when, like today, the volatility index (VIX) has remained stable below the 12 per cent limit.
And don't.
Although the Fed continues to prepare the markets for a gradual increase in interest rates, the quantitative release in Europe and Japan has been fully flowing and has added a hand last week to the work of Bank of England, which will buy bonds in the next six months of £70 billion.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative release pushes low returns even lower and contributes to almost complete elimination of risk and fear from the future.
How long will this state last?
Of course, it's a million-dollar question.
But there are currently no risks, the world economy is undergoing almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation on the commodity market, and China is stabilizing and brooking is no longer essentially a topic, so we should not be too surprised if US shares continue in a similar calm regime.
Too bad Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted this difficult work of experienced policy, said European Commission chief Juncker, when French policy (really experienced, because it was hit by so many different transnational political functions that a better example of so-called European elites would be difficult to look for) appointed the main negotiator of the European Commission for the conditions of departure of Great Britain from the EU.
Juncker's choice has led to signs that it is in the EU's serious interest to seek out the forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most British media accepted Barnier's name as Juncker's war act.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
Great Britain hates.
As Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was responsible for reforming European banking law.
He adopted it as only he could: the entrenched enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and the model of capitalism.
The representatives of multilateral regulations were co-author of the concept of the so-called banking union, and with regard to all that comes from the London Financial Centre City, they imposed legislation on the overly tight regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, a representative of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a tough, unbreakable and apparently reckless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
How to remember in this context the peaceful and friendly distribution of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance, overview and ability of the empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
And that is why Czechs with Slovaks can be the closest friends and allies today.
Too bad Juncker didn't learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this one.
It would be good for everyone!
Earthquake around Putin?
The ruler of the Kremlin has released his loved one, Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin released Sergei Ivanov from office on Friday.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajna.
She informed the Russian media about this with an appeal to the Kremlin press service notice.
Putin indicated that Ivanova was releasing at his own request.
During a meeting broadcast by Rossia 24, the president said he was going to grant Ivan's wish to take up office as head of the President's office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the exchange of the President's administration, which Ivanov's current representative Vajno will now lead, is considered rather surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is named one of Putin’s closest associates.
This former KGB officer in the past, for example, has served as Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister.
He will now leave the chair of a member of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov, in his meeting with Putin, said that the duration of his stay was actually the record of the Head of State's administration.
He lasted four years and eight months in it.
In this context, he recalled that 11 people had already been replaced in this function 25 years after its establishment.
Kwitt or the doppelganger uncle won't play the Shafar finals.
So far, not one of the Friday tennis games has been able to turn into a final match.
As her first battle, she lost Peter Kvit, who succumbed to Monica Puig's Puerto Rican surprise after set 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, Kwitová was followed by Czech deboss Shafarivová and Uncle.
The Williams sisters’ slayers, although in the first set they reached after winning, lost two matches, and Russia eventually took advantage of the set in the short game.
The second set then lost a ratio of 4:6.
Half the success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: skier Ondřej Synek with an overview won his semifinals when the second Damira Martin from Croatia defeated despite the release at the end of almost a second.
Today was good, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, said Sinek.
It was his rivals who had to fight for the process, unlike him.
So it took some power away from them, that could be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's gonna be easy, it's just playing cards, the Dukly of Prague said.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková did not walk in Snyk's footsteps.
The 15-year-old rower took fourth position in today's semifinals, and on Saturday, she is due to start in the B final and fight for 7 to 12th place.
Gold from London doesn't fight like that.
For the first time in the Olympics, I didn't go to the finals.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I ran a high-quality race, and I put everything I could into it.
The rivals were just better, Topinque Knappk bent down before them.
She fought until the end and believed that she would get into the four games between the elite sixes.
She gave up the fight right in front of the target.
I knew the girls were balanced that anyone could get out of that field.
I'm surprised the Chinese woman had such a finish.
And I thought I could go to the finals through Racustrap.
Unfortunately, today she went to a life race, told the world champion in 2011.
Far beyond the final gates of Rio remains young shooter Filip Neejchal, who has not managed to break his skills this time in bed.
In it Neejchal occupied 33rd place.
The qualifications were the best for the Russians.
From the first stop Sergey Kamenski with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Neejchal's shot was 62.5 points.
Athletes also spoke to the program in Rio for the first time, including Czech seven-fighter Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Kachová belongs to the second discipline of the Olympic competition 11th place, Czech record holder Eliška Klučinová is a twenty-first.
Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to an altitude of 198 centimeters, as did Belgium's second female Nafissato Thiam.
Both took care of historically the best performance in the 7th.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but they didn't make it.
German, Russian, who's worse?
When we look back on the absurdity of the question: Germany has gone through a deep seberflex, where Russia is not.
In the 20th century, dictators came into existence in both the great Eurisian nations, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal, and horrendous came to power.
Russian Bolsheviks contributed largely to 94 million victims of communism from 1917 to 1989, as reported by the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent warfare or inhuman experiments.
In a inhuman way, the Nazis wiped out about 6 million Jews, and the total sacrifice of World War II is estimated at 60 million.
The Germans and the Soviets committed atrocities in occupied or abandoned territories.
In Germany and in the USSR, it was not only a few individuals, but a large part of the nation participated actively, passively or merely in cowardice or instigation in the sand.
This is not just a specificity of these nations, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany immediately the end of the war came the denunciation, the Nuremberg tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they started asking, "Daddy, Grandpa, why did you participate in such atrocities?"
How could you!
This has brought real reflection and healing to society.
Germany's elites have recently taken care of the prosperity of the country, the removal of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly don't want to rejoin Alsasko-Lotrinska or anyone - to rematch - military attack - that everyone will recognize.
After the lost Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes definitely closed at the turn of the millenniums when the former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimír Putin came to power.
Often a criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putinovska Russia is to rematch, gain lost territories, humiliate the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of one’s own people are of no value to the vertigo.
Beat yours, and the strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only those decades of despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from rising tension around Crimea?
Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation at the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea area has deteriorated.
Who is benefiting from the increase in tension?
After a longer period of relative peace, there has been another deterioration in relations between Ukraine and Russia.
The replacement of the Ukrainian side became the Crimea peninsula, which was connected more than 2 years ago to Russia and is part of its territory.
Of course, reports from both sides contradict each other and are difficult to verify independently, and so we have the opportunity only to think of an old known question to whom does this benefit?
According to reports from Moscow there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and on the contrary accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
Information on the arrest of members of Ukrainian special forces in the territory of Russia has already come from the case of Savchenkova known reply that they were allegedly abducted in the territory of Russia.
If we joined the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
A simple answer is nothing.
The escalation of tension around Crimea can only damage Russia, mainly by the West in the form of further approval of sanctions and strengthening of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, the immigration crisis in Europe has led to a shift away from the situation in Ukraine.
Ukrainian leadership has already lost all credit to its people, with the current support of President Poroshenko moving about 15%.
Ukraine's economy would long ago have bankrupted itself from being generous financial injections by the EU and, above all, the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to draw close to its country once again to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation before voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the power components want to show up again as powerful men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
It is not simply to hope that all those who are trying to open up an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their huge responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but all ordinary people on both sides and stop their hostile actions.
Bulgaria First Inflation in Eight Months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate was 1% in Bulgaria in July.
This is the highest value for several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October of last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0,2 % has been published.
The annual average inflation rate measured by the CPI index over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101,0 %, so monthly inflation was 1,0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2 % and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2 %.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in the travel of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Price decreases occurred in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as the previous month, prices remained for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
U.S. Secret Service has been tracking hacking Russian attacks for a year.
Information on Russian attacks came to the public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was engaged in an attack on the servers of the party headquarters of Democrats.
But the Russian stake in the attack is not mentioned in any official report.
Moscow denied the share of the attack.
The report on the monitoring of the alleged Russian attack was top secret because it would reveal that US secret services are monitoring and revealing the way they are doing it and the sources they use.
Two Russian intelligence services were said to have been involved in the attack.
A New Advisory Board for Cybersecurity
The Russian trace tracking material was encrypted and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Of the public figures, only a small group of eight leaders of the Congress, known in the United States as the Eighth Gang, was informed.
It is created by the Chiefs of both Chambers, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the Presidents of Democrats in both the Chambers of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and four members of the Defence and Security Committees of Congress.
On Thursday, Democratic Party chief Donna Brazil announced that she was creating a cybersecurity advisory board to "prevent future attacks and ensure the first-class protection of the Democratic Party's servers".
There was a dangerous parasite in the smoked salmon of Albert.
The string apologized.
On the basis of the consumer's call for health problems following food consumption Losos wild smoked - pieces 100 g, the date of consumption 22.11.2016 was checked by Prague hygiene in Albert stores on Václav Square and Na Mostka.
The inspection found that the lot of L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, to which the customer had already indicated that it was no longer available, and therefore the product of the same batch with the date of consumption was collected 11.12.2016.
The laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis complex.
It's a parasitic worm in the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for a person - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen and a man seen living larvae can penetrate through the gastric wall into the internal organs, said Stich.
Customers are very sorry for the problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the mentioned batch from the sale and for preventive reasons we also withdrew all other batches of this item.
The supplier we were dealing with had doubts, and at the same time we had this product tested, she told the newspaper spokesman Alberto Barbor Vanko.
If the customer has bought this product, in any of the stores he can return it chained and get the money back.
The larvae will destroy the frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vrňata.
The health authorities informed Prague and Central Bohemian Veterinary Administration of the occurrence of the dangerous product.
According to the food safety server.cz after the appearance of the parasite, people may have an anisakiosis, which is manifested by severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and nausea, or the disease may occur without a sign, the Czech Republic said.
Symptoms will be delivered one hour to two weeks after consumption of poorly heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the beginning, larvae will usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, so they are killed either by sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or by freezing it.
The veterinarians have currently checked the salmon for imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples tested had parasites in them.
The shipment of 1,700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Expelled, in the vast majority of the Ahold chain, was 919 packages to date.
Currently there is a download of the unsold stock of the product from the shops, SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal said on Friday.
Veterinarians prohibited the dispatch of other products from storage immediately after finding positive samples.
Seventeen-year-old Brita wanted to escape from Rakka, apparently killed by a Russian raid.
After the initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage to the jihadist who was killed in the process, sobering came.
The expected paradise of Caliphate turned for British girls into hell on earth, not from which there was no escape.
The girl was according to relatives in contact with her sister Halima.
She called her again in Britain and told her she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have orders to shoot without purpose, quotes The Telegraph lawyer of the deceased girl's family Tasnima Akunje.
The last clues led to Rakka, the last time the girl heard from there.
Then all that was left was a message about her death, which could not be verified.
Her family was communicating with her from an apartment in East London.
Together, they discussed how it could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
There they hoped to meet their former student again.
But Cadiz was probably killed before she could escape because the house where she stayed was compared to the country in May, the British ITV News reported.
Television added that the bomb apparently dropped a Russian aircraft that attacked the IS garden in Syria.
You would take the blue out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, the family's lawyer.
During the week when (Kadiza) was thinking about fleeing the Islamic State, a Racustak woman was caught trying to escape and was publicly killed to death, according to available information.
I think that (Kadiza) put it as a warning and decided not to take any chances, according to the BBC Akunjee.
Family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlanaová and 15-year-old friends from Shamimou Begum School and Amir Abas took a trip on February 17th last year.
The only thing they said at home was that they were coming out.
However, they headed for Gatwick Airport and from there through Turkey to the territory controlled by IS.
According to the lawyer, the girl's family did everything they could to get Cadiz back.
You would take the blue out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, and this family did everything they could, to get her daughter home.
But it was not possible without the risk of being caught, the lawyer added.
The only positive thing he believes is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a deterrent to other girls or boys who are allowed to fool themselves with Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases where people went there, realized how things were going there, understood how far it was different from the promises of the propaganda of the Islamic State, and wanted to return," Akunjee further said.
The fate of Kadiz's classmates is unknown.
However, since they also remained silent, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For centuries, the municipality of Inveray was the county centre and headquarters of the Duke of Argyl.
Since the middle of the 18th century, courts have been held at the town hall, and the basement under the hall has served as a local prison.
The conditions under which the convicts remained were sad and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them have been successful.
Therefore, the city representatives decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to the prisoners, with heating and gas lighting.
However, it had not been in operation for a long time, it was closed for economic reasons at the end of August 1889, as smaller repair facilities were expensive for operation and did not pay too much.
Ghostbusters' stories and ghost hunts.
For the public, the prison opened centuries later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see how different conditions prevailed.
Guides in time costumes still strengthen authentic experience.
It is also a torture room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment have been applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked in one of the cells, mostly because of a photo on the monument, or to guide the feeling that prisoners are experiencing behind bars.
Besides, the Inveray Prison is one of the most famous Scottish sites, where it reportedly fears.
Several groups of hunters of paranormal activities have appeared there, and to this day the museum allows people to come hunting spirits.
That night, however, will come up to £300, which is roughly CZK 9,500.
Apart from this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramic and history.
“Animal” effect on Snapchat is criticised as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat application allows about 150 million users to change reality and to mess with the identity of ways that border on absurdity.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog or a figure that seems to come out of Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies each day.
Any error will immediately be made public.
Snapchat filters in the past have served to criticise that the app promotes blackfacing or that it supports white skin shades as the ideal of beauty.
So when this week users were offered a filter that allowed them to have sharp eyes, curved teeth and puffed faces, some critics called it the racist cartoon of the Asians - "yellowface."
And they asked whether these repeated issues pointed to the larger problem of society - the problem of diversification.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about this, and the news and anger spread rapidly, and Snapchat immediately the next day stated that the function had been cancelled.
The company offered an explanation: Filter was intended to show the accounts to figures of the anime, not as a cartoon of the Asians.
But the viewers who witnessed racism, the filter pointed to painful stereotypes in action.
Others with no packaging refused comparison with the anime.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student in Korea whose tweet about photography was widely shared, said in an e-mail that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing.”
She added that “it’s hard to argue against comparing obvious Asian cartoons and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is dragged into the contemptuous extreme.
Snapchat is not the only society that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
America's culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversion and inclusion, from meeting halls in corporations to hollywood and equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that you can expect even more sensitivity.
"When one Snapchat filter creates a picture that is offensive to a user," said five-twenty-seven Katie Zhuová on Thursday in the interview, "it is very difficult for these things to happen today without notice as they were before."
Katie Zhuová, a product manager and designer who works for the Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and invite others to do the same.
In her article on Media and on the phone, she stated that she was convinced that racially motivated problems reflected the lack of diversity in the recruitment of employees in Snapchat.
Katie Zhuová criticized the vast white, entirely male leadership of the company and the article ended with hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that there is no diversion between employees and colorful people at the moment when these things are decided," said Zhuová, who has Chinese-American origin, "or bare people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to talk."
Other observers share her opinion - the complaint Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not disclose the figures relating to the diversity of its employees by having the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of his employees, but according to the spokesman, the company recently accepted a recruiter who should focus on the underrepresented population and internal inclusion management.
Zhuová adds: “I’m curious if they really need other such users who can say that it’s not right” with the fact that their account will be cancelled.
Military officers draw up intelligence on IS, says Parliamentary Committee
The Parliamentary Committee reported in a report on Thursday that officials from the United States Central Command were exchanging intelligence reports to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events from the country.
According to a preliminary report from the working group drawn up by the Republican Chairman of the Committee on Armed Forces, the Committee on the Intelligence Services and the Defence Subcommittee, a “extensive dissatisfaction” was found among the analysts of the Central Intelligence Service, according to which their superiors changed their assessment of the American effort to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release states: “The results of the intelligence secret services approved by the superior officers of Centcom tended to offer a more positive picture of the US anti-terrorist efforts than were confirmed by the facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the reporting community.”
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when a false analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Ken Calvert, a congressman and a republican from California.
The failure in the management of Centcom reaches the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the continuing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analysing US efforts in training Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no decisive evidence that Obama's top management representatives ordered the reports to be amended, it is reported that analysts had the impression that the leaders of Centcom were under pressure to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Staff press reports, statements and statements from Congress were significantly more positive than what events actually were," the report said.
For example, the representative of Centcom announced publicly that a major military attack on Mosul could start in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is clear after months of investigation," said Member Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Republican party from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, US Central Staff intelligence staff have manipulated the highest position with the output of headquarters intelligence services in order to reduce the risk of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans formed a working group after learning about the concerns of analysts that information from intelligence services concerning the Islamic State is being manipulated.
After a report published on Thursday, a more detailed examination shall follow the investigation.
Further investigations by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defence are under way in the Centcom intelligence services.
The democratic members of the Committee on Intelligence published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the working group of Republicans.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom has created a very close process for compiling an evaluation of information on IS and Iraqi security components," said representative Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and representative of Democrats in the statement.
According to Adam Schiff, the process “has led to a distortion of the output of the intelligence services,” damaged morals between analysts and “inadequately taken into account disagreeable views.”
However, Schiff and the Democrats argue that they have found no evidence that the White House would try to pressure the analysts of Centcom to adjust their findings according to “proposals or political situations. ”
Preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by a general inspector of the Pentagon, which was launched following the complaints of analysts from Centcom.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, spokesman for the Pentagon, stated in his statement that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the parliamentary report because the investigation of the Inspector General is still ongoing.
However, he stated that "the councillors sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these fundamental issues of national security."
The investigation has an impact on the question of whether Americans being bombed in Iraq and Syria are successful (the result that now declares an increasing number of defence representatives).
However, last year's indictment raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to honestly evaluate military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis sites.
The criticism of reporting on the Islamic State has reflected conflicts for more than ten years, when an analyst of news services at Centcom Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that President George W. Bush's administration - despite the objections of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the intelligence services of the Islamic State.
Last year, authorities announced that Hooker's team concluded that despite a public statement of the opposite, air strikes against the refineries of the Islamic State did not significantly weaken the financial resources of this terrorist group, as the group built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings were not transmitted outside the Central Staff.
Commander of Centcomu, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subjected to the criticism of the past year after many legislators found the Senate's testimony too positive by the assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at Centcom.
The United States won the 4th game on the ground hockey game in a row, so today there will be a decisive match on the team of the United Kingdom
Katie Bam in the match against Japan, which ended with a 6-1 victory, scored three goals and only a day later for an American women's hockey team scored the first two goal matches, in which America defeated India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two games are good to remember, but Bam said she wasn't sure if she had ever done anything like that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I don't belong to those who write down their goals.
But this is what he knows: Americans at the Olympic tournament lead to 4-0 games, and they share the first place in the group with Great Britain, which remained on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0 remained undefeated.
Great Britain and the United States meet on Saturday in the last round of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals and the match will decide which of the six teams ends in the first and second place.
The team in the first place is a little longer to avoid the powerful Danes who are at the head of the second group.
No matter what the Saturday game ends, the Americans here caused their surprise ride four years after they ended up with 12 teams playing games in London.
Bam was on that team, too.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and she took hockey for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at all.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she didn't get to the finals.
Then came 2012 when neither she nor her team members were very successful.
The following year, a coach was appointed by Englishman Craig Parnham and things began to change.
“Cultural change, mental change, physical change,” said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the tempo we have today.
We've made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam began in the first half by firing the goal with a close-up Beckendem.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and maintained score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter when Bamová took advantage of the opportunity.
She ran off on the left side of the playing field, then she clicked on the Wednesday and shot the ball into the goalie to get the American girls to lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal at half-fourth quarter.
Disposal of the American goalie, Jackie Briggs, who in each of the three victories helped to one goal, was the first ever in the tournament.
He's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"Now we are in a good place," said Parnham, but as good as it is, it will depend on the result of Saturday's game.
Zen trampoline in the middle of Olympic rage
No matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's the Olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro it is to feel persistent, indescribable and busy changing competition and effort.
It's how the Olympic torch itself would be a hot battle that's been passed on from a swinger swimmer, gymnast and triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the front of the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Billes, Katie Ledecky or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the coming mistress of women with lowlife faces, is on the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names are heard in households in the main broadcast time between advertising and spot sponsors if he is a swimmer, gymnast or even a shermist.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California, fights for Olympic gold in trampoline jumps.
The Olympic fire doesn't shine on all the competitions the same.
Away from the center, a little in the shade are sports that are not generally recognized: shooting from air pistols, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always be successful in the classic swim style - and will probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my special favorite, let me point out the subtle charm of trampoline.
Although jumping on the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first introduced to the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention this sport remains almost without notice - many of the people I asked did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The US never won a medal in jumping on trampoline, and by 2012 none of the athletes had even made it to the finals.
Prices in the male category usually divide between China and Russia and the female category between China and Canada.
This year, the London gold medals will cover Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But trampoline jumps have another bad luck, partly because the unsacrifice's ear seems to be more suitable for clown university than for the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just an amateur watching the country.
It has a comical potential - comical vibration of endless reflection - but also the smoothness of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combines.
The word “trampolin ” is derived from the Spanish“ el trampoline ” meaning “Skokan plate. ”
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to a height of about 10 meters and displays a set of elements (salts, turns and combinations) before they finally land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to implementation, difficulty and “times in the air”.
Twenty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is ahead.
The gold medal fighters must move on, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
They are trying to catch up not only on the finish line or on the starting wall, but, as TV news reports say, another imaginary line: the world record or the Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, somewhat fanatical - and sufficient to bring spectators to tears.
But I think it's also somewhat exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Jumping on trampoline in this respect brings relief.
The track of an athlete on a trampoline is upwards.
Meaning is not moving forward.
He or she reflects as if they were in a state without weight as astronauts, flying up, then down, and then up again without effort.
Without competition and, of course, no difficulty can be achieved, but during the duration of the composition, there is no fierce struggle to achieve the goal, no measuring distance, but only perfect, smooth stretching of time and gravity.
This is just as close as the Olympics and Zen get near.
The qualifications and finals of women take place on Friday afternoon, at 13 East Time, men's competitions then on Saturday at the same time.
NBC station will broadcast the finals within the afternoon block, starting after both days at 14 hours.
In the middle of the Olympic madness, they promise peaceful, pleasant moments that you will probably overlook through the rest of the battles.
And if attention is to be given only to men's athletes being the object of their loving views and weight gain - as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to catch their breath.
“Protesting Generations” in Ethiopia, U.S. longtime ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia have encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses claim that many protestors were shot during the clashes with the police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, the country has been plagued by anti-government unrest, which is spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have gone into the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's reaction was merciless.
Witnesses claim that the police shot and killed members of unarmed demonstrators.
On rolling video recordings of protests likely coming from the end of last year or early this year, members of the security forces are caught beating young people with sticks after being forced to stand on the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now asking for a thorough examination.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and take a step forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, Project Manager of Horn of Africa for the International Crisis Group Research Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
US military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to address the dangers of terrorist attacks in the area, particularly in Somalia, and few from African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - even the new suburban train is in the capital city of Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - an organization fighting for human rights without ceasing to talk about government repression - opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were evicted, imprisoned, killed, or evicted far into the desert.
But that can change.
"When people are strangled and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breakthrough," said Seyoum Teshome, who is teaching at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all youth.
He's been protesting for generations.
The problem is many and it concerns everything about land disputes after the absolute control of the ruling coalition.
After last year's elections, which have been widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies have won the last chair held by the opposition and now controls 100 per cent in Parliament.
At the same time the pressure on the border with Eritrea is increasing. The conflict along this vaguely marked, disputed border demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Anylics fear that Separatist groups, which have been more or less oppressed over the past years, such as the Oromsky Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may attempt to exploit confusion and re-arm arms.
There are several factors that explain why now after years of smothering under the surface, these bitter feelings rekindled.
The first is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social networks for up to the last few years, when they have become commonly available cheaper smartphones and the provision of Internet services has improved.
And even though the government prohibits access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually the case during protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxys that hide the position of these people.
Several young Ethiopians talked about how they gathered for the protests.
There is also greater solidarity between Oroms and Amhars, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and the Amhars are not natural allies.
After a long time, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian tops of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and commerce and used Oroms, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that changes, too.
"We are on our way to united leadership," said Mulata Gemech, leader of Oromo.
The biggest protests occurred in the areas inhabited by Amhara and Oromy.
Many Amhars and Oromos believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of Tigray's ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and controls the army, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the death of Meles Zenavi.
Zenavi, a former rebel leader, was the Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to unspecified diseases.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see as a corner.
Analysts say that he was particularly master at detecting the initial signs of dissatisfaction and using envoys to process and win opponents.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was removed from relative ignorance in order to replace Zenavio.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigris region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam came from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security service of the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be further bloodshed.
Ethiopia last experienced such unrest in 2005 after thousands of people protested what analysts described as elections that the government had robbed and then stole.
A hard attack followed, during which many protestors were killed - even though less than in the past months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts commended Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new suburban train and measurable progress in combating poverty.
However, it is quite obvious that the gradual rise in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop it.
And there's dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protestors in Gondar's Amharic city attacked companies owned by Tigreians, and protests against Tigers on social networks have become more common.
Analysts say that protests put the US and other Western allies in an awkward situation.
The U.S. government uses Ethiopia as a base for drone crossings over neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently declared that the base was closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, at the same time it does not want its ally to disintegrate in an already volatile area.
"That," Abdi said, "is a very sharp edge sharp."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and funding IS as “sarkasmus”
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to embody the latest controversy that flooded his campaign, stating that he did not mean it when he insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founders of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican candidate to speak clearly with the American public.
He also puts his constituencies in an awkward situation, who have worked hard to defend him in times of distress, and he has to explain that he may not have taken his comments seriously.
Following this proposal for Wednesday night's meeting, Trump confirmed Thursday's statement and insisted in talks that he did not really intend to say that President and H. Clinton's IS had been created.
However, in a post on Twitter Friday morning Trump declared that he was only being sarcastic.
The paper was the opposite of claiming the old just one day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump ease his note by recalling Obama's efforts to destroy the IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes at a time when Trump tried to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preferences in election surveys decline.
Trump and Clinton participated in the Michigan duel this week on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
On Twitter again, he warned that Clinton's proposals were linked to an increase in taxes, and said that according to her speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm defense earlier.
At the end of July, when he cleaned up a wave of criticism when he proposed that the Russians should penetrate Clinton's e-mails, he would explain his remark later by saying, "I am, of course, sarcastic."
This approach allows Trump to push the limits of political statements and to ease them as necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing to the extent that some reports have a response to his supporters to find out how they react and, according to the reaction, one way or the other, ‘substantial explanation’ said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who followed the language used by both candidates.
But I also think that he is averse in his statements, and he knows that they are sufficiently hesitant to be explained differently.
As the results of the election surveys continue to decline in its favor, Trump has chosen an even more divisive tone in recent days, instead of making things easier for the general electorate.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, which was published on Friday, showed that Thump is far behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very closely behind her in Florida.
Trump is even trying to avoid apologizing for the provocative remarks he says, but often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But along with Trump’s increased attention during the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes brought an unpleasant situation to his dedicated followers, who must be publicly behind him, no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former New York Mayor, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate Thursday in a CNN interview.
"I believe what he says is a legitimate political comment," said Giuliani, when he was asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That's true in the sense that in front of Obama there was an almost unknown I.S., a small organization that he misrepresented as a novice, and it was because he withdrew his army from Iraq.
Most ordinary republicans try to argue that the Obama government, in which Clinton acted as foreign minister, has allowed IS to be and not be able to handle the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued on Twitter to breathe fire at media for reshaping every word of his word and being biased against him.
He laughed at the “poor, pathetic” TV students who tried to understand him and said,“ They can’t do it! ”
Several Democrats have been offended by Trump's apology by the fact that it is just another proof that he is not eligible for the Presidential Office.
The coffee shop is being squeezed out of the price market. Now it's returning to Greenpoint.
The Verb Cafe cafe was a tricky place in Williamsburg where you could pay only cash without Wi-Fi, but where coffee has been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the front of the Bedford Avenue house.
Soap Cherie - a trade that Verb replaced in summer 2014 - sells soaps in the form of cakes.
Locals mourned as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea’s hotel is burned, and Verb is now a soap shop. ”
But if New York is a change, then it's another revelation.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
New Verb has wi-fi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee's still good, too.
The manager of the new Verbu is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original coffee shop, who is also the owner and CEO of the new place.
In Verb began in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of his customers offered to pay him to move to a new place, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb has still the same cooker and bought the same model machine for espresso.
He even used the old Verba lighting again.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
The offer includes ham, egg and cheese sandwiches and toppings such as sugars and fried onions.
You'll also find a bowl of brown rice.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but it will offer you fresh fruit juice.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed the constant influx of original regulars.
"A lot of original customers from Williamsburg also had to move out for prices," he said.
There was one of those customers here last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to Verb Cafe often.
She came even after the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed up, she totally stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found that what I like is coffee and culture in Verba," she said.
Now he drinks coffee again, but on that day, instead of his usual iced coffee, she gave mixed chai, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been loyal to Verbe since 2003.
He goes to work and orders the same thing all the time.
"In the quarter and eight here every day, as the watch, I will come, and they are preparing for me my goose with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the offer.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he normally does, but sometimes he gets bacon, eggs and ham on his goose with everything.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry that the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
Traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also accepted the cafe well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to put it soon to make his new neighbors feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
Local fruit juice manufacturer wants to go to the bottle and sell filtered coffee.
The possibility is offered to extend the coffee shop to the next building.
A lot of customers are just getting their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the coffee shop reopened, coming in and having coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressive food from the crisis - in “Square Meal”
Shortly after joining the President's office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
President Roosevelt’s laundress enjoyed the selected foods from 5th Avenue, such as a duck from geese livers and mariland turtle soup.
Its menu on this day was more modest: Eggs of the devil's way in Paradise sauce, potato mash and as dessert plum pudding.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat. ”
A couple who live in Brooklyn Heights are dedicated to gastronomic history.
The last book by Andrew Coe “Coop Suey” was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book “97 Orchard” tells the life story of a residential house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new "A Square Meal" joint work, published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of the American cuisine during the great economic crisis.
They themselves showed cooking solidarity and met with a reporter at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small, strict buffet in Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) had turkey, potato porridge and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a mass carbaña, which according to the couple was an excellent conversation about food during the crisis.
"The Carbanates were very popular," said Ms. Ziegelman.
It sold beet, liver and beans.
They were made of this yarn and other cheap food that the ingredients set up.
Remake the amount of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe's engaged.
"They would lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years leading up to the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet of snow that you eat.
Teams of women cooked for farm workers and for breakfast, lunch and dinner were served freshly baked pie.
They were Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "And Square Meal" monitors how the nation was coping with the fact that it was not a land of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe said in an explanation why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Similarly, the new budget diet was feared: mysterious foods, such as casseroles and casseroles, were spread as “a wonderful way to use the leftovers,” observed Ziegelman, since cooks could hide non-aesthetic ingredients under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat — after many years the central point of American food — has become a cost-effective luxury.
Strange blends that were supposed to serve as calorie and nutritional fillings had a preference over flavor or even common sense in cooking.
During the research on the recipe-containing book, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a daily meal of baked onion filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the evening table," said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman emphasized: “It was surreal. ”
Peanut butter with roasted onions doesn't fit together.
It was typical of a lot of homemade recipes.
As never before and never since, domestic economists - including Louise Stanley, the general federal office for the domestic economy between 1923 and 1943 - ran the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, inviting women to take over budget burdens, and the shish, such as carrot cream spaghetti, turned them into delicious foods.
The book “A Square Meal” is a celebration of historical myths.
Above all, snacks were created in the government's response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's pose "I'll have a pie".
While publicly praising the simple Jewish farm kitchen of his childhood, he served as the chosen millionaire he had become.
"The board ate continental cuisine such as fish with cucumber sauce," Andrew Coe said.
He was eating in an almost embroidered room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably make the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, did not force him to follow the example of his own stomach.
As the book says, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste at all, which led to the fact that the White House “not only served almost the most tiring food in all of Washington, but also the most inconsolable way prepared. ”
A number of eating habits from the times of the crisis resounded as soon as the country regained its feet.
The link remained in our constant examination of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
A couple say that during writing the book they better understood the eating habits of Miss Ziegelman's mother - perhaps why she couldn't throw away the food.
"She had real fear of wasting food," said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman recalled: “It was bad for people. ”
There's been an accident with the wreaths.
When Eisenberg had clean tables, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert that they prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It is called plum cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give humble recipes an elegant name.
There was no cream, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly cut a spoon into dense brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then one more time.
And as a proper householder, he said to his wife: “It would be a bit shaky. ”
Europeans: Migrants go for doses.
Most of the refugees falling into Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
That's how the show would look if we did it.
A group of Russian artists, called 2D Among Us, are making fun of their native country.
Using a photoshop, they create collages that funnyly show what it would look like if famous shows and movies were made in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of legal representation costs in the case of a patent against jaundice type C against Merck
The District Court Judge decided that Gilead Science Inc was entitled to pay the legal fees it had incurred in the case of a type C patent against Merck & Co Inc drug producer.
In June, the judgment was annulled, according to which Gilead was to pay $200 million for the damage caused by the violation of Merck’s two patents in connection with the very successful drugs of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the Federal Judge found repeatedly illegal proceedings on Merck’s part, in addition to other lies under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman told the file Thursday that Gilead is entitled to pardon the charges incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck tries to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the drug market for a new generation against jaundice type C, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case came from 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owner of the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead’s drugs.
US-backed military units claim to have gained full control of Manburg City
US-backed military units gained full control of the northern city of Manburg near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, the group spoke on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now sweeping the city after the rest of the radicals who have been hiding in the city.
The units freed over 2,000 civilians that the radicals detained, said Reuters Sharfan Darwish of the SDF Alliance and the Manbage Military Council.
"The place is now fully under our control, but we are still searching," Reuters said.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton published her tax returns on Friday for 2015, stating that the presidential candidate for Democrats and her husband had income of $10.75 million in the year, and that they had a real tax of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton paid $1 million to charity, mostly to Clinton Foundation.Exposed Bill Clinton contributed nearly $3.3 million to the joint cash register for lectures, and the former Foreign Minister admitted an income of $3 million from Simon & Schuster's book on his work at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's co-candidate, American Senator Tim Caine of Virginia, together with his wife, Anne Holton, published a tax confession in 10 years.
They paid a real tax of 20.3 percent in 2015.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Cain are still a model of financial transparency,” said Jennifer Palmieri in her statement, who helped the Clintons with the campaign.
Against this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws from his earlier promises that his tax returns will be made public.
It is the custom for U.S. President candidates to publish their tax returns, even though the law doesn't give them that.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers quoted the U.S. Ministry of Finance tax audit as a reason for his refusal of tax returns to be made public.
"Your move," said Hillary Clinton's campaign promoter on Twitter, and committed to a democratic candidate's tax return.
Michael Cohen, special advisor to Trump, said on Thursday CNN that he would not allow Trump's tax returns to be made public until the audits were completed.
According to Trump’s critics, including the 2012 President’s Republican candidate Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, his refusal raises questions about his net profits, contributions to charity, trade transactions and various other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton is a strong speaker and published a video on Friday, which reminds us of how high the status of the Republic of Trump insists on publishing its tax returns.
On Thursday, the question is mentioned in his speech on the economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all other candidates for the presidential office have done for decades - to publish their tax returns," she said in front of people.
Politico stated that Trump paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times publicist quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants who claim that this may be the case at the present time.
The rates of federal tax became a theme in the president's election.
Clinton enforces a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett, which would ensure that everyone who earns more than $1 million a year pays a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet at the Clinton Assembly in Omaza, Nebraska, where Buffet's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway sits, called Trump to meet and exchange tax confessions.
Buffett said he also passed the IRS audit and that Trump is not afraid of the financial authority but of voters.
The Clinton campaign published a tax return by 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average between 2007 and 2014, a 32 per cent federal tax and a combined tax of approximately 40,5 per cent.
Clinton's tax returns for 2015 show that unlike most Americans, they make only $100 in their wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which Clinton received dividends and interest rates of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chili or fireworks for the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from entering human dwellings - they throw condoms filled with chilli powder.
This process was also proven by Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea several years ago, along with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, this process promotes and educates volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, how by this non-violent process in four steps to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many of them used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is an elephant world day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they have developed this ... set of tools, we have seen a change in behavior in these communities. People believe much more that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said the executive director of the Honeyguide Damian Bell Foundation in a statement.
The first and second steps are to light the battery on the passing elephant and start the cloxone.
If he doesn't, he'll be thrown out of the so-called "chilli suit".
Chilli powder mixed with a firecracker will be wrapped in a condom, its end will become enraged so that only the knot will watch it.
After firing, the condom explodes and a mild chilli powder is dispersed into the air.
Most of the time, there's only one curtain and the elephant appears in the other direction.
The last option is to detonate the fireworks that causes a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director turned to the Berlin Hotel for removing the code for calling to Israel for the “request” of the Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin caused a stir in the media after finding that the Campinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling to Israel, according to an employee on the basis of the “demand” of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the documentary film on the Holocaust “Shoah”, ventilated his frustration from the Campinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel call code list.
However, the State was not listed among countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that Israel was removed and deleted in 2016 in Berlin, Germany’s capital?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Hotel Campinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation and had trouble turning to hotel reception.
Lanzmann’s answer was “shocked. ”
The hotel staff member replied that the measure had been “decided after respecting the management of Campinski Hotels”.
The reason for this move was even more encouraging to the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that Israel's calling code be deleted," Lanzmann quoted staff in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel’s ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman described the case as “a great disgrace”.
By chance, we were terrified and shocked.
In itself, it is a huge disgrace.
The fact that something like this has happened in Germany and in such a hotel chain is even more embarrassing.
There's no need for another explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event caused a strong online reaction, people branded it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel simply “lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
“Hannah to you,” says another paper, pointing out that the hotel, located on the noble street Kurfurstendamm, is located near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly held any charges by referring to the event as “review”, and Lanzman“ apologized. ”
“No direct order has ever been given” not to include Israel in the call code list, Suddeutsche Zeitung, a representative of the Kampinski Hotel, quotes.
He adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber missiles against protesting Brazilian students
The clash between students and police took place in Brazil's San Paula on Thursday, when students met at a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber missiles against protestors.
The problem arose when government law enforcement tried to disperse students, which ended with the police using rubber missiles and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration in order to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals proposed by the governor of the state of San Paulo Gerald Alckmin to save money is the closure of nearly a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were seen spraying signs against temporary President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the demonstrators marched to the streets to support President Dilmy Roussef, who decided to sue her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 % - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dhagaryan grew after the abolition of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran in an annual comparison of 70.9 percent.
As the Ambassador has stated, since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there has been an increase in the interest of Russian companies trading in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Another expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period for 2015 and reached $856 million.
Specifically, Russia’s exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The surge in trade has ensured delivery of hardware, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
In the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued approximately 35,000 visas, mostly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran has also first arrived among the top 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It is safe to say that the record number of tourists from Iran in Russia from last year will be exceeded," he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are well preserved," he said.
Scott Callum Skinner rushes home after the British won gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the hall of fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Rio fair, when the Trio team of VB defended the London 2012 title.
A three-year-old relative from Glasgow was in the role of the brake he took as his Scott Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man of the legend was pleased when he hit the finish line and stole the victory from the favored New Zealand.
Britain won surprisingly four years ago and Hoy won five of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after the modest sixth World Championship in March, even though Hoy ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for Jamie Staff's specialized introductory racer.
So Hindes showed up just in time.
After Hoye left, a place also opened up that he tried to fill out Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches, and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hinds - who was with Hoy champion four years ago - and Skinner reached the Olympic record in qualification, but the trick took over in New Zealand's first round.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hinds was slightly behind the wheel, but Kenny's team pushed forward and Skinner maintained the lead.
The change of strategy was a large part of transformation when Hinds went to a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy race was watching from his position as BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny, and Hinds went on stage, he didn't take his eyes off them.
Three - year - old Skinner, a relative from Glasgow, said: “It’s a flattering comparison. ”
I'm here to get the best out of myself and honor my name.
We've created an Olympic record in the finals, and we've beaten the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After the triumph next to Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012 Hinds admitted that he had fallen on the track after a weak start.
The remark was later withdrawn and British opponents had no opportunity to appeal.
This time, no such problem has occurred around this victory.
Hinds said, "With all the British flags on the stands, I felt like London."
In the last three months, we've all gone out as a team.
We've lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is supposed to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we will have a successful five - day tour.
With the form Kenny performed, it's not inconceivable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at one Olympics at the same time.
It would then be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, also has a birthday on March 23 (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, on this day also celebrates Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold and one silver medal.
Just as much as Hoy got.
As another one, Kenny will take part in the sprint that starts today, and it will take another three days.
An eight - year - old relative from Bolton said: “I enjoy this one now.
Team race is always the best.
You win along with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said: “When he wins another two gold medals, he should receive a knight’s title. ”
It was the only medal race of the day, but the British were expecting more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the four-mile race.
They're done with time 3:51,943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (2:42) take place on the second day of the race, which will certainly focus on Wiggins.
Yesterday before the qualifying race, he debated with the commissioners when the referees called him to measure his height.
In a similar women's race, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsel Shandová, Elinor Barkerová and Katie Archibald of Milngavia achieved world record 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on its strong track cycling team and controlled the middle period of the Olympic Games and gained a lot of medals.
After truly extraordinary performances, demonstrating absolute supremacy in Beijing and London, the expectation decreased during preparations for Rio.
Dramatic events unfolded on the background, last but not least, the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April for accusations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of a career of great men like Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, according to the first night of the race at the fair, it seems that the legendary reputation that the team of Great Britain can deliver the top performance with perfect timing could be reconfirmed.
Uncertain future of a tavern in Portland after termination of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminium mill in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant which the company supplies electricity and which informed about the intention of one of the owners of the factory to terminate the electricity supply contract. All contracts on electricity supply are expected to be cut.
This is after the Government of Victoria has decided earlier this year not to extend the grant that the company maintains.
The fixed 20-year grant expires in November.
Alcoa Portland may be at risk of up to 2000 jobs.
Up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be at risk during closure.
And since the tavern consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be further avalanches.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry factory in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglese power plant last year.
Alcoa Tavern in Portland is perennial and is in danger of being shut down.
This step follows several years of speculation about the future of the company, originally in response to a strong Australian dollar and recently due to prices for the production of the plant.
AGL, which supplies electricity from Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects that some of the other three owners will also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is Alcoa and Aluminum Joint Undertaking, small business shares are held by the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland race to continue, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the tavern will continue," she said.
AGL stated that the contracts are so-called ‘insurance contracts’ which were to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts shall have a 12-month notice period so that they will actually expire in 2017.
‘AGL continues to assume that the contracts will contribute to the profit for the fiscal year 2017’, the power plant declared.
Any possible impact on AGL profits since the fiscal year 2018 is currently limited due to the strong outlook of the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already written the value of contracts according to its accounting books of $187 million “in case the termination took place. ”
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract ‘has no effect on its ... ability to operate a tavern or secure the supply of electricity to the tavern’.
The US company stated that in 2010 it entered into a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years to start paying since November of this year, although it still had to explain why she had resigned from the contract.
Analysts are very careful as regards the possible closure of the Portland tavern in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
AGL traffic manager Stephen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago around 900 megawatts annually.
If both of these companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in market demand [electricity].
It would not be good for us as producers," he said.
Kendall is not only the real-life TV show of the Kardashians - now it is the cover of the glowing Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), a model and fourth daughter of the mother-managers of the Chris Kardashian-Jenner clan, appeared on the cover page of the September issue of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the ambassador to the brand Estee Lauder, who performed for the fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
“In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this cover," Kendall wrote.
The opening of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply continuing humorsky in Kardashian?) filmed video, in which the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (the Rob and Caitly Barbarians and together with them all the popular show business uncle, the producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) forgot their sister's cover, only so that the scene could end with a classic turn: they are preparing a secret party.
It is a covered history line of almost every “birthday” part of the children’s television show (Seacrest says: “Did you think that we had forgotten about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit on the show at eight o’clock in the morning), but Chris somehow needed to make sure that the other girls could live.
Because when we look at the glowing issue of Vogue magazine, we have certainly entered the new era of the Kardashians.
Senior Sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the headline of the September issue of the magazine is another league.
The September issue of Vogue magazine is the most sold number of the year.
The issue, which resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionist estimated that from 832 pages in last year’s edition there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The revelation of the star that appears on the front page is unexpectedly expected, so it is no wonder that in the past two years the pictures of the magazine have escaped before its official publication.
Among the women who appeared on the cover in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist or Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has certainly been more “calibres that make models ” than“ models that are celebrities. ”
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar's holder and Dior's ambassador, appeared on the cover in 2013, a year later she had the honour of Lagy Gaga.
But even though it is very unlikely that Kendall - which the magazine describes as a “breakthrough model” of her generation - will fall into the first category, he will be in a very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, nor stars of real estate show, or children today who know how to make a well-cut video (although Jenner represents all of this).
They're clearly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career due to the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course not everyone is thrilled about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymore, the original model Victoria's Secret in June, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called her "whores of the moment".
These feelings rekindled with the news that Jenner will appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner's on the cover of September Vogue.
It's a supermodel in the right sense.
It's for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you makeup from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter who took pictures for the LOWE magazine.
And in leisure moments, it works in reality show, maybe just as one of the ways to see Kortney and her kids.
Community Legal Aid Centres reject 160,000 people annually
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable citizens are rejected each year in the Community Legal Aid Centres and in the sector themselves are preparing for the impact that further financial constraints will have on the already excessively burdened services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, men at risk, victims of violence and people without funds to fight unjust evictions and the like - are refusing to seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so tense to crack, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal aid centres will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
Community Legal Aid Centre director James Farrell said that according to the latest summary report by the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centres, it was found that five thousand people were rejected each year.
Mr. Farrell said that without canceling the Federal Government's decision, the situation would get worse.
"The Community Legal Aid Centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are denied vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped from violent relations, people with excessive and debilitating debts, families through separation, workers who are unjustly released - all these people have problems with legal dimensions and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30 per cent, leading to thousands of other people at risk from Queensland being faced with complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the state's attorney and Senator George Brandise of Queensland to prevent this shortening of funds from getting people the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the government has achieved its commitment to provide funding for legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal aid centres and the communities of their clients and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign lawsuit after a member of the staff allegedly targeted the gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for alleged inaction after they were told that the director of operations in North Carolina directed a gun to a member of the staff during the Jeep ride.
The incident was described in the court file, which was handed over by Vincent Bordini, a former software campaign instructor in the state at Charlotte State on Wednesday.
Bordini said that he had been waiting months for the situation to be resolved internally before he came to the conclusion that it would not happen.
Director Earl Phillip “pointed his fingers at the gun, gave the right pointer to the trigger and directed the head of Vincent to the manor,” said Bordini in the lawsuit.
The report states that Bordini, after a complaint at the local and regional campaign, found that at least four other people had the same experience with Phillip.
“The gun does not have to fire to cause harm,” Bordini said in a lawsuit.
The lawsuit only comes two days after the Republican candidate for the president aroused his admiration when he told voters in North Carolina that they could step in on the owners and holders of the weapons (which is adjusted in the US in the second addition to the constitution), if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and is able to appoint his judge.
Trump's campaign says the media pulled his words out of context and Trump didn't defend himself.
Bordini in the lawsuit seeks compensation from the campaign for reckless supervision and from Phillip for endangering personal security, unlawful use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump's spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not immediately respond to a report requesting a comment.
Attempts to get comments from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news firm in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The call to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services was not responding in a short time.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of reconstruction and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is hugely attractive, just as London was in 2012, when we developed extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games meant huge benefits for the Startford and the East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
Only for our local communities will we create 10,000 new teaching sites, 40,000 new jobs, and we will end the unemployment of young people around the airport.
As before the London Olympics in 2012, there are those who will think that the expansion of Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would mock at the world stage.
Doubters were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow it turns out they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, an economic growth of 211 billion pounds, to leave heritage in the form of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team on Heathrow, which in time and with the budget set up an infrastructure investment programme of 11 billion pounds, starting with a T5 terminal - which was selected by the world's best terminal five years after T2 terminal, which was built between the two most disturbing raves in the world.
Now they are ready to add a third cut worth 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The games in London in 2012 were a huge success of Great Britain and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will also be a success.
It is time for us to continue spreading the spirit of the Olympic Games and expanding the Heathrow, to secure business for the future, and to abandon the heritage of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the Board of Directors and the former Deputy Trade Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook game on cat and mouse in blocking ads
Out of attempts to bypass advertising programs, for companies that make money on online marketing, it became a cat and mouse game. At least one of the companies that program such software claims it.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus published a post on its website stating that users can update filters in their program and reblock advertising on this social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the coding around ads to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the site are advertising.
But now Adblock claims that the new codes have already gone around.
A spokesman for Adblock Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this war between the open source advertising community and those who try to bypass them has been ongoing since advertising blocking was invented” and that Facebook will likely come with another self-repair.
The fact that a society that owns the world's largest social network in the war just proves how big a problem the blocking of advertising for industry has become.
According to the study, Pagefair performed the weave last year and Adobe uses advertising filters around 200 million people worldwide - nearly four times as many as it did in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84 percent of the profits from Facebook ads, Facebook from mobile devices visits 1.03 billion active users every day.
The speaker said that the company is going against advertising filters on the desktop because mobile advertising filters for mobile applications for social network and Instagram do not work.
Advertising on the desktop still represents profits so high that Facebook decides to invest in it.
Facebook also stated on Tuesday that it would update the "ad preferences" tool to give people the opportunity to better control how advertising is shown to them.
On Thursday, Facebook announced that Adblock's new filters were worrying them because they could also block content that was not related to advertising.
"It is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," said Facebook spokesman in an e-mail statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, and therefore we prefer to focus on building tools like Ad Preferences, which control people.
A woman was hit by a Swiss highway car
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses to an incident in which on Thursday morning a couple of cars were taken over by a woman who probably tried to commit suicide.
There was an accident on A1 highway near Morges in Vaud canton shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud stated in a statement that an actor of “hopeful crime” lay in the darkness on the road and moved several cars.
Clearly, the victim, a woman aged 49, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but according to the police, they have not all been identified yet. Police are calling on these drivers and all others who witnessed the accident to report.
A criminal investigation was opened, a “logical” step in a situation such as this, said to Le Tribune de Geneve attorney Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the impact?
This must be found out by the prosecutor," said Hofstetter.
On the basis of two similar cases in the past five years, drivers do not appear to be liable.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking along the highway - it was decided that motorists cannot expect a walker who is crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year a police officer was acquitted of being killed from negligence after she crashed and killed a man on the A1 highway near Paynerne in August 2014.
The court heard the victim at the age of 22 drinking alcohol and fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was in a reasonable way and that the presence of the man on the road was “a totally exceptional and unpredictable situation”, the judge said.
Anyone with information about the fourth incident that took place at Morges should report to the police on telephone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
It's a tolerant town.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Offices and Agencies (AČCKA) expects as many as 20,000 visitors to Prague Pride to come to Prague.
On Friday, the Executive Director of AČCKA Kateřina Petríčková said.
The sixth edition of Prague Pride began August 8th, the festival brings the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders (LGBT).
About 35,000 people attended the event last year.
"The powder belongs to the most popular LGBT community destination, for a high degree of tolerance and a wide range of specialised enterprises," Petríčková said.
According to the survey of organizers, foreign visitors spend on average 3100 crowns per person per day.
Gay tourists are available to support their travel special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps etc.
"For tourism, it is generally true that the LGBT clientele is very lucrative, is interested in stays in higher price relations with a high standard of travel services and spending more than others," Petríčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium is held this year as part of the festival programme.
It is taught by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday August 14th.
Love is the main theme this year, but the action will also address several thematic areas that include family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
On Saturday, the festival's summit will be a traditional parade with allegorical cars going from Václav Square to Summer.
This year, thousands of people took part in the incident, and this year, they honor the silence of the victims of a June attack at a nightclub in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Matt have been celebrating for 40 years.
The indecisive cauldrons of Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have been entertained by small and large spectators for 40 years.
The pilot part of this evening's show directed by Lubomír Beneš was premiered on August 12, 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, which now knows viewers in more than a hundred countries of the world, were cartoons by the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, who invented for the magazine with two stutters of Lord Ougolíček and Sedlec.
Beneš then called for the cooperation of the playwright Jiří Kubiečka and the artist Vladimír Jiranek and together they created the film Kutáci.
Today's image with a yellow and red shirt and a bullet and radio show was given in 1979, when a show for Slovak TV began in Prague's Short Film.
The names Pat and Mat then the cauldrons got in 1985, this time it was running directly for the short film Prague.
In 1990 Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of animated AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of whom were attended by Beneš’s son, Marek.
At present, there are over 90 episodes with stories of these cauldrons that are pouring under their hands, but they are never angry with each other, and they are always filled with optimism, ideas, and cauteristic enthusiasm, and are finally satisfied with their work, which will prove to be a familiar gesture "...and that is!".
Pat and Mat even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theaters and other toys depicting Pat and Mata are the hit of every toy.
A fairy tale for Fiji and two-year-old Harmony.
At the end of the week is a fairy tale, we have chosen one sports and one of our lives for you.
They both have a good ending.
Let's go see.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the cause of the earth’s joy?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and she's happy with her.
And on what matters do people spend most on airports?
This is a Friday review from world websites.
First medal of the Olympic Games.
Historic success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
Ragby's choice of this island defeated the team of Great Britain in the final Olympic football tournament.
It's the first medal Fiji ever won at the Olympics.
Waiting for the first precious metal’s profit took sixty years from sending the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
A great credit for success comes from Coach Fiji.
However, the irony is that it is British Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the finals as opposed to its nationals, the British citizen could be satisfied.
"Let's play it free and easy and see if we can make the biggest match in our history," the coach said before the finals.
Fiji eventually sovereignly controlled it, and a small state with 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The French daily Le Monde brought the report.
A new friend and luck for a little girl.
2-year-old Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without hands for 11 months and has got a new friend.
A little girl who looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," the two-year-old girl said to her mother for ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off her arms and legs and then sits together without prosthetics.
In less than a year of time, type B meningitis has been diagnosed, and doctors only gave her a ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny, and she never gives up.
He's got surveillance.
I've seen her introduce herself to the other kids with the word hello, I'm Harmony, and I don't have hands, my mother added.
Look at the joy of the doll.
What do we spend the most at the airport for?
CNN provides a finding according to which people at airports spend the most on bottled water.
The Hudson's travel essential store chain published data in the last year, where it collects 10 products that customers in its airport stores most often.
The water was sovereignly the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, eight of them were placed in the first decade.
The ninth place occupied a large packaging of M&M coconut sweets.
And can you guess who closes the first ten?
You can't eat as one of the above things.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win. They laughed at Murray and Bond.
The rowers Eric Murray and the Hamish Bond of New Zealand have Sovereignly ruled the category of two without a rudder for seven years and confirmed their dominance at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first sight, the disjoint couple moved to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and have been crushing competition since 2009.
In the Lagoon Rodrigo de Freitas, the 69th prize in a row was signed in the Thursday finals.
What are we different from the rest of us?
We're just nicer, mocked Murray already during the Olympic regatta, when he had to answer questions about the domination of the New Zealand couple.
To be honest, we don't do anything different with the others.
We're just practicing hard, really hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their domination is remarkable even because they are physically different.
Murray is almost a two-meter-old and stork-like passenger, an academically-looking Bond is 5 centimeters lighter and 15 kilograms lighter.
Besides, they have a different nature.
Bond is studying and dealing with finance, Murray is behind for example a charity boxing match.
Even so, she doesn't spend much time together outside the council.
Eric's getting on the boat basically with us not being able to lose.
Let's just win.
I have a tendency to think about what might go wrong, Bond admitted, who also showed at the press conference that Murray is dominant in the crew.
He was the one who always answered first and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
On the water, however, they destroy the rivals with a calm force.
They are moving at their own pace, and although often not yet in the middle of the line, the opponents have not yet found a prescription for their gradual acceleration.
We race on a two-mile track, and we never wanted to go the first mile.
We're just trying to move at a pace no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said 40-year-old Murray.
With his younger partner for four years, he won seven gold medals at the world championship.
They also triumphed in 2007, when both members of the golden four were without a rudder.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to move on to a couple without a helmsman.
At the London Olympics, apparently the greatest defeat of their careers was overturned and the Dominators confirmed even in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask any questions.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it was going to be damn hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally good at it, Murray said.
We all know that they want to overthrow us from the throne.
We've got that target on our backs all the time.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a resident
According to NASA's new climate model projections, Venus was once a resident.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Research developed a model for exploring Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by scientists involved in climate study.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, the surface of which is hot, waterless, and carbon dioxide could have conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low rate of turning Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
However, according to the latest simulations, Venus once seemed to be able to boast of a rare atmosphere similar to the Earth and to turn slowly.
The model also dealt with earlier topography of Venus.
On the planet there were probably more dry areas than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity to control life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus had previously used the sun, which was 30 percent thicker.
“In a simulation of the GISS model Venus, during a slow spin, exhibits its daily side to the sun almost two months at a time,” explained a scientist from GISS Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This is how the surface is heated and the rain forming a dense layer of clouds that act like umbrellas and surfaces protect against too much solar heat.
The result is climate with average temperatures, which are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
A model has drawn up a story of Venus similar to evolution, previously hypothetically composed by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably a resident in the past -- over a few billion years -- it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans evaporated, and the water vapors were burned by ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen has escaped and is left with only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas -- that's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from Venus’ new climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday to his post as coach and vice-president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey operations team for reasons of inability to participate in the decision-making process on the team's issues.
The executive vice president/general manager of Colorado Joe Sakic step confirmed and stated that the club will immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have acted as the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," said the 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
For a long and intensive time over the years, I've been thinking about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the visions of the trainer and the vice-president of the hockey operations be in line with the vision of the organisation.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his benefits to the team.
"Patric informed me about his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best league coach in his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to 112 points and the first place in the Central Division. However, Colorado was fighting with Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and in the last two years he has not always had matches since the season.
Avalanche team scored 39:39:4 in the season 2015/2016 and missed five points to get the second wild card in the Western Conference.
The goalkeeper Roy, who enrolled in the Hall of Fame, won Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
Oil platter workers in the North Sea resume talks and break strike
The senior representatives of the parties indicated that the strikes on wages for oil plaza workers in the North Sea were interrupted, while all parties to the dispute met on a new round of negotiations.
The strike against the oil company Wood Group was sporadically taking place on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
‘The Leader Group and the union organisations Unite and RTT may confirm that they have agreed to renew the process for resolving current conflicts’, the statement states.
Starting next week, we will have a series of all-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to union organisations, their recent action, which they said was the first in over 25 years, is up to 30 percent against wage cuts.
This year, Wood Group reduced its rates and paid its suppliers in the North Sea by about 9 percent less because of negative market pressures.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would give companies room to cope with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell removed thousands of people from his payroll and announced plans to leave oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to modernise its processes - immediately after a mega merger with the UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, Parliament member Dave Anderson met with union forerunners to discuss one of the biggest working accidents of the entire generation leading to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for all, not just for some," he said.
To compare, in 2016 nearly $1.4 billion is expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea, while the average over the past five years has been about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of turning the stars in the Playads
The newest mission of Kepler's Space Telescope to help astronomers is to get almost a complete list of the speed of turning the stars from the stargazer of the Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars in the constellation are spinning at different speeds, as well as how the time of rotation is related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars we will learn more about the relationship between the star matter, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebullová, a research worker at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Starship of Pleiades is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the forest are now reaching adulthood and have been created for over 125 million years.
Now he's turning around as fast as he can.
At the moment of maximum rotation, these teen stars release a huge amount of star wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the age of the star, its speed is slowing.
Kepler measures the speed of turning each star by measuring the time between discovering discernive points on the stars -- similar to the sun’s spots.
According to the latest data on speeds, larger stars are turning slower than smaller massive stars.
Rebull likes the stars to the dancers, makes the pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' we see that slowing stars are more massive, while those that spin the fastest are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the stargazer Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the quality of the stars and the speed of the spin.
"The plyades provide us with anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, in the younger and older stars," Rebull said.
Still, there is much to learn about how, when, and why the stars slow down their speed of turning, saying, “they will hang their dancing shoes on a nail. ”
Rebull and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of Pleiades’ speeds in three studies, which will soon be published in the journal Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualifying agreement necessary?
If I hadn't checked in, then the qualifying agreement wouldn't have closed, and after a few months, I could have gone to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work without applying for special training after an examination?
It is to me that in the field in which I want to work, there is now a job available only in a somewhat remote hospital, but in about six months, a place in another, where I would like to work.
So I don't know how to deal with the situation over the six months, the question goes on.
It's Mgr. Lenka Vlková's.
No legislation provides for the obligation to enter into a qualification agreement with the hospital employer.
The qualification agreement is a legal institution governed by the Labour Code and can be concluded between the staff member and the employer in order to ensure that the costs incurred are reimbursed in order to increase or deepen the qualifications of the staff member.
In the field of health care, there is a long-term pressure on the non-conclusion of these agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of healthcare professionals and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No 95/2004 Coll., the conditions for the acquisition and recognition of professional competence and the specialised competence to perform medical professions of a physician, dentist and pharmacist are expressly considered to be an intensification of the qualification (not for its promotion).
This means that a qualification agreement may be concluded under the Labour Code only if the costs amount to at least CZK 75,000.
No legislation nor does it provide for the obligation to apply for special training.
The law only lays down the conditions of application for specialisation training.
However, according to the law, the doctor is entitled to carry out the profession of a doctor already through the completion of the necessary university study, even though under the statutory conditions (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized competence in the relevant field).
The law foresees a situation in which a doctor may be enrolled in a specialised training course in a different field of specialisation if his content and scope are consistent with the relevant education programme.
In theory, it would be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the situation of the tasagent.
However, given that I do not know the circumstances of this case, it may be recommended to consult with the relevant committee of the Ministry of Health (Science and Medical Affairs), since the Ministry of Health provides legal advice and counselling services related to the inclusion in and the course of specialised education.
The Czech Medical Chamber also provides counselling services free of charge, to which each doctor must be a member.
Doctors from the Syrian Halab demand US intervention.
The United States has not developed any efforts to end the siege (restantial part of the city by the military) and has not used its influence to promote the protection of civilians, the AFP agency quoted from a letter addressed to the White House.
"We don't need tears, compassion, and even prayers; but we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over East Halab to stop the attacks, and we need an international action to ensure that Halab will not be surrounded again," the doctors said.
Russian forces supporting the army loyal to President Bashar Assad announced that he would stop daily for three hours in the Halab area to allow safe passage to humanitarian convoys.
