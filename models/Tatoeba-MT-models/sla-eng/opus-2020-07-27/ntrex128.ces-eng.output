Members of the Welsh congregation are concerned that they will “look like the Muppets ”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are in agreement with the proposal that their title should be changed to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The draft is based on plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Meeting members across the political spectrum are concerned that the name might make a mockery.
A member behind the Labour Party said that his group is afraid that “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp. ”
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
A member for the Plaid said that the group as a whole “not happy” and proposed alternatives.
The Welsh conservative said that his group was approaching a change in the name “with an open mind, ” but noted that the MWP is close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter “w” is worded similarly as the letter “u” in Yorkshire English.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is now preparing legislation to introduce changes to the name, stated: “The final decision on what members of the Welsh Assembly will be called will, of course, be on their own. ”
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals, where broad support was given the option of calling the Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of members of the assembly, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or the WMP, but the version of the MWP received the greatest support in the public discussion.
The Assembly members are obviously proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus may be of concern to President Elin Jones, who is to present a draft legislation within a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including the rules for disqualification of members and the draft committee system.
Members of the assembly will vote on the issue of their title in the context of the negotiation of new legislation.
Macedonians to vote on change in country name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether the name of their country will change to “Republic of Northern Macedonia”.
All vote should resolve the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
The Athens have long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a claim in Greek territory and repeatedly protest against the country's EU and NATO membership applications.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is a plebiscite who opposes change of name, said he would not follow the vote.
However, the advocates of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, argue that the change of name is simply the price for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will be silent because the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival.
“The old people I spoke to say that they had been at every corner of the bar and church before,” said Mr. Adams.
"There's not one today."
The disappearance of bars is understandable to him.
"People today meet in a different way," he says.
"Bars are no longer the living quarters of the neighborhood where people regularly go."
Regarding churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started. ”
As he adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of such people who do not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white," he says, "and so soon the day will come when these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into apartments will become members of churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved away in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the Black Congregation, whose piety took place not far from here.
St. Martin took over the Black Congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping mall in Harlem, who refused to hire or raise black people.
In 1939 the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a bell ring.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, proudly called the bells of the poor.
The expert, who played the bell in July, called her “cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that she was the first bell-ringer in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved on 18 years ago to a larger bell-ringer at a church in Riverside.
Mr. Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's.
During the past few months, a complicated story of architects and builders has been played with St. Martin, some of whom have been summoned by lay representatives of the church, others by Episcopal Diocese.
The Council of Elders, the director of the parish, composed of lay representatives, sent a letter in July, expressing concern that the diocese “will seek to pay costs” to the council of elders, although the hiring of architects and builders that the diocésa sent did not take part.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy in California who dived for lobsters
According to the official report, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who sank in California for the lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the station KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and then he and the group were rowing to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he considered the call to be joy from the catch of the lobster at first, but then “you realized that they were shouting, ‘ Bite me!
Bite me!”
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that “he had broken the whole area of the collarbone. ”
“I cried out that everyone should go out of the water, ‘There is a shark in the water!’ Hammel adds.
The boy was taken by helicopter in critical condition to the Children's Hospital Hospital in San Diego.
It's not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
The swimmer, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that the shark had been seen in this area several weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper hull.
For the sake of investigation and security, authorities have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca after Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the cosmetics market in Britain
Sainsbury's wants to build the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains with cosmetic alleys in the style of a business house, where specialized salesmen will be available.
In the context of a strong entry into the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and still continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household needs is declining, the streets with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores throughout the country. If successful, then the next year will be expanded to other shops.
The investment in cosmetics is linked to the efforts of supermarkets to find use for racks used previously for televisions, microwaves and household needs.
Sainsbury's notes that it doubles the size of the offer of cosmetic products up to 3,000 products and introduces for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw.
More space will also receive an existing range from L'Orreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands thanks to brands similar to those in stores like Boots.
Supermarket also reintroduces its range of make-up Boutique, so most products will be vegan, which young customers increasingly require.
In addition, in two stores of Saintsbury’s will test concessions of a retailer of Fragrance Shop perfumes. The first such trade was opened last week in Croydon in the south of London and next year it will be created in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Shopping on the Internet and moving towards daily shopping for a small amount of food in local shops means that supermarkets have to try harder to attract people.
Director-General Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says that stores will look more and more like business houses because a chain of supermarkets is trying to better offer services and non-food products to fight discount sellers such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened hundreds of stores at Argos branch and also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are chains he bought two years ago. As a result, food sales increased and acquisitions were even more profitable.
The previous attempt at a supermarket to recycle the department with cosmetic and pharmaceutical range ended infamously.
At the beginning of the millennium Sainsbury’s tested the joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after an argument about distribution of profits from drug sales in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s sold its 281 drugstores three years ago for 125 million pounds to Celesio, who owns Lloyds' drug chain.
Lloyds is going to play his role in the plan by adding to four stores an extended range of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Business director Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We changed the look and style of cosmetic streets to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our range of brands should satisfy all needs and attractive environments, and an advantageous location means that we now represent an attractive place to buy cosmetics that changes the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones is "angry" after Holly Willoughby resigned from the contract for £11 million
Star Dragons Dan Peter Jones “suspenses” after TV moderator Holly Willoughby stepped down from a $11 million contract with his lifestyle stamp to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home clothes and Truly's accessories.
Doing this couple was likened to the Goop act of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The seven-year-old moderator announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's angered the star of Dragons Dan Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to informed sources, Jones “surpassed” when a television star at a tense Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that because of the new contracts — worth up to £1.5 million — would no longer be able to devote enough time to their brand of domestic clothing and accessories to Trula.
The company was likened to the Goop acta Gwyneth Paltrow and could double the wealth of moderator Willoughby in an estimated value of £11 million.
When 17 - year - old Willoughby announced on Instagram that Truly was leaving, Jones left Britain for one of his summer seats.
The unnamed source states: “Truly’s brand was a top priority for Holly.
It was meant to be her long-term future, which would provide her for decades ahead.
Her decision to leave all the participants was absolutely shocking.
No one on Tuesday could believe what was happening, the launch was so close.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sale goods at Marlowe headquarters."
Experts believe that the departure of the moderator of this Morning, which belongs to the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions in view of the massive investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothes and the possible further delay in marking.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016 and the twenty-two-year-old Jones joined the board in March.
Couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become M&S ambassador and replace Anta McCorlin with I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Difficult Deals “And Then We Fall in Love ”
He joked about the criticism he would get from journalists as a comment that some consider “necessary president” and how positively he speaks of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with his mocking “vote ” voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that after their June first meeting in Singapore Trump appreciated as a big step towards denuclearizing North Korea, Kim is interested in another meeting.
But the nuclear-weapon-freese negotiations are deadlocked.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, a prominent North Korean diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that North Korea, from the United States, does not see a “responsible response” to its first steps to disarmament.
Instead, the US continues with sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We are doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were at the edge of the war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His efforts to improve relations with Kim, according to him, brought positive results – ending rocket tests, helping freeing hostages and returning the rest of American soldiers to their homeland.
And he defended his unusual approach to informing about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to a crowd ahead of us.
tsunami waves and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
In the post - Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that there was no need.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s inhabitants were evicted from their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a bit difficult," Mrs Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children's organization brings together a team that travels to Pal, it is not clear whether foreign personnel can work here.
Mr Sutupo, the National Disaster Speaker Agency, said that the Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paul to see if it would be possible for international organisations to help.
Since earthquakes occur in Indonesia very often, the earth is still unprepared at the wrath of Mother Nature.
At Aceh, shelters against the tsunami were built, but on other parts of the coast, it is not normal.
The apparent lack of sirens warning in Paul against the tsunami probably contributed to the loss of human lives, even though the warning was issued.
Even at best, travel between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which anchored in Lombok and helped the earthquake victims, is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days before it reaches the site of the new calamite.
Improving poor Indonesian infrastructure was the main point of President Joko Vidodo's election campaign and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
Next year, he will seek re-election, but his government is hampered by funding shortfalls.
President Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, when members of the Muslim majority accept a more conservative form of faith.
Street fights between Christians and Muslims using machetes, bows, and arrows and other primitive weapons have already claimed the lives of more than a thousand people, and tens of thousands have driven from their homes.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored a balancing goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in 89th minute in London's Stamford Bridge on Saturday, saving Liverpool from losing Chelsea in Premier League.
Sturridge got a passport from Xherdan Shaqi about 27 meters outside Chelsea Gate when his team was losing 1-0.
He switched the ball to the left and fired at the distance rod.
The shot was flying high and heading to the right upper corner of the gate.
The ball finally jumped over the jumping Kepa Arizabalag and ended up in the net.
“I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible.” said Sturridge server LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching me, so I didn't think much about it, and I fired at one touch."
Chelsea led 1-0 half-time after the goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
Attacker Blues sent the passport back to Mateo Kovacic, then turned around in the middle of the field and printed in half of Liverpool.
Kovacic played the ball fast.
Then he sent the ball to the beautiful street of Hazard in the lime.
He fled the defense and ended up with a left-handed pole next to Alison Becker from Liverpool.
On Wednesday at 15:00 Liverpool in the League of Masters at the San Paolo Stadium in Italy is in contact with the local team.
Chelsea will play on Thursday at 15:00 in London with Videoton in the UEFA European League.
The number of victims of tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832
As the Indonesian Disaster Bureau said Sunday morning, the number of earthquake victims and tsunami waves climbed to 832.
The 7.5-degree earthquake struck on Friday, caused waves of up to 6 metres high, and trapped many people in ruins of destroyed buildings, Sutopo Purwo Nugro said at a press conference.
The city of Paul, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was visited by ruins of destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a 23-year-old suspect from a stab wound.
This morning, a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and the police immediately launched a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7.55 on Grayson Mews on John Street, based on suspicion of murder, a 32-year-old man was arrested.
The police called in people in the area who saw or heard something to sign up.
Detective Brian O'Hagan puts it this way: “The investigation is only at the beginning, but I would like to appeal to all those who were moving near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially the taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras may have recorded something to contact us, because they may have important information for our investigation,"
Police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
Friends arrive this afternoon at the crime scene who think they know a woman to ask where she was found this morning.
Police said there was an investigation and now they're informing the victims' relatives.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews was just trying to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to speak.
The residents now learned that it would take several hours for them to return home.
A man was told by a police officer that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman showed up at the scene.
He keeps saying, "That's terrible."
At 14 o'clock, there were two police vans behind the tape, and the others were waiting outside.
There are a number of police officers in the closed area who monitor the house.
Anyone with any information may send a message to @MerPolCC, call on line 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on number 0800 555 111 and enter code 247 of September 30.
Socha Cromwell in Parliament has recently become a hit because of the argument of "rewriting history"
His exile would have been a punishment for the destruction of many English cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatic Puritan followers in the Taliban style.
But Cromwell Society called Mr Crick's proposal "stupidity" and "the desire to rewrite history."
President Cromwell of the Society, John Goldsmith, says: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that one of the goals would be to the character Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not order or perform iconoclasm in English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The magnificent creation of Cromwell, authored by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the view of the 19th century and part of the histography of the figure that many still believe deserves to be celebrated.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, although today somewhat less than in the late 19th century, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of uninterrupted historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century created a subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identified figure that represents one side of this transition.
His achievements in the function of the Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
A Chinese farmer's been torn apart by a killer pig
According to local media, there was an assault and death of a pig farmer on the market in south-eastern China.
As South China Morning Post wrote on Sunday, a man with only the last name “Yuan” was found dead with a bruised artery in a pool of blood near the Liu-pchan-shui market in Kui-chou province.
The pig breeder is preparing to administer the vaccine to pigs in spring 30 May 2005 in the town of Si-ning in the Province of Ching-chai of China.
Apparently on Wednesday, he and his cousin came from the province of Jün-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found the door to the next dumpster open.
He thinks there was a big pig in the barn with blood on it.
According to information, forensics confirmed that he ripped up a 250-pound pig farmer.
“Brother had legs all bloody and torn,” the daily Guiyang Evening News cousin quoted him as saying “Wu”.
The security footage shows Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4.40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News daily that the pig was closed so that no one else would be attacked when the police at the crime scene were gathering evidence.
Market representatives allegedly treat Yuan's family for compensation for his death.
The attacks of pigs on humans are rare, but they have already occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts and the man was critically injured.
Ten years earlier, 300kg of pig lured a Welsh farmer into a tractor and driven him away by a farmer’s wife.
After an Oregon farmer ate his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can function as a “launcher”.
“They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring strong rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa, as predicted, is weakening and moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, a flood flood will take place in northern Mexico and in the southwest of the United States.
At 5 a.m. Eastern time, Rosa reached a wind speed of 137 km/h, representing Category 1 hurricane, located 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, low pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving east to the western coast of the United States. On Monday, when Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California, it will be like a tropical storm and will push tropical humidity north into the southwest of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico Rosa on Monday will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation.
Tropical humidity then, with the approaching low pressure gap in the coming days, will trigger massive rain in the southwest of the United States.
Precipitation 25 to 100 mm locally causes dangerous floods, currents of soil and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation to reach 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected in some places in the southwest of the United States, especially over most Arizona.
In the event of rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain, torrential floods may occur.
In view of the dangers of tropical precipitation, it would be unwise to walk into the desert.
Heavy rain may cause canyons to become raging rivers and storms to bring local shocks and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure storm will bring strong local precipitation on some parts of the coast of Southern California.
There may be a total precipitation of more than 13 mm, which could cause a smaller flow of sutines and slippery carriages.
It will be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Sunday night and Monday morning, the unique tropical outcasts begin to approach Arizona and on Monday night and on Tuesday the rain will spread.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to four corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes across the United States, because the Arctic is starting to cool down, but in the tropical zone it will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to extreme temperature changes at short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the middle of the United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omahou in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa there is a difference of nearly 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few today, they will try again to spread the pervasive summer heat.
In most areas in the middle and east of the United States, warm early October with temperatures of about 27 °C from the southern plains to the north-east of the United States is expected.
On Tuesday, New York City could be 27 °C, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of excessive temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's interview followed over 20 million people
More than 20 million people were watching on six television channels the fourth secret statement of a candidate in the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault who allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political side situation continued, and the voters interrupted routine programs with reports of a sudden Friday's return: an agreement mediated by Senator Jeff Flake for Arizona that the FBI would conduct a one-week indictment.
Christine Ford told the Senate court that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had her at a high school drunk party and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh said in his excited statement that he's 100% sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the event was followed by more than 20.4 million people, reported by Nielsen.
The company calculated average ratings at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for the other stations that broadcast the notices, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look in offices.
To compare, it is a similar number of viewers who watch football matches in playoffs or Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest ratings of all stations, with an average of 5.69 million viewers watching him during the entire day's hearing, according to Nielsen.
The second was ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen states that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest persisted even after the end of the negotiations.
Senator Flake was the leading figure in Friday's drama.
After the office of this temperate republic has issued a statement that it will vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning caught the protestor shouting at him when he was about to take the elevator to the hearing of the court.
CNN was live streaming for a few minutes with his eyes closed and he got his shit together.
A woman said, “I am standing right in front of you. ”
"Do you think the earth is telling the truth?"
He also heard: “You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he added that he would say more at the commission's meeting.
All cable and television networks were later broadcast live when the judicial commission was to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do that if the charges against the candidate were investigated by the FBI by next week, which a minority of Democrats demanded.
Flakea was partly convinced by interviews with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that without an investigation, the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "politicians" about Brexit
Minister President Theresa May accused critics of their plan to leave the European Union in a discussion for the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa Mayova arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the prime minister on the front page, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect their duties was "inextricably pointless".
Waydea Sims shooting: Police arrested Dytheon Simpson, who is suspected of the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the case of the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported that Dytheon Simson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder.
The authorities released a video of confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the Sims police, he lost his glasses during the fight.
According to the WABF channel under CBS, the police secured the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
According to the police, Simpson admitted after questioning that Waydea had been shot.
According to the defense attorney, bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The Department thanks the police unit to the Louisiana State refugees, the state police criminal laboratory, Southern University police and local citizens for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local police for "the drink and the pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-meter shooter grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU,
In the last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps to the game.
The basketball coach LSU Will Wade said on Friday morning that Wayde's death was "shaking" and "shocking" him.
"This is what you're always afraid of," Wade said.
Sopka hurls ash on Mexico City
The ash coming out of Popacatepetl volcano hit the south quarter of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano after the volcanic activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The Centre watched a number of riots and earthquakes.
On social networks, images of cars covered by a thin layer of ash in some parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, appeared.
Geophysicals recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 72 kilometres (45 miles) southeast of the capital. The last earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017 and had a strength of 7.1 degrees.
The volcano known as “Don Goyo” has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the vote on independence, the police met with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the independence protestors met with the police, and thousands were involved in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence, which was divided by Catalonia.
The regular police blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powder at them, and the ones on the streets, which are usually flooded tourists, created a dark cloud of dust.
Later, there were also clashes that the police had to use earrings to calm them.
In a few hours, independence groups sang "We Will Not Forget, We Will Not Forgive" in the face of the protestors of the Union who called "Let Spain Live".
According to the local press, 14 people were slightly injured in protests.
One year after the 1st referendum, which Madrid considers to be illegal, but the separatist Catalans celebrate, there remains tension in the region seeking independence still high.
Voters from the vast majority spoke out for independence, but participation in the elections was low because the opponents boycotted them.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police in violent clashes across the region tried to end the vote in the polls.
Independence support groups stayed out on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of national police.
The demonstration may have taken place, but she had to choose another route.
Eighty-eight-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes to gain independence for Catalan.
“Last year we had some of the best times.
My parents cried with joy that they could vote, but now we are in a dead end," he said.
Despite the importance of the close victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence-supporting parties had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their most famous leaders either went to exile themselves or were awaiting trial for their participation in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 23-year-old monter, recorded a protest to support the police on his phone, saying that the conflict was being blown away by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting tense," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he would run for the European Parliament.
"The best way to judge the decline in democratic values and the repression that we are witness to by the Spanish Government in the European elections," he said.
Londonderry: Men trapped after a car crash in the house
Three men at the age of 33, 34, and 39 were imprisoned after being repeatedly attacked by a car in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Bloomings said there was a breach of the gate and the house itself.
At one point, someone might have shot at the car, too.
Meng's hit secured Livingstone winning 1-0 over Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Mengy for Livingstone ensured victory
Livingstone, who left the lower division, shocked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of 18 matches as the manager of the club from Ibrox.
Dolly Mengy's shot proved decisive when Gary Holt's team reached the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team doesn't have a winner in the Premiership league this season, and next Sunday they'll be the first Hearts to lose eight points.
Even before Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League.
Livingston expanded a series of games without defeat in the division to six games, so chief coach Holt, who last month replaced Kenny Miller, hasn't yet tasted the defeat.
Livingston didn't take his chances against the unspeakable guests.
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before the goal, because his directness was causing Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through with the defense, but he failed in front of the gate, and then Alan Lithgow in the slide just passed Craig Halkett's head in front of the goal.
Homework was enough to watch the Rangers play in front of them because they knew that guests could suffer from standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
Against Rangers was ordered free kick and Livingston created a skulin, Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly sent Menga, who ran and scored the ball in the middle of the penal territory.
At this stage the Rangers dominated holding the ball, but the home defense was impenetrable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly mostly did not have much work.
The same picture of the game was in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly into action.
Scott Pittman was stopped by goalie Rangers Allan McGregor, and Lithgow did not face another standard situation in Livingston.
In the penal territory of Livingston, the centres that players continuously cleaned were constantly flying and there were two penalty kicks — after Halkett’s attack on Deputy Glenn Middleton and another by the hand.
“Phenomén” from Livingstone – Analysis
Alasair Lamont with BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Awesome performance and result for Livingston.
They were without exception excellent and on their way up they continue to overcome expectations.
Their style of play and men have almost not changed since their return to the peak, but Holt deserves great praise for how he has stirred up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was enormous, leading a brilliantly organized defense, while Menga maintained the entire time in Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall's alert.
Rangers were lacking inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they don't meet these standards anymore.
Their ending was lame – only once penetrated the home page – and for Rangers it should be a wake-up call because they are located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan awaited a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th), the sky was blue and all smiling.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, aimed at correcting relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on a number of topics, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
In this town is the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but there were many supporters around who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people were also heard, many of whom were Kurds – protestors against Erdogan, who condemned his politics and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
Contradictive protests reflect the controversy of a visitor, whom some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed as an autocrat.

Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in the riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured in riots in a male prison with high guard.
The riots erupted in Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 local time and continue.
To cope with the riots involving eight prisoners in one wing, special supervisors from the Tornado team were called.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated locally.
Commenting on the prison service, he said: “The handling of the ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison has been specially trained by prisoners.
Six personnel were treated with injuries.
In our prisons, we do not tolerate violence, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend more time behind bars."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June, it was announced that the warden of the prison ended up attacking a prison in the hospital.
And last October, a law enforcement unit was called to the prison for serious disturbances in which the staff was attacked by pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens the floods Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the area where it is dry can benefit)
It is not customary for Arizona to hit a tropical low pressure storm, but that is what will happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa crosses the desert southwest and brings the risk of floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued a warning before the floods on Monday and Tuesday from Western Arizona for South and East Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix on Twitter stated that “only ten tropical cyclones have been kept in the distance of 320 km from Phoenix, either tropical storm status or pressure below!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane another 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Center for Hurricanes predict precipitation 50 to 100 mm, in Movollon Rome area in Arizona places up to 150 mm.
In other desert northwest areas, including the centre of the Skalist Mountains and the Great Belt will likely fall 25 to 50 mm, with local ranges up to 100 mm.
For those who are not threatened by floods, the rain of Rosa may be a blessing because the area has hit dry.
The floods are a very serious matter, but these precipitations may also help, because the Southwest of the United States has just hit dry.
The weather.com server reports that according to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona experience “extreme drought”, which is the second highest category.
The journey of Hurricane Rosa will first lead to the peninsula Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane power with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then Sunday morning will be 620 km south of Punt Eugenia in Mexico and will be moving at a speed of 19 km/h north.
Then the storm will meet the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, and thus it will lose its strength.
Mexico is expected to arrive Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, precipitation will be strong, which presents a high risk of flooding.
“In the area of Baja California, total precipitation is expected from 75 to 150 mm in the north-west of Sonoru, with up to 250 mm likely to occur,” says the weather.com server.
Then Rosa is like a tropical storm across Mexico to the north, and on Tuesday morning she will arrive at Arizona border. Then she will pass by Arizona and on Tuesday late evening she will enter South Utah.
"The main risk of Russia or its remains is expected to be very severe collisions in Baja California, Northwest Sonore and desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center reports.
These rains are expected to cause deadly floods and streams of dust in the deserts and landslides in the upper terrain.
Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 local time.
He was moved to the hospital, and his condition is now “stable. ”
According to Avon and Somerset police, young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained at night in the Radstock area.
The cops are looking for witnesses who might have a record of what happened on their cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh “tasted the wickedness and rage” of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the reckless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a party in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump declared that Kavanaugh, during the process of his nomination, “tasteed the wickedness and anger of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh spoke in front of Congress on Thursday, where he firmly and emotionally refused to complain to Christine Blasey Ford that decades ago, when they were teenagers, he sexually assaulted her.
Ford was also testifying at the hearing about her accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that “American witnesses were of Kavanaugh’s greatness and quality and courage. ”
A representative of his supporters from West Virginia said that “the vote of Judge Kavanaugh is the confirmation of one of the greatest legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has excellent public service in the account. ”
The president had a direct impact on Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is for the Republicans to participate in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't run, but I'm still on the move," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump declared that the Democrats had decided to "resist and obstruct".
The management counsel of the Republican Party told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the floor of the Senate is expected no later than Friday.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the number of victims is still rising
On Saturday, authorities announced that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of which were littered by huge waves that flooded the beaches.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered on a beach in Pal on Friday, but at dusk, the coast was hit by up to six meters of waves that killed many people and destroyed everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami wave preceded an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the threat of tsunami appeared yesterday, people continued in activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they fell down waves for the victim," said the spokesman of the Indonesian agency for the mitigation of the BNPB Suthopo Purwo Nugro's funeral at Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't go alone, it took cars, logs, houses, everything on the ground," Nugro said, adding that before the impact on the coast, tsunamis on the open sea spread at 800 km/h.
He said that some people fled to the trees before the wave and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
The aerial photos that the disaster mitigation agency has published show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a water-encircled mosque.
The consequences were shaken by the coastal city on Saturday as well.
A series of earthquakes was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
In its statement, the Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released by Friday's powerful shocks was approximately 200 times the nuclear bomb force dropped during World War II in Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow cove, which could have increased the tsunami.
Nugrogo described the damage as “extremely” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels had been destroyed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found cursed under the wreckage of destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho informed that the amount of victims and damage could be greater on the coast 300 km north of Palo, in the area called Donggala, which is close to the earthquake epicentre.
According to him, the communication was “completely protected without any information” from Donggala.
The Red Cross stated in his statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that his workers and volunteers are heading to affected places.
"It is a tragedy, but it could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency faced considerable criticism because it did not inform that Pal was hit by a tsunami wave, even though the authorities said waves came at the time the warning was issued.
On amateur images shared in social media, a man on the higher floor of a building with a desperate scream warns people on the street of approaching tsunamis.
In a few minutes, the coast will hit the water wall that carries the buildings and cars.
The Reuters agency was unable to verify the recording immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunami waves caused a major blackout of electricity, which interrupted communications around Pal, so the authorities could only easily coordinate rescue work.
According to the authorities, the army has begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only for the transport of assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Pal on Saturday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has climbed to over 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggaly came to Paula, where employees hide in shelters from cells built in the yard of the office building, they saw images of destruction on the way, says Mr Doseba.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he adds.
It's too bad.
When assisting groups initiated a sad disaster relief activity, some complained that foreign workers with great experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
According to the Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can start at the site of the calamity only when the national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the level of the province,” says the spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross Aulia Arriani.
"As soon as the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster', we can launch international aid, but this is not yet a state of affairs."
When the second night of the Friday earthquake and tsunami arose in Paul, friends and relatives of those who were still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that alleviate the grim stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, the paramedics liberated a woman who had been trapped under the wreckage for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists at the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Another of the people imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
"As a person who has been paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr Gendon explained how in the hours following the paragliding community learned about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, he was desperately sending messages through WhatsApp to contestants from Pal who participated in the beach festival.
But instead of a pair of blue ticks, his messages ended with a grey mark.
"I think it means that the reports have not been delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 while adding an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a police department report in Newport, the thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from Brink's employee in addition to an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the car driver emptied the ATM machine in a fun complex and was preparing to invest more money in it.
When he did so, another man “went behind the staff of Brink” and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in an ATM.
According to the press report, several suspects were seen fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incidents.
If you have any information on the identity of the suspects, please inform the NYPD at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, which he wrote: “The entity formally known as Kanye West.”
The 48-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the pseudonym as the name of his eighth album, which appeared in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he should specify his new album Yandhi.
In the show, she will replace the singer Ariane Grande, who cancelled her participation for “sense reasons”, as the creator of the show said.
West has already said that the word for him has a religious significance besides shortening the existing professional name.
“In my opinion, ‘ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, where ‘you’ means,’” West was heard earlier this year when he spoke about his album with Radio moderator Big Boy.
"So I am you, we are us.
It's changed from Kanya, which means the only one, to just Ye, as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are."
The name has also changed a number of other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known in various periods as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
Ex West's associate JAY-Z also wrote his name alternately with the clutch and without him and in large and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
On the occasion of the approaching 50th anniversary of a bloody attack against students, the newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Oberdor pledged never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday at Tlatelco Plaza promised that he would “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people. ”
At a time when a leftist student movement spread throughout Latin America, soldiers on October 2, 1968 started shooting people at a peaceful demonstration in the square and killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those studying and by opening up other free public universities.
He declared that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding of artificial intelligence
According to the investor and expert on the artificial intelligence of Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the US should double the amount they spend on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the US government have published announcements about AI, although the US as a whole do not have any formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China introduced a plan last year, according to which it wants to be the one in innovation AI by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are far beyond the US and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI," Lee says.
Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week that doubling funding could double the chance that the next big discovery in the AI area would be made in the US.
Lee, who published this month in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's book “Supervelities AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order”, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on the AI system, which surpassed the best American player in Othello, and later led research by Microsoft and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee appreciated previous U.S. government technological competitions, such as the Robotic Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when he would be next to help identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants, according to Lee.
"The academic peaks are not driven by China, but by corporations," Lee says.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employing the best university experts in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Changes in immigration policy could also help to improve efforts in the field of AI, according to Lee to the United States.
“I think that a doctorate in AI should be offered a green card automatically,” he says.
The State Council of China issued an artificial intelligence development plan for a new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the National Science Council and other government organizations give money to researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, says Lee.
The U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence this year to involve partners from the sector and from the academic environment, and the White House announced the creation of a selection commission for artificial intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF Foundation, it now invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
However, the U.S. legislation, which wanted to create a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, has failed for many months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether they want to change the country name
Macedonians voted Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocks applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory, and therefore welcomed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for boycott raised doubts as to whether the minimum 50 per cent of voters would be available to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was, "Are you for NATO and EU membership with the coming of an agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that it is a price worth paying to make Macedonia one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia. could join the organisation as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska of Skopje.
Although the referendum is not binding, enough members of Parliament have said that they will follow the outcome of the vote.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no problems were reported within 13 hours.
However, the election was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters eventually cast their vote.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old voter from Skopje capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko return their votes in the Macedonian referendum on a change of name that would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and pulls chairs in front of tents built by people who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads up, not the service door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has a rate of unemployment exceeding 20%, so much needed investment.
"I think the great majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
The result “yes” would be“a confirmation of our future”.
According to a survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday, the referendum could be attended by between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters – which is less than the required participation.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV station revealed that 57 percent of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it must be attended by 50 percent plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first serious blow to the policy of the Western government since its accession last May.
Look: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City has come for the goal through the entire Brighton defense.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday handled Brighton's defense and ensured Manchester City win 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In the administration of Aguerre, his goal looked ridiculously easy in 65 minutes.
It all started with a video the Argentine attacker got in the middle of the field.
He printed among three Brighton defenses and got into open space.
Aguera then surrounded four green jerseys.
At the edge of Brighton's penal territory, one defender walked around, and several others ran.
He found Sterling on the left.
The English invader nailed the ball back to Aguerre, who beat the goalie Brighton Mathew Ryan with a shot at the right side of the network.
“Aguero has problems with his legs,” reported reporters at City Pep Guardiola.
"We thought he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky he scored at that point."
The initial advantage for Sky Blues in this match, Prime Minister League, however, arranged Sterling.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane's ball worked and then sent Sterling to a remote pole.
Attacker Sky Blues threw the ball into the net just before he slipped off the field.
City will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the League of Masters at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to spoil the joy of Rockies
When the Nationals were excluded from the playoff fight, there were not many reasons to re-enter.
But eternally competitive Scherzer hopes to take the place of a pitcher in a match against Colorado Rockies on Sunday – but only if they have the Rockies who lead the NL West for one game over Los Angeles Dodgers, hope for the playoffs.
On Friday night, the Rockies secured at least a wild card with a 5-2 victory over Nationals, but they still want to win their first title in the division.
“Even if we don’t play, we can at least start because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will play with the greatest effort I’m going to experience this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play?"
Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but reportedly is reluctant to pitch the Scherzer in such a situation.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34th start.
In this season, Washington's right-hand pitcher has statistics 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 shifts.
Trump appeared at an assembly in West Virginia
The President spoke indirectly about the situation around his candidate for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about how important it is for the Republicans to participate in the mid-term elections.
“In November, everything we have been able to do will be at stake.
There are five weeks left in one of the most important choices of our lives.
It is one of the big, big – I do not run, but we are still on the move and I fight everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see the terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
And they're determined to take power by whatever means they need, you see the wickedness, the disgust.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to fight to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give them."
According to him, the Democrats opted for “resistance and obstruction. ”
“And you see it in the last four days,” he added, “the Democrats are“ angry and angry and repugnant and lying. ”
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judicial Commission, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to the loud noise of the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document out?
Uh, what?
No, um no, wait – that was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse power of opinion.
He is intolerant to those who express their opinions
When activists from Momento on my local side voted for my reminder, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs to say that they are not welcome – because they have sincerely said their opinion.
My fellow Parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she stood up to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, regarding national security, about Europe, paradoxically similar matters on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Friday Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East stated that “we want meetings to be accessible and productive.”
Most of the eight years that I was a local member of Parliament behind the Labour Party were meetings of the GC on Friday night.
Unfortunately, most meetings are not being held today, and the promise of a “kinder, gentler ” policy has long since been forgotten if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that different views do not tolerate themselves in the Laburistic side and that each view is assessed whether it is acceptable for the management of the party.
It began shortly after Jeremy became the leader. Colleagues, whom I had previously thought we had similar political opinions, suddenly expected me to turn 180° and stand up for positions that I would otherwise not agree with – whether national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn't matter what I say – then there's a tirade of social networking gimmicks calling for my appeal, condemning Wednesday's politics and telling me I shouldn't be on the lab.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments on me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a rush of sexual or racist insults every day, but never give up.
One aspect of this era of politics, of which I am most disappointed, is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the diverse power of opinion, and with any proposal to express distrust or change the rules of choice, the party is becoming more limited.
Over the last two years, I've been working so hard to hold back, not to call myself that much, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not what I went into politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who had let my general school class literally fall apart, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be surprised at my political positions and areas in which I disagree with existing leadership.
To those who supported this proposal on Friday, I would only say that if the country penetrates Brexit, which will damage households, businesses and our public services, I do not see the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my main message is not addressed to the Moment in Nottingham, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of appeal or political pragmatism will discourage me from acting in my opinion the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is Parliamentary Member for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The undefeated Ayr rises to the climax
Two late fives slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully entertaining match Tennant's Premiership.
Now they're headed by a table like the only failures.
Finally, it was an excellent defense and better use of chances that helped the household win, and coach Peter Murchie had the full right to be satisfied.
"We have been through a lot of trials in our games and we are still indisposed, so I have to be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: “All honors to Ayru, they took chances better than we did. ”
Grant Anderson's fifth in the 14th minute, changed by Frazier Clem, sent Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who was released for the match by Warriors, made it possible for Melrose to take advantage of the number advantage, and Jason Baggott got an unchanged five.
Climo increased Ayru's leadership with penalty and then scored exactly half the time and changed the solo attempt, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's fifth, transformed by Baggott, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a longer delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridha Knott, who left the field on the stretchers, and when it began playing again, Ayr jumped again thanks to the five Stafford McDowals that Climate changed.
Representing Captain Ayru Blair Macpherson then got the yellow card and Melrose again used the players additionally thanks to Bruce Colvin's unchanged five after a short high pressure.
Of course, the natives returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for attacking Clem without the ball, MacPherson from the penalty line put the ball behind Ayru's advancing maul.
Climo changed, almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught the kick of David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth houseman.

Still Game Ford Kieran appears to be moving to the hospitality field. It has been discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Six hundred-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show that he writes and plays along with Greg Hemphill's long-standing comedy partner.
The two of them announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the final series, and Kiernan seems to be planning her life after Craiglang.
According to the extract from the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but the source of the newspaper Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan wanted to join “a prosperous business in restaurants” in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the La Paz Naval Command, decorated with ropes.
There is a blue flag in the ocean over public buildings.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for Amazon are described in the slogan: “The sea is our right.
Getting it is our duty."
In all of the inland Bolivia there is still a vivid memory of the coast which the country lost in favour of Chile in the bloody war of resources in the 19th century – as well as a desire to re-shut the Pacific.
These desires may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia is waiting for an international court ruling that should fall on 1 October after five years of negotiation.
"Polivia has energy, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, expects a positive result," says Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the MSD on large screens throughout the country, with the hope that the Hague tribunal will decide for the benefit of Bolivia's claim that, after many decades of interrupted talks, Chile must act to give Bolivia a sovereign approach to the sea.
The charismatic indigenous President of Bolivia Evo Morales – who faces a controversial battle to re-election next year – is also very interested in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court should decide for Bolivia’s benefit – and even if it did, the power would not change.
This UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to tell anyone about Chile's territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of the possible interviews.
The fact that the decision of the MSD comes only six months after the latest arguments have been made shows that the case “was not complicated”, according to Paz Zárate, Chilean law expert.
And for the last four years, not only did they not support the Bolivia thing, but they might have slowed it down.
"The current Bolivian government has been strengthened on issues of access to the sea," says Zárate.
He adds that Morales' attack rhetoric has weakened all Chile's remaining good will.
Bolivia and Chile will once again start to act, but after this it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
Both countries have not replaced the ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions were unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement with each other's advantages," he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – would use the question of the sea as a political crutch.
"Polivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless the U.S. can believe it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people will never arm their nuclear weapons first if they can't trust Washington
Ri spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to make promises made at the summit of leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after it seems that US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo is about to restart nuclear diplomacy that has stuck to the dead point for more than three months for Singapore meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a “planning of hope” that the ongoing sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration ending the Korean war could at times bring the North to its knees.
Washington is careful about agreeing to the declaration if Pyongyang does not first take significant steps to disarm.
Kim and the President of the United States want a second summit.
However, there is general skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Trump's second summit.
Paris shows that the latest trend of huge headgears will soon reach your fashion stores
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is over.
The designers Valentino and Thom Brown discovered a number of shrunken giant head covers for their spring/summer 2019 collection at a show that captured everyone at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer and these designers sent their exciting creations to the pier.
The exhibition piece from Valentina was an overcrowded beige hat with a wide margin similar to the feathers, which flooded the heads of the model.
The other excessively large accessories were decorated melons, a witch hat and even pineapple – but they are not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have sewn lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One creature recalled diving equipment with snorkels and glasses, while another looked like a root with melted ice cream.
And if you continue with a great fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats could even reach fashion shops.
The overgrown hats come after La Bomba, a half-foot straw worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this very impractical hat, which flooded the social media, sent another huge creation to the exhibition pier – a straw beach bag, which is almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that carries it.
The dark orange Rafi bag laminated with Rafi shakes and the white leather handle was on Paris Fashion Week with the exhibition piece of the La Riviera spring/summer 2019 collection from Jacquesmus.
Stylist of Celebrity Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores next summer – given that the designer has been so successful with them, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for excessively large supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a number of academic achievements and it continues with other excellent test results in 2018. Individual and group successes in sports, art, music and other community activities only undermine this.
These schools have more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and try to provide their pupils and parents with the best possible level of service.
Independent schools prepare their pupils for further and higher education, the career they choose, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement individually adapted school curricula, we observe that modern languages in schools are still popular and desirable subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, it goes directly to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart."
It is a significant observation that if we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries, we cannot rely on English alone.
The latest results of this year's tests show that languages are at the top of the boards, with no higher degree of success being achieved by independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of pupils who learned a foreign language achieved the best sign of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that the highest grade A reached 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as subjects selected by pupils are as much regarded in the study plans of independent and other schools as STEM subjects (sciences, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
The survey carried out by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for reasons that employers consider to be problems in the establishment of vacancies, 17 per cent of the language skills are insufficient.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future career.
Since more and more jobs require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whether a person chooses any career, if he learns another language, he will in the future have the real advantage of having such a lifelong ability.
Using the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, one automatically gains more languages than competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent of them could not speak foreign language well enough to have conversation, with the only language spoken by the two-digit percentage of people, namely 15%, being French.
Therefore, it is important for today’s children to invest in language education.
If children learn more languages, especially languages developing economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs from the language it teaches.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom in terms of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have in independent schools a selection of several languages with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scotland’s independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that children prepare and provide them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what awaits them in the future.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that languages are essential for the future of the country in a global business environment, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be seen as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will be introduced to San Diego on Sunday for the first time in Lakers' jersey
The fans who are looking forward to LeBron James for the first time in Los Angeles Lakers will be waiting soon.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will be playing in Sunday's preseason game in San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after training, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the pre-season.
"At this stage of my career I do not need pre-seasonal matches," he said.
Trump's West Virginia performance, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch a wave of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five estates scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the suspension of the vote on the confirmation of his candidate for vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to receive support for the upcoming election in half the mandate, as the Republic stands in the November elections ahead of the risk of losing Congress.
What time does Trump's performance begin tonight, and how can you watch him online?
Trump's Wheeling Assembly in West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 Eastern Time, today on Saturday 29 September 2018.
Trump's estate in West Virginia you can watch online below through live YouTube transmission.
Trump will probably be talking about hearing the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh this week and was very tense about the allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, and the Senate's confirmation vote is expected to be postponed by a week before the FBI investigation takes place.
But the main goal of this wave of possessors is to help the Republicans gain momentum before the November elections.
According to Reuters, campaign organisers President Trumpa say that these five meetings next week aim to "add energy to volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives".
"The control of the Senate is so important for its agenda that the President will go to this busy season campaign in as many states as possible," Reuters spokeswoman Trump's campaign, who did not wish to be appointed, said.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters from Ohia and Pennsylvania could come to the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and be followed by the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday it will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, in which he received more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate to the Senate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the President must come to help him in the polls,” says a political scientist at the University of West Virginia Simon Haeder, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team has shown that his stomach is fighting to keep hope from Sunday singles
After three unilateral games, Saturday couples can be exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
A swinging pendulum is a completely fabricated sports concept, but players really believe it, and most precisely at such competitions.
So where's the pendulum going to go now?
"They had six points and now they're four, so let's take it so that the pendulum probably moves a little towards us," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, leads by four points, and there are twelve remaining.
As Spith says, Americans feel they have a bit of wind in their sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as the form of Spithe and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and everyone can boast three points out of four.
Spith was a mortal at the turn of the firing range to green, and he's an example.
The festive screams still grew in the continuation of his bike when he managed a key path to win the whole match when they were with Thomas two holes behind.
His path, which won them a 15-hole match, met with a similar roar that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," said Spith.
That's all any of these players left behind.
18 holes for leaving a trail.
The only players with more points than Spith and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undeniably the main story of Ryder Cup.
Weird, but adorable couples from Europe are four out of four, and they can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit the hole on Saturday afternoon, but also passed Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again Friday morning."
This course and the way energy flows towards a stormy audience, it confirms from him that these are players destined for Sunday's victory, and that in the sunset over Le Golf National there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Best both at the same time to a different hole.
But things about European glory remain premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson worked briefly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning game of four balls when he was paired with Alex Noreen.
A cave and two logs on the front nine buried Spain and Sweden in a abyss from which they no longer climbed.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you.
Two pair games on two balls are so fascinating when you closely monitor interactions between people in pairs, advice they give themselves, advice they don't give themselves, and the way a strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a sharp turn until the last day, but this game of two couples has also shown that the US team has a stomach for fighting, which some, in particular from the States, doubted.
To the final day of Ryder Cup Europe leads with a score of 10-6 points
Europe gains a healthy advantage until the last day of Ryder Cup then from Saturday double games to two balls came with a head start of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who allegedly won almost twice over the struggling Tiger Woods, decided to make four in Le Golf National.
The European party with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine, dominated two American-party balls in the early games, which failed in series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, won two matches, but couldn't get into the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12th fights to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points behind, while he and Molinari, who, after a sensational weekend, got the nickname "Milliwood", are only the second couple to win four points from their four opening matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
After the defeat of the Woods players and Patrick Reed in a two-ball game, they beat the tired Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more prominently.
Woods, which lasted two games on Saturday, showed occasional brilliance flashes, but now lost 19 of his 29 games in doubles for two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after the morning game on two balls, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in a 2-1 double game to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the 1st and 3s in the world ranking.
But Europe did not win the entire line on this pleasant day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time top winner Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas took out two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a rough 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a two-ball game and came back later to defeat two Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4-3 in a pair game, despite losing two first holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup is the team returning from a four-point deficit to a two-game, although as defending Fury's side only needs a draw to win a trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, it seems Sunday's counterattack is behind them.
North Korea says that “in no way ” will be disarmed unilaterally and without trust
The Secretary of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday that the continuing UN sanctions have deepened their distrust of the United States and under such circumstances the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual general meeting that North Korea had adopted “significant goodwill measures” in the past year, such as nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see an appropriate response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible to disarm itself unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about the resistance of Washington to a “progressive” approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea would have been rewarded for every step of the way, his statement appeared to be significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation only because Phongjang had already gone through it in the past.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Chong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to work on the "denocularization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump pledged guarantees of security to North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 war conflict, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must surrender its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls for the release of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The US insists on “denocularisation of the first” and raises pressure on sanctions to force its objectives and even oppose the “declaration of the end of the war”,” Ri said.
“I feel that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader stressed in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea and not the United States were to side with this issue of denuclearisation, denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a pathetic situation.”
However, Rio's speech was dramatically different from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that the focus of North Korea's missiles on the territory of the United States was inevitable after Mr. Trump named Kim "the rocket man" as a suicide mission.
This year at the UN Trump, which threatened “total destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work must be done and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is fully denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame, saying: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, however, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "Promoting the Security Council's sanctions must continue vigorously and without ceasing until we are aware of the complete, final, verified denuclearisation"
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to curb the financing of nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly on the side and Pompeo announced that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July and declared that progress had been made, only to be reported within hours by North Korea as a “gangster requirement”.
This month, North Korea committed itself to meeting Moon to dismantle the missile area and also the nuclear complex, if the United States takes “corresponding measures”.
He told him that Kim had announced that the “measures that he hoped” were security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore and was heading towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to teach them to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has brought all of its students to sleep more, trying to fight the growing macho culture after the entire night when students do not sleep and encourage caffeine.
The academics found that students at the world's most famous university are often helpless when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and a woman hospital, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to begin the course after teaching about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of me a girl came to me and said, ‘Why do you say this to me just now, in my last year?’ ”
She said that no one has ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he said for The Telegraph.
The course that was first introduced this year explains how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of medical services at the university, said that the university decided to establish a course after finding that students were really sleepless during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part is a picture of student colleges where students click on cups with coffee, curtains, sneakers and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In another part, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know - as well as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," added Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride in "studying all night" still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation also increases.
Enough good quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of a student to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even so as not to be gained because sleep deprivation switches the brain to a hunger regime, so that man is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler design a course that one of his classes graduated from Harvard during last year's first year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the entire course.
He hopes that the next step he will ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering a competitive institution.
The professor recommended that students consider setting the alarm for the time when to go to bed as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can decide your circadian rhythm, which leads to problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal sunk Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Mengy found Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with the 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox tried to record his first victory from February 4th to February 1st triumph at St Johnstone, but the team of Gary Holt only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a manager to leave his post eight points from the leading leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before the half-time and the Rangers' assembly seemed without inspiration and determination to settle.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and right behind the Hibernian team in contrast to one goal.
And there might be further problems for Rangers after having to be treated with a head injury after apparently hit by an object from the auditorium.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side, which went too far around Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who last week picked up the Hearts point and would be happy to see how his well-trained men strangled their rivals at every turn.
Rangers may have controlled the hold, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were only supposed to score two minutes after Menga first released Scott Pittman at Allan McGregor's goal, but the publisher buried his big chance.
The distant free kick of Keaghana Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only try at the back post.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt he should have had a quarter-hour penalty when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but Judge Steven Thomson threw the Colombian challenge out of the table.
The Rangers only managed two shots at the target in the first half, but former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by Lassana Coulibala and by a gentle shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener could have been against the run of the game after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they've earned it already.
The Rangers failed to deal with the deep Jacobs set again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and took Menga for an easy finish.
During the break, Gerrard took action and exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had almost an immediate result when the wing crashed into Morelos, but impressive Kelly broke through from the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into the game exactly the kind that they like when Lithgow and Halkett threw one long ball after another.
Holt's party could have deepened its lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran out of the corner.
Deputy Rangers Glenn Middleton had another late sentence when he got mixed up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
Almanach: Inventor of Geiger's Reader
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years old, and it is still coming... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as Geiger's reader.
At that time Geiger Counter became a permanent pop culture, as in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado”, in the main role of the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger reader used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really hear the effects of atoms emitted by radiation in minerals.
Evans: "Yeah, now it's really scratching!"
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945 just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see ” dangerous cells and kill them.
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into a laboratory
Then they can “see” the protein that is common to many cancers, and then the noodle is re-injected.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
One woman treated with a vaccine who teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells has lost ovary cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation into the laboratory, so they can “see” the regular protein in many cancers called HER2 and then re-apply to the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “drives the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immunodeficiency cells were collected from patients and “teached” them to target cancer cells, was already being promoted in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West took part in the pro-trump sermon in his maga cap after his performance at the SNL.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was printed in Saturday Night Live after a confused performance, during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore the Make America Great Again hat, he began swimming on Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump, is he a racist?’”
If I bothered with racism, I wouldn't be in America long ago," he said.
SNL started a show of parody with Matte Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee about the charges of rape against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the images of West's theatrical speech were recorded on social media by Chris Rock.
It's not clear that Rock was trying to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience that his head ornament had been eaten up in the backstage.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat."
It's chicane!
They also said I'm in the wrong place," said Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" and added that he would "put on his superman suit because that means you can't say what to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments only served a noisy audience at least twice, and the SNL members looked offended, in despair, says Variety, and one person even said: “The whole studio has gone silent. ”
West was called in as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many people by singing a song I Love disguised as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from TPUSA’s conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest characters: I THANK YOU THAT THE SEC HAS GRANTED DAVA."
But visiting talk show Karen Hunter on Twitter wrote that West “was simply who he is, and that is absolutely amazing. ”
“But I DON’T WANT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “art”), of which I believe he represents and sends to the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
Just like us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow up on Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and, of course, the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.

Game Thrones star Kit Harington is released into toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is famous for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in hand in the violent medieval fantasy HBO series.
The actor, 31 years old, however, emerged from the macho hero stereotype and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be claimed to earn respect.
News The Sunday Times Culture Kit said he believed that “something was wrong” and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his star, Rose Leslie’s throne, also 31, admitted that the problem was “very strongly expressed. ”
"At the moment I feel personally, quite strongly - what happened to masculinite so bad?" he said.
“What are we teaching a teenager about the problem we are seeing here?”
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity thanks to its very male characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What do boys learn on television, on the streets, in which they grow the feeling that every man needs to have such a page?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do you change that?
Because young men have certainly changed to worse.
In the interview he also admitted that he would not play in any prequel or sequel of the Games about the throne after finishing the series, because he has had enough “fights and horses”.
Since November Kit will be playing in the restored Right West of Sam Shepard, who is the story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently discovered that meeting with his current wife, Rose, was the best thing out of the Throne Game.
“I met my wife while filming the show, so he gave me my future family and my whole subsequent life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of love by Kit's character Jon Snow, in this fantasy series awarded by Emmy.
A couple were married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected by this virus in the country according to official numbers.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change against the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads across parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who infected HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, brought Chinese medics to a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people year-on-year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is reportedly still widespread.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are eventually married to women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these encounters.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV treatment as part of an effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff would avoid the data of the GOP senators, the terms “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theory” are on the line.
On Saturday, American Member Maxine Waters denounced the claim that a member of her employees had sent personal data to three Republican American senators to the legislators' websites.
A Democrat in Los Angeles claimed that the charges were supported by "ultra-right" scientists and websites.
"Lies, lies and other contemptible lies," Waters said in her Twitter statement.
The information released reportedly included addresses of homes and phone numbers for American senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday on the Internet and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate's hearings on sexual abuse by candidate Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court.
There was a leak after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
A conservative site such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address, which is the source of the contributions, is connected to Waters and published information about Waters personnel, says Hill.
"This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
‘The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were at risk as a result of these fraudulent and false charges - was in no way responsible for the omission of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly received online criticism, including one from former White House Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that he has no temper to be a member of Congress."
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
He can't be resilient.
He must not question the defendant's motives.
He must be calm and not be disturbed."
It seemed that Fleischer compared the reaction of Waters to the criticism of Democrats towards Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized because he seemed too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who took part in the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters noted that her office had notified “the competent authorities and authorities involved in criminal proceedings against these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff."
Johnny English re-interprets reviews – weaker spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It is common to look for Brexit in any new film with British tendency, which seems to be the case of this re-enactment of Johnny English in the series of action parodys - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this bold satire on the subject of how obviously the bad nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this twisted, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to re-pack things in a completely new way - this name is more than any other signal that it is a wide comedy design designed for a non-English speaking cinematographic audience.
Of course, he's the dumb secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a hint of Mr Bean, and a big touch of that guy who stuck the only tone in the Chariots of Fire's soundtrack at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in London.
The character is also originally based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson once played in Barclaycard’s already forgotten TV commercials, which left behind chaos.
In this last edition, is found one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in medieval armor, and the blades of the rotor spoke briefly about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is displayed, but humor feels quite sub-dimensional and strangely redundant, especially when the “serious” film brands like 007 and Mission Imposible themselves now offer comedy as a sure component of their production.
Humor is more like directed to children than adults, and to me are the foolish trampos of Johnny English as resourceful and focused as Atkinson's silent film gags in Mr. Bean's person.
The current assumption is that Great Britain has serious problems.
A cyber hacker infiltrated a British super-secret spy network and discovered the identity of all British agents in the field, to frighten an agent on the job - a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and busy figure who is already suffering from a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson this lovebird Theresa May plays as best as she can, but there is not much in the script.
Her intelligence advisors will inform her that once each of her active spies is threatened, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means Johnny English himself, who is now employed as director at some luxury facility, but at the same time teaches a record lesson about how to be a secret agent: there are a few nice gags because English offers a spy academy similar to Rock School.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency britches and met with his long-awaited partner Bough, who was once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the commander of the submarine, an effective figure, on which Vicki Pepperdine's talent may even be a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back in action to meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously subject to the charm of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the vicious Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey full of frakking palates: disguises as waiters light up a French restaurant; they create chaos when they sneak onto the deck of Voltov's luxury yachts; and English launches a clean anarchy when they try to get acquainted with Volt's interior with the virtual reality of the house.
I'm sure all essays are ready for this last sequence, but whatever is kind and stormy, it's got something on baby TV.
It's kind of a temperamental thing.
And like the other movies of Johnny English, I couldn't help but think: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
Labour deny that they would develop a plan for the English to work four days a week to get paid in five days
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and get paid in five days.
The Party allegedly wants the management companies to hand over savings to workers resulting from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
The employees would enjoy a weekend of class, but they'd still be getting the same reward.
Sources argue that this idea would “fit” into the economic agenda of the party and plan to favour the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changing economies.
A longtime member of the Labour Force said for the Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that falls into the side's positions to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support this idea, the Green Party pledged a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
The speaking Labour Party said: “The week of work is not the policy of our party and the party does not take it into account.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a work conference last week to fill his vision of the Socialist Revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to return energy from "anonymous directors" and "acquaintances" in the utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies do not have to return to their total share, as the laborist government could carry out “decreases” on the basis of perceived guilt.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on the company's boards and to create own ownership funds that transfer 10% of private equity to employees entitled to payment of annual dividends up to a maximum of £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said on the show "60 minutes" whether the FBI Kavanaugh investigation could change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least a week, and raises the question of whether the findings of the Office could push some Republican senators to seek their support.
In an interview from Sunday’s “60 minutes” correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could reveal anything that would change their mind.
Kennedy looked more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened when the charge came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal."
However , Graham’s decision is unshakable .
"I have already made my decision over Brett Kavanaugh, and it would mean a really explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she named could verify that.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changes."
What is Global Citizens Festival and what has he done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizens Festival, which offers a very impressive range of stars and an equally impressive mission beyond the end of world poverty, will be held in New York City.
The Global Citizens Festival in its seventh year will welcome tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only such artists as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizens Festival, which was launched in 2012, is the expansion of Global Poverty, an international group to support the end of poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to be able to obtain a free ticket to the event (if you were not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, email to the world leader, call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before reaching his goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with free concert really in the way they are convinced to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel that by signing an online petition or leaving tweet, something changes?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, he has recorded more than 19 million “actions” by his supporters, trying to achieve various goals.
It says that these actions have contributed to world leaders declaring commitments and measures of more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group announced 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, the British partnership of investors and realtors, which committed themselves to ‘helping children grow into their full potential’, promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end nutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens such as you, we can only make a point of social injustice in the form of nutrition in history,” the Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ulmanová told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions called on U.K. to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced the financing of the Power of Nutrition project, which will address 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on our website with a question, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty? ”
Global Citizine replied: “It will be a long and hard road — sometimes we fall and fail.
But like great civil rights and the movement against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among those who will host Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman this year.
The US could use a Navy for a “block” that would defend Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can “in case of need” resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke quoted Washington Examiner as saying.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where legitimate governments are invited - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy like in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the option of using our navy to make sure that the sea voyages are open and blocked, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not go to market," he said.
Zinke addressed participants in an event organised by the consumer energy alliance, a nonprofit group that is considered in the US to be "the voice of the consumer of energy".
He compared Washington's approach and negotiations with Russia and Iran, and noted that they were practically the same.
"The economic potential for Iran and Russia is more or less an investment in or replacement of fuel," he said, while calling on Russia as a "single" player with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declaration comes because Trump's administration is on a mission to strengthen the export of its fossil gas to Europe and replaced Russia, which for European consumers is a much cheaper option.
To this end, Trump's administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to step down from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin "the hostages" of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline worth $11 billion, which is designed to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that the zealous opposition of Washington to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of an unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for developing pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The US took a stand from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's largest industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state intervenes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to look closely at the Presidential candidacy in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the mid-election elections, "closer" will look at the presidential candidacy.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for office.
"It is time for women to come to Washington and correct our broken government, including the highest female position," The Hill said.
"After November 6th, I will take a close look at the presidential candidacy."
During the meeting, Warren also mentioned Donald Trump and said that she is “leading this country in the wrong direction”.
“I’m afraid of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy until it gets to the core of my bones,” she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and his appointment as Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter: "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not think that they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the “probable” voters from Massachusetts said that the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent for the candidacy and 48 per cent against it.
Other highly-built democratic names discussed in connection with the potential candidacy by 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision in January, says Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palina at a meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year on the list in September in Iraq.
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
“What my own son is going through after his return may involve other families that feel the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning to," said the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest “the elephant in the room ” and said of her son and other war veterans that“ they return a little more, return healing, return and ask if there is any respect for the things their fellow soldiers and airmen and each other in the army give to their country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic assault on a woman, interfering with the report on domestic violence and holding a weapon intoxication, said Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the call for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal call for new measures by the US government, which deny asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the Washington district issued a short report to support and challenge asylum seekers, said the NBC.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was presented in August by the American Civil Liberties Organization against Federal Politics, was not revealed.
She said that her partner “and his sons and members of the violent gang” had abused her, but the American officials refused her asylum application on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as producing a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
A new asylum policy in the United States reversed the decision of the Board of Appeal for Migrants in 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of D.C. stated in his Friday statement that the new measure "ignorates a decade of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," said a short friend.
Lawyers also briefly argued that policies that deny the entry of immigrants are damaging the US economy and that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and “add the necessary work”.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum in June to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azil is available for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or because of political opinion," said Sessions in its statement of 11 June.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palo, where the number of victims has already doubled, race for survivors over time
The situation was worse and worse for the survivors.
“It’s very tense,” said 35 - year - old Risa Kusum, who comforted her feverish little boy at the evacuation center in the dry city of Pal.
“Every minute, the ambulance will bring more bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking through the wetlands and trying to save whatever they find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that were destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 were crippled.
Some injuries, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a fracture of his spine and shoulder, rested at Palu’s army hospital, where patients were treated outside for continued severe subsequent concussions.
Tears filled his eyes as he reflected the feeling that a violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which shared peace with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I was dragged into the ruins of the wall," Harris told Associated Press and added that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife called for help, but then quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're all right."
US ambassador accuses China of "scrambling" propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese daily published a four-page advertisement in the American daily, which focused on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the American ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday's payment of China Daily's fee in Des Moines' register - the state of the largest sales newspaper in Iowa - after he accused China of trying to interfere with the US congressional elections in the USA on 6 November.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in American elections marked what American officials said Reuters was a new phase of escalating campaign by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to introduce commercial promotion advertisements, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war that is manifested at the level of mutual imports.
China's legal sanctions at the beginning of the commercial war were proposed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's republican side, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, American ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in his opinion in Sunday's Des Moines Register that China is now doubling this bully by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free printing by placing paid advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in a newspaper stand on the street in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting votes and you will not see any real reflection of the unnatural views that the Chinese might have on the disturbing economic path of China, given that the media belongs to the company ‘China Communist Party’, he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers refused to publish its article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
Republicans abandon their constituents to elections for debacle with Kavanaugh, warn analysts
As many top Republicans defend the candidate for Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several sexual assault charges, the analyst warned that during the upcoming mid-term elections, they would learn a response, especially from women.
The emotions surrounding this case were extremely high, and most of the republicans on the record are already saying they want to continue the vote.
These things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would last-minute pursue an FBI investigation to calm the voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor November," said Karina Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and spokesman of the progressive group MoveOn, the newspaper in D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors chanted "November is approaching!" at a demonstration in the Senate Hall, where the Republicans in charge of the judicial commission decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records," said Stu Rotenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it was already high, that's true."
However, this could be higher, especially between women who hesitate to vote in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, although they do not like the president, but often do not go to elections."
Even before Ford's public testimony, detailing her accusation of sexual assault on the highest court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, resistance could follow.
"He got rid of this confused mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just the vote in the committee or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh will sit on the table, it is also about how the Republicans have handled it and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the US priority, a group that helps elect Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided in the view of who to believe in the light of the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, with somewhat more sympathy for the second appointed.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents have definitely or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent have claimed that Kavanaugh is, or probably, trusted.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from the Flako FBI, he is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet and run Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Open Source platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the Inrupt project was aimed at “world domination”.
"We have to do it now," he said about this startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or SD.
It may contain lists of contacts, list of tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Disk Google, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and in all simultaneously.
What is remarkable about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data. ”
According to the Director-General of John Bruce, the Inrupt project aims to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills in order to help the Solid platform be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some employees working on the project cooperated on the project and community of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, technological developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on Inrupt websites.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with “Facebook and Google do not talk about introducing a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We do not ask their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in his paper on the media published on Saturday that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will become founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a clergyman who received Victoria's Cross during World War I
A hundred years have passed since the only spiritual Church of England won Victoria's cross during World War I as a warrior.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaukourt.
Four days later, however, the shooter killed him, and he never found out that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandkids revealed a memorial stone to him at the Rushden festivities on Saturday.
One of his great - grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “genially symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s victory.
According to the London Gazette of September 29, 1918, Lt Col Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very thick fog and heavy shooting from Polish cannons and machine guns."
Later he reached the first line and with “the highest courage” led the line forward until he threw himself into the field of fire and knocked three separate units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was killed by a German shooter on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
72 - year - old Michael Vann said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do, but at the same time something that was humiliating. ”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band youth group, they laid a wreath.
Michael Vann said that he “felt great honor for being able to participate in the show, ” adding that“ the courage of the true hero is being shown by the support that many people will have. ”
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa's pig.
Imagine, you've been waiting all night to watch the stupid Bellator 206, just to be denied the main event.
The bill from San José contained 13 points, including six on the main card and live broadcasts in the United Kingdom all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's games, viewers in the United Kingdom remained amazed when the news broadcasts changed to the Pepp Pig Show.
Some remained unsettled after watching for the fight until the early morning hours.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change in the show for children as "a certain form of bad joke."
"It is therefore not appropriate to send children's shows at 6 a.m. under the government regulation," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for marketing and communication to Bellator after being questioned about this transmission.
"Peppa's Bug," yes.
Bellator President Scott Coker said he would be working on the program so that future audiences in the UK would be involved.
"I think that when I think about broadcasting, we can probably handle it," said Cooker.
"But there's six o'clock Sunday morning and we can't do it until Sunday of our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of texts going on back and forth, and not all of them were very friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was the government's fault.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We reduce it to five games instead of six – as we normally do – and we tried to keep the promises made to fans and failed to do so.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “lower” because of sexuality
The Olympic Jumper in the Water Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but it motivated him to follow success.
A 24 - year - old athlete said that he did not realize that “not everyone is like him. ”
On the first disk Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, presented by Lauren Laverne, said that he spoke aloud about gay rights to give others “hope. ”
He also said that due to his ability to become a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular moderator for the long-term Kirsty Young show had several months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a midwife in Laverne’s first program, said that he felt “less” than anyone else who had grown up with him because“ it was not socially unacceptable for you boys and girls to like. ”
He said: “So far, these feelings of inferiority and differentity have been the real things that have given me strength and power to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone, ” he said, not to disappoint anyone who would eventually find out what his sexuality was like.
The dual holder of the bronze Olympic Medal became a fighter for LGBT rights with a high profile and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had responded because he felt lucky that he could live openly without consequences and wanted to give others “hope. ”
This threefold world champion said that he was in love with a man – American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “found himself unprepared.”
Daley took the Oscar holder, who is 20 years older, last year took it, but said that age difference was never a problem.
“If you experience so much at a young age – he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died three years later of cancer – he said it was not easy to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar rises and falls.
Two in June adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley said that "the whole point of view has changed."
"If you asked me last year, it would be all in style "I want to get a gold medal," he said.
“You know, there are more things than the gold medals of the Olympics.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011, 40 years after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said his father couldn't bear to die, and the last thing he asked was if they had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him – you won't be first, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and until the moment he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized he was not invincible," he said.
The year Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that I had dreamed about this my whole life – jumping in front of our housemen at the Olympic Games, I don't know better feeling," he said.
It also inspired the selection of his first composition – the stream from Heather Small – which resonated with him at the beginning of the Olympics and kept causing goose skin in him.

Mickelson, who was out of shape, ended up on a bench Saturday at Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson would have won the record on Sunday when he played 47, Ryder Cup, but he'd have to tune out the form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played on events held every two years on double-twenty, sent Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's furballs and fursoms to the bench.
Instead of being in the center of the event, as was often the case in the United States, a five - time winner spent his day alternately between cheerleaders and a game in a row he hoped would fix what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old player has never been the straightest of drivers, even at the top of his career, so it is not the ideal choice for the narrow playground Le Golf National, where the long-joint terrain routinely punishes stray arrows.
And if the golf course isn't self-concerned enough about itself, it faces Mickelson in the ninth Sunday match to the exact British Open Francesco Molinari, who won all four of his matches this week on the new Tommy Fleetwood team.
If the Americans, who had four points less, had started 12 separate swords, had avoided a rapid onset, Mickelson's sword could have proved to be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed his trust in his husband, and he didn't say anything else.
"He totally understands the role he played today, pats me on the back, puts his hand around my shoulder and says he will be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He believes so much.
He's a member of the Sina of straw, and in the past, even this week, he's been so helpful to these teams.
I guess I couldn't imagine him playing two swords.
I imagined more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Falda's record in most of the west of Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mean the end of a career in Ryder Cup, which has never reached the height of its individual record.
Mickelson scored 18 wins, 20 loses and seven drawbacks, even though Furyk says that his presence to the team brought some tangible results.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to make fun of people and is a great companion in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed the fun of going to see him this week, which was fun to observe.
It gives a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, from experience knows that the great leadership heading towards the singles of the last days at Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Data debuted in 1997 in Valderram, where a team led by Captain Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but reached the finish line with a total victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You have to keep reminding yourself that in Valderram we had a big head start, as well as in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but only closely," said Bjorn, on the picture, after watching when in 2018 they won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, to Le Golf National leading 10-6.
So history and every member of that team has shown me that it's not behind us.
Tomorrow you'll be bored.
Go in there and do all the right things.
It's not behind you until all the points are on the board.
We have a target, and that's what we're trying to get the trophy, and that's what we're focused on.
I said I would focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand for on the other side – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, pleased with the way his players played on a complex golf course, added: “I could never do it on my own.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
Individual performances are being prepared tomorrow, and that's too hard.
It's great to be out with a partner when it's going well, but when you're there to be yourself, your golfer's capacity is fully verified.
That's the message you have to deliver to the players, get the best of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he has to go and get the best of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players play better as individuals than as partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these big twists when he was part of a winning team in Brooklyn to end up defeated when Europe reached the "Miracle in the Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, encouraged his players to move to the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you would like to start quickly like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When this pace goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those mid-games.
According to this, we've set up the assembly and made sure that the boys feel as you know, as if we were going to magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the attack and to stand up to Rory McIlroy in the top match with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the upper half.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think it covers the whole way, Bjorn said about his choice of singles.
Germany's new warship is still suspended
The latest German sea frigate was recognised in 2014 to replace the ageing warships of the Cold War era, but will not be available for at least one year due to faulty systems and snowy coasts, local media report.
The operation of the leader of the ship ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, a brand new frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019 according to Die Zeit's citing speaking army.
The vessel was to become part of the Navy in 2014, but the difficult problems following the delivery made the fate of this ambitious project uncomfortable.
Four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will serve as replacement for the ageing frigates of the Bremen class, which the Navy ordered in 2007.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important functions include a long maintenance period – the latest frigates should be available for up to two years outside the domestic port.
However, constant delays mean that the top seaships – which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces to the overseas – will be obsolete by the time they are put into operation, notes Die Zeit.
The famous F125 frigate got into the paper last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the manufacturer after the transfer.
Few were known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of fundamental “soft errors and faults on metal elements” that would make warship unusable during combat.
Software failures were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessel will operate some 120 sailors – half the workers who were needed in the Bremen class frigates.
It has also proved to be of considerable overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the ability of the Navy to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7 000-ton ship Rheinland-Pfal will be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the flaws on metal elements, the price of the entire project – including training of the crew – is a problem.
It is said that from the original EUR 2.2 billion, the price has risen to EUR 3.1 billion.
Problems with the most recent frigates have become of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is declining.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, confirmed that the naval army is indeed "coming ships capable of deployment."
This representative said that the problems were constantly packed because the old ships were excluded from operation but no replacements were provided.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could become part of the Navy's equipment.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
New research is being carried out at the headquarters of bats on the Highlands of Scotland to discover how bats use landscapes to hunt food.
There is hope that the discovery of research will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help to manage future activities to preserve this species.
A study carried out by National Trust for Scotland scientists will watch bats whistling and the smallest and brown long and watery in the botanical garden of Inverew Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special records will be placed in key areas in this bat habitat, which will monitor the activities of bats throughout the entire annual period.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The professional sound analysis of all recordings shall determine the frequency of the call of bats and what each species does.
Next will be the map of habitat and message that creates a detailed landscape image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural resource consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are most important for bats and how individual species use them.
This information will help to identify the advantages of working to manage habitats, such as the creation of a meadow, and the best way to maintain forested areas for bats and other related species.
The bats of the population in Scotland and the whole of Britain in the past century have been largely lost.
They are at risk as a result of construction and development affecting colonies and natural environments.
Risks can also represent wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatment of construction materials and cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
But because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful when hunting than their eyes.
They use a clever echo-location technique to track bugs and flight barriers.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of soil in the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly conduct research, colony control and sometimes rescue work.
This organization even established the first and only reserved bats in the Thrave headquarters in Dumfries and Galloway, home of eight out of ten bats in Scotland.
David Thompson, the manager of the residence, says that this is the ideal territory for them.
"We have a great area for bats here in Threeave," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there's still too much we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand better what they need to survive."
It emphasises the importance of checking bats before starting maintenance work in properties, as it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one mother's nest can kill up to 400 females and cubs, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass, disrupt or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to attach their hand to the work and help.
She said: “We need to learn a lot about our bats and a lot of species that we don’t know how their populations are doing. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges and his lawyers are about to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo cited the rape charges as “false reports ” and said that people“ want to make themselves known ” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German daily Der Spiegel, who informed of these charges.
This Portuguese and the gunman for Juventus was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $375 000 to keep the case quiet, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the release of the indictment, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million trackers and labeled information as "false news".
‘No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-time winner of the Golden Ball Award in camera.
“They want to live on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I am happy and I am fine," said the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, the lawyers are going to sue the daily Der Spiegel of the unsubstantiated charges, which they described as “unacceptable private suspicions. ”
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would require compensation for “moral damage in the amount of the corresponding seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times”.
The alleged incident was scheduled to take place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel suite and at a casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the playroom, where allegedly, according to the documentation filed at the Clark County District Court district in Nevada, he raped her annally.
According to Mayorga, after the alleged incident, Ronaldo kneeled down and told her that he was “99 percent” of the “clads” and “one percent” of the disappointments.
The papers say Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also declares that she went to the police and let her take photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an extraordinary settlement because she “had fear of retaliation” and was afraid of “public humiliation”.
A 34-year-old woman claims to be attempting to reinstate the procedure because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronalda at the time of the attack steps from moving to the Real Madrid Club from Manchester United and this summer he was bought by the famous Italian club Juve.
Brexit: Great Britain will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
Great Britain “will always regret it,” if after Brexit it loses its status as world leader in car manufacturing, said Greg Clark's secretary.
He added that it was “unsettling” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain had left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily have stopped production in the Burnaston race, near Derby.
"The deal is necessary," said Clark.
The Japanese car stated that if the Brexit agreement is not concluded, the impact of the delay on the border could become employment.
In a race in Burnaston, where Auris and Avensis brand Toyota are manufactured, almost 150,000 cars were produced last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would notice a halt in production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other cars, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the United Kingdom, spread fear of leaving the EU without agreement as regards the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW states that it will close its Mini car production plant in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers refer to as risks to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line is in operation on the basis of ‘right time’ deliveries, with parts from suppliers in the UK and the EU being supplied for cars manufactured for order within 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be a breach at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of spare parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to have more than one day in stock in the Derbyshire plant, stated the company, and thus would have stopped production.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plans to revive future relations with the EU are "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks."
“We need a deal. We want the best trade that will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also the understanding of this opportunity,” Radio 4's Today said in the BBC programme.
"The proof not only from Toyota but also from other producers is that we must be absolutely able to continue in what is a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production would be stopped, but warns from a long-term perspective that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and would ultimately be at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been in the Burnaston race for 24 years and has been the chairman of the trade unions in the race, said that the members of the trade organisation are increasingly concerned: “I have the experience that as soon as these places disappear, they will never return.
The speaking government said: "We have set up a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The meeting of Donald Trump at a high level with the representative attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “removed for the next week” as he continues to fight for the post of Supreme Judge with Brett Kavanaugh, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein sees to the work of Robert Mueller's special council, who investigates interference in Russian elections, links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and possible judicial obstructions by the President.
Have Trump release the deputy general and thereby threaten Mueller's independence, Washington gossip has been fed up with it for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times daily reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a camera to record conversation with Trump and the possibility of meeting the President through 25.
Rosenstein denied it.
Last Monday, however, he arrived at the White House surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, on Thursday, a meeting with Trump was announced, which was at the United Nations home in New York.
Trump declared that Rosenstein would not "advise" but then the meeting was delayed, so that she would not hesitate to hear from the Senate Judicial Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI's weekly investigation into Kavanaugh's charges, which delayed the Senate's full vote again.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Sunday on the Fox Channel.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “There has not been a date yet set, it may be this week, and it may be necessary to move for another week, taking into account everything else that is going on in the highest court.
But we'll see, and I'll always communicate up-to-date information to the media."
Some reporters disagree: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were caused by an aversion to the “diversity” of television reporters, even though she said: “I disagree with the fact that they will come out. ”
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President is holding more meetings with questions and answers than any president before him," she added, without giving evidence. "We looked at the numbers."
Conferences will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press representatives had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying and you've seen that we've been doing this in the last few weeks and that a press conference will be held where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visiting seniors.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the gathered reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland not to fear Brexit
The Ministry of Health wrote to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and their wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman’s SMEs sent a letter not even six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to meeting the costs of requests for settlement of EU citizens working in translated public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “This summer the negotiations between the UK and the EU continue on their retreat, and they are moving towards the expected decision this autumn.
However, the British Government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible margin scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reassure you again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and outside the EU bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit both patients and communities to which we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and our wish for you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie progresses emergency surgery after head injury
Elevated Tigers from Tennessee Christion Abercrombie proceeded an emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury in Saturday's defeat 31-27 from rival Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the side line and just collapsed there," Reed said.
The coaches and the medics gave Abercrombie on the side line of oxygen and then put him on the stretchers and prepared for further assessment.
A member of Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had performed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details of type/range of injury are yet available” and that Tennessee was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a pimp in a red shirt, graduates the first season for Tennessee after transfer from Illinois.
Before the end of the game on Saturday he had five overall interventions, which means a total of 18 interventions in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher property tax when buying properties in the UK
A higher property tax will be charged to the foreign buyer when he buys property in the United Kingdom, and the money will also be used to help the homeless under new Tory plans
This act will neutralize the success of Corby's move, whose aim is to attract young voters
An increase in the obligation of higher real estate taxes will apply to non-taxable persons in the United Kingdom
The State Treasury is expected to increase by £120 million per year to help people without a home
Buyers from abroad will pay higher taxes on property purchases when they purchase property in the United Kingdom, and the money will be used to help people without a home, Theresa Mayo will announce today.
This action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's success in attracting young voters with promises to provide affordable accommodation and focus on people with higher incomes.
The increase in property tax will be for individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and in addition the money strengthens the government's efforts to fight sleep without a roof over their heads.
An allowance that is an addition to the current obligation to pay the property tax, including higher levels established two years ago in other homes and purchases for rental purposes, may reach up to three percent.
It is estimated that up to £120 million per year will be raised in the Treasury.
Estimates say that newly built properties in London buy 13 percent of the citizens who are not residents of the United Kingdom, evading prices and making it easier for those who buy for the first time to get on the ladder home.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “spirit cities” precisely because of the high number of buyers from abroad who spend most of their time outside the country.
New principles emerged only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in property purchase tax to help more young people to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of holding property prices high by taking land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to withdraw the quotas from the affordable houses to correct the “inconvenient home” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a number of proposed housing reforms, including rent management and termination of “unusual” evictions.
He also wants to increase the powers of the committees to build new homes.
She said: “Last year I said that I wanted to devote my efforts as prime ministers to restoring the British dream — so that every new generation has a better life.
And that means repairing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and create life.
However, it cannot be right to make it easy for entities who do not live in Britain and for foreign companies to buy houses as well as hardworking residents of the United Kingdom.
For many people, the dream of their own home is too distant and the dull sleep without a roof over their heads is too real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to drive Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross states that it is his "highest ambition" to become Scotland's manager at a certain stage.
The 42-year-old Scott is looking forward to the challenge of restoring the Northeast Club, which currently stands third in the First League, only three degrees below the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after St Mirren brought back the League of Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play as a player in my country.
I got rank B and it was," Ross said on BBC Scotland's Sportssound channel.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampton with my dad when I was a kid, and that’s always something that brings me back.
Such an opportunity would come only if I had been successful in managing the club."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland's manager were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Chief Alloa Athletic says he felt no anxiety over following such established names in such a large club when he had previously refused foreplay from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“My success at that time would be measured by the question if I could return this club to Prime Minister League.
Because of the structure and equipment in this club undoubtedly belongs to Prime Minister League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to put him back there, but I guess I'd feel successful if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been in charge for three years, he's been acting as an assistant head in Dumarton for 15 months, and he's spent 15 months with Hearts coaches.
Then he helped Alloa to recover from the third group and transformed St Mirren from the beginning of the fall to the winner of the championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels much better now than he ever had in his career players at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” recalls the time when Alloa was taken.
“I really believed that leadership was right for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, making good money and enjoying reasonable heights.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I keep going through them from the stress and pressure of the job, but I just feel good about it in the lead.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, and I feel like I feel the most in my adult life right now."

Research found out that the perfect time on the pint is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer wind wave increased the income of British pubs facing difficulties, but increased pressure on the restaurant chain.
Numbers show that groups of pubs and bars recorded a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consulting company that created the final report, stated: “The stable sunlight and longer the expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, when the visits of pubs increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June has worsened in July.
At this point, pubs and pubs have been doing the same thing as restaurants have worsened.
The pubs, whose main markets are made of food, also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, the sales of beverages rose by 6.6 percent per month, while the sale of food decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, of an analytical leisure and hospitality company, stated: “These results have been a continuation of the trend since late April.
The weather and impact of significant social or sporting events are the greatest factors when it comes to selling outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that restaurant chains continue to fight, although each year’s decline in sales by 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in the light of ongoing costs pressures.
For a long hot summer, it can be no worse time for food-encouraging business operators and time to say whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring so much relief."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened restaurants, amounted to 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitor for the British sector of pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyses performance data from 47 operational groups with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, which is an established industrial scale in the sector.
Every fifth child has a secret account in social networks that hides from their parents.
Every fifth child – at only 11 years of age – has a secret account in social networks that hides from parents and teachers, shows research
Research among 20,000 high school pupils showed an increase in “false Instagram sites”
Reports raise fears that sexual content is published
Twenty percent of pupils said they had a “main ” account that their parents know about.
Every fifth child – at only 11 years of age – creates accounts in social networks that he hides from his parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in “false Instagram accounts ” shared by photographs.
Reports indicate fears that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the pupils said they had a beautiful “main ” account, which parents know about, and they also have a private account.
One mother who ran into her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret website found that her teenager was urging others to “rape them. ”
Research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters Association and the Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools showed that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, half admitting that they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" in the Scottish athletic committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual General Meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most prized lightweight athlete and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who are in the lead of sport such as those who will benefit from its far-reaching experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that for athletics in Scotland it will be very helpful if he is a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am excited to be the voice of athletes, and I hope to be truly helpful and to help lead a sport in Scotland. ”
An American who won 200 and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular BBC expert, he could not walk after a transitory ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I made an attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if I would recover or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've been fully healed, I've learned to walk again, and I'm doing my exercise today!
Thanks for all the encouraging news!"
Milk dispenser generating comparison of mothers to cows divides opinions online
The company involved in the production of sutures has distributed online opinion by advertising, which compares nursing mothers to lactating cows.
As part of the marketing of “the world’s first silent vacuum cleaners”, Envi’s consumer technology produced a music video showing the freedom that the new vacuum feeds to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of cows to a song with the lyrics: “Yes, I do, but you don’t see any tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed that I’m not pregnant, my breasts are here.”
The congregation continues: “Pump, pump, feed, pump, pump, feed my sweet milk. ”
The advertisement, which was published on the corporate facebook page, however, triggered online controversial reactions.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of them pointing out that it sheds light on the “hores ” of the dairy industry.
‘A very poor decision to abuse cows for advertising on this product.
Just like we have to be pregnant and give birth so they can give milk, but their children are taken a few days after birth," one comment says.
Elvie spraying is discreetly applied to breast-feeding (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: “Absolutely traumatic for mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise the breast pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Someone else added, "This commercial is totally off."
There were also those who defended the advertisement, one woman admitting that the song was considered “infectious. ”
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd get a pump if I'd still breast-feed.
I feel exactly like a cow when I'm sucking off.
Advertising's a little crazy, but it's up to the point.
It's a brilliant product," one user wrote.
She added: “It’s a fun commercial for mothers who suck milk (often at work or at a toilet) and feel like “cows. ”
It's not a commercial that's supposed to praise or damn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video shows a group of women dancing with discreet vacuum cleaners hidden under the bra.
The concept for the campaign is based on the observation that many women who suck milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s blowtorch is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and is beautifully hidden in the breast for breast-feeding, so that women are free to move, to hold the baby and even to walk while sucking.
Ana Balarin, a partner and an ECD for mothers, added: “Elvie’s spray is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a significant and provocative marketing.
By creating a parallel between nursing mothers and lactating cows, we wanted to point out the suckling of milk and all the challenges associated with it and to show a fun and reliable sense of freedom that the new mammal will ensure.
It's not the first time Elvie's blowout got on the eaves.
During the London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers of designer Marta Jakubowski appeared on the pier.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
Despite the fact that the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, the number of children detained by migrants has increased sharply, especially since the hard rhetoric and principles introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be escorted.
Most of the escorts were traditionally made up of immigrants without evidence who were afraid of threatening the opportunity to stay in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
Risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had requested the escort status of single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of the sponsor’s household are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to pursue them," said Mr. Albenz.
According to asylum workers, the representatives sought to deal with children more quickly with new rules that would require some of them to be brought before the court within a month before detention, instead of the previous 60 days.
Many appear by calling in the videoconference instead of personally declaring their case legal for an immigration judge.
Those who, according to the report, are not entitled to help will be deported quickly.
The longer the child is in custody, the more likely it is to experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to anger explosions or escape attempts, the asylum workers claim, and report from the system over the last few months.
Lawyers point out that these concerns are raised in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where there are signs that a child is suffering, with a greater likelihood of being overlooked, precisely because of the size of the device.
They added that moving children to a residential camp without enough time devoted to emotional preparation or farewell to friends could cause a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria announced that US, French, and Turkish "occupation" components should be withdrawn immediately
During the speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual also called after returning Syrian refugees home, even though the eighth year of the war has already taken place in the country.
Moal, who is also the prime minister, said that foreign forces in Syrian territory were illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that “that is according to what is being done. ”
"He must give up immediately and unconditionally," he said at the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terrorism in Syria is almost over”, with more than 360,000 people dead since 2011 and millions more lost their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue in “the battle of this holy battle until we rid all Syrian territory” of terrorist groups and“ any illegal foreigners”.
The United States has some 2,000 units in Syria that mostly train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 units in the territory of a war-torn country.
During the extradition of refugees, Moualem declared that the conditions for return were good for them and accused “some Western countries” of“ spreading irrational fears ” that caused refugees to refuse to return.
"We have addressed international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicise what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no assistance will be available for Syria to recover until there is a political agreement between the Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats state that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a protection zone at the last Idlib shelter has created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Syrian forces protected by Russia on the province where three million people live.
However, Moual pointed out that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front organization, with ties to Al-Qaeda, who would be "imposed".
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of the new committee, consisting of members of the government and the opposition, will soon be held to propose a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to “to the control of the articles of the current constitution” and issued a warning against the act.
Why Trump Wins in the Second Period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would have won other elections in 2020 if, as many liberal observers are likely to hope, the prosecution and scandals of his office as president did not end.
In that case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic final of the presidential period in history! ”
Until now, there are no signs of fatigue on the watch.
Since 2014, ratings in the main broadcast time have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million in the main broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago according to Nielsen and the Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC have increased surveillance on cable television to 3.5 million watching the main night reports.
“It’s the heat that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the operator of the “Designed Survival” programme at ABC drama about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, experienced author of comedy and show “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another theory.
He remembers driving by taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote Trump.
Why? She asked.
“He said, ‘Because he’s funny,’ said Mrs. Scovell.
It's the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story in Washington could predetermine the future of Roe v. Wada, regardless of whether the immigrant families can reconnect and benefit the global economy.
Dismantling is a luxury that only the most privileged watchers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being informed whether you are a citizen when you watch for six hours a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward uses "deep backup" resources for his book "Fear," the ostentatious skin coats of Paul Manafort worth US$ 15,000 (“arrogance clothing” as stated by Washington Post) and the consequences of Mr Trump Storm Daniels’ disgusting image of Mr Trump Storm.
I, among other things, will not look at Super Maria the same way again.
“The part of what he does and what causes a sense of reality is that he feeds you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the Pawn Stars document about the rotating N.F.L. Trump show in which Kim Chong-un values it.
You can't miss a single episode, or you'll be behind.
When I contacted Mr Fleiss this week, it was sunny out on the north coast of Kauai 80 degrees, but he was trapped inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't back off, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on the scales.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’ Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside flows to the closest domestic competitions of the mid-term elections
It is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing financial inflows due to the reorganization of congressional districts, which generated two holders of the office in a struggle for the same chair.
This recently led to the rebuilding of the Pittsburgh suburban district by the regional Democratic Republic of Conor Lamb – which received another district in the special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another holder of the office, the republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th.
After the highest court of Pennsylvania issued an opinion in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided for the benefit of the republicans, there was a routing of maps.
The race in the new 17th district launched a sharp financial split between the financial branches of the main party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the monitored March special elections to the 18th congressional district.
This chair has been occupied by the republican for over a decade, and Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Policy experts are giving the Democrats a slight head start.
America decides to fine Salvador for China's support, then resigns
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing under the mild pressure of Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until partners successfully relocated the organization team of Trump's leadership.
The representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to call upon the American Directors of the diplomatic mission from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan," said the spokesman for the Ministry of Health Nauert in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
However, the fines were considered only against Salvador, which received an estimated USD 140 million of US aid in 2017, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included the reduction of financial assistance and focused on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of murders.
With ongoing internal negotiations, the North American and Central American high-level conference representatives focused on security and economic prosperity following similar negotiations from the previous year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior executives explained that they wanted to continue the negotiations and effectively complete any penalties considered for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of a conference solution currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of a signal issued by the administration at the meeting by diplomats.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without having any new unbreakable news from Washington.
The White House Speaker, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by three American representatives, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the government's execution and also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Study History
Robert Mueller's report from the Special Commission on the possible defence of Mr Trump in law enforcement, which is now in public records, could be a definitive nail in the coffin.
Mr Mueller is also allegedly turning in his investigation to the fact that Mr Trump's campaign did not contain a secret agreement with Russia regarding the attack on our elections.
If there were to be an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr Trump would have to report to this body for responsibility, just as he is preparing to appear again in front of the voters, and eventually a jury composed of his colleagues would probably be waiting for him.
This is a series of "if" and I do not want to claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – as is the case with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice that will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to organize a coup against Hitler, only enough for the Western powers to stand up to him and support him in Munich Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments, which accelerate or slow down the relentless course of democracy.
The Americans are now facing a number of similar critical moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, this is the man who directs the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's had it in his head ever since the report announced that he had proposed secretly recording the president last year, and speculated that he was not in a state of health enough to stand up for the President's office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the versions of The Times are inaccurate.
“How do we react if the newly requested investigation of F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite convincing charges of sexual assault and perjury?
And most importantly, we're going to vote mid-term in Congress, which will render Mr. Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will wait for a long dark night.
But I believe we can't, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light candles on a swastika table about the Sabbath.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about meeting Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna knowing that the victory over Raksuken would give them a great deal of hope for the G Group of the European League after an impressive draw in Spain earlier this month.
The knee injury prevented the publisher, Graham Dorrans, from appearing on the playground for the first time in the season until the 2-2 Villarreal draw. However, they believe that Rangers can use the result as a reflective bridge to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a high-quality team," the 31-year-old said.
“We went into a fight with the belief that we could take something away, and we took the point away.
Maybe we could have multiplied it at the end, but overall, the draw was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second, we improved and we were better.
It'll be another big night in Europe on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's gonna be hard, because in the last game they've played a good score. However, with viewers behind me I'm sure we can push and it'll work out well.
Last year was hard enough, with all my injuries and changes at the club, but now it makes me feel so good.
The team's strong, and the boys are really enjoying it, and the training's fine too.
I hope we'll get on with it now, throw last season behind our heads, and we'll be successful."
Women worry about saving their pension
Although the participants had a clear idea of how to care for them, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of the people in the national study said that they were discussing long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to look after them, but they don't want to discuss it with him," explains Holly Snyder, vice president of the national life insurance company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care unless you reveal your wishes in advance.
Together with your counselor and family, discuss where and how to take care, because these factors can play a great role in determining the price.
Tell your financial advisor: A consultant can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Funding long-term care can, for example, be done through traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance, which will help you pay these expenses, or through your own insurance using your own resources – as long as you have the money.
Create your legal documents: Prevent legal battles as long as possible.
Choose a health care representative, which will be a reliable person who will supervise your medical care and ensure that your physicians respect your wishes if you are not able to communicate on your own.
Also consider writing out full power for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who will take financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are not eligible for it.
Do not forget the minor details: Imagine that your old parent urgently needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write these details into your written plan to be ready.

A man in Ilfracombe was shot several times by an air force
When a man walked home after a night move, he was hit by several shots from the air force.
About 40-year-old victim was found in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and arms.
The officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "a random act".
The victim didn't see it.
Wounding victims don't threaten lives, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died during a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pal on Friday, according to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase.
Since the communication is out of operation, the auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the regent of Donggal, which is a region north of Pal, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter by a force of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pal after the disaster broke out.
Here are some key facts about the city of Pal and the regent of Donggal, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, which is located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island and its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city had just celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, the administrative region under the province, had a population of 299 200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggal.
In the province, nickel mining is also important, but it is mainly concentrated in Moravali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi Island.
According to the Indonesian organization Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggal have hit tsunamis several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, tsunamis in Dongala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Tsunami struck the west of Donggala in 1996 when she claimed nine victims.
Indonesia is located on a seismic Pacific Fire Circle and there is a regular earthquake.
Here is a list of several major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the province of Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and at the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 - degree earthquake hit south of Indonesia’s most popular Java island and caused tsunamis that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The 7.6 degree earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: The 7.5 earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a ten - foot [10 m] tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and saved the lives of some 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake hit Pidie Jaya’s regency in Aceh Province and caused destruction and panic, as it reminded people of the devastating effects of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 died because of falling buildings.
2018: A strong earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where it killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily imprisoned.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaskan governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
According to a report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, a 29-year-old Palin living in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, violation of domestic violence and defence of arrest.
When a police report said his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin took her phone.
Palin was sent to Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is detained on an unsecured bond of $500, reports KTOU.
According to the network report, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself “definitely innocent” when asked for an opinion.
Palin faces three A-class offenders, which means he could be sentenced to a year of deprivation of liberty and a fine of up to $250,000.
At the same time, he was charged with a class B offence punishable by a one-day prison and a fine of $2000.
It's not the first time Palin has to face criminal charges.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
An alleged assault on the police was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently in front of the Alaskan war veterans' court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, violation of domestic violence reports and possession of weapons under the influence of stun substances in conjunction with the incident.
He allegedly punched his girlfriend in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of war veterans when her son’s violent behavior was associated with a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communication networks are off-line and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck directly at the intersection of Sulawesi Island, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
In social media there were videos showing the moment of the disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palo, when tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in NYC
The federal prosecutors in New York are demanding a death penalty for Sayfull Saip, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people died – an exceptional punishment that has not been granted for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly attacked a cycling route along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October with a rented truck called Home Depot, which was trashed by walkers and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, they will have to prove that Saip’s “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused a number of injuries, thus defining the conditions of the intention to grant the death penalty according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York Court.
According to the court documents, the two figures would mean the possibility of a death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury accused Saip of 22 crimes, including murder charges for extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and preparation”, the prosecutors claim, and describe the manner in which Saip's act was carried out as disgusting, cruel, and perverted.
“Sayfullo Habibullavic Saipov caused injuries, pain and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlijo, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci,” is mentioned in the intention.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York court last handed down the death penalty.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
Last time, the death penalty was actually carried out in connection with a federal case in New York City in 1953, when a married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed, proving conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs sat on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a relative from Uzbekistan, showed minimal regret in court documents during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he felt good about what he did.
According to Saip’s allegations, he was inspired by watching videos of the Islamic State on the phone.
The police also announced that they also demanded that the flag of the Islamic State be placed in the hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saip, said that they were “obviously disappointed ” by the decision of the plaintiffs.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt and a sentence of life without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone concerned," Patton said.
The team of Saip’s defenders had previously asked the plaintiffs not to demand the death penalty.
According to the members of the Conservative Party, he should be entrusted with negotiations on Brexit NIGEEL FARAGE
During today's protest, Nigel Farage committed to "mobilising the army of the people".
The former leader of the United Kingdom's Independence Party said that politicians must "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics – as suggested by one of Theresa May's own Members, should negotiate with the EU precisely by him.
Private conservative Peter Bone announced on his march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be out by now” if he was the secretary for Brexit Mr Farage.
But the problem that Mrs May faces in calming her ranks, where there is a deep rift, has been highlighted by conservatives fighting for EU retention, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan from Chequers in the course of attacks by the advocates of Brexit, the supporters of the EU and the EU itself.
The Allies insist on continuing their efforts to negotiate with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and 'chaos'.
Mr Bone said that the Leave Mens Leave group would gather in Solihull where he wanted to "get out of Chequers".
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would be out today," he said.
Ambassador Wellingborough added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to quit on Chequers.”
To show his opposition to the EU, he said, "We did not fight world wars to have to listen.
In our own country we want to make our own laws.”
Mr Bone rejected proposals that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British citizens would change their minds and wish to abstain is completely depraved."
The conservative advocate of Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who also took part in the march, told reporters: “I simply say, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him and they do not like our party members or our activists who currently fill the streets to be elected at all.
Forget Chequers and start listening.”
In a sharp report to Mrs May, she says, "Ministerial Presidents will keep their place when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage stated that conservative politicians must ‘get into an awkward situation’ if they wish to betray their decisions taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're standing here today to tell them that we won't let you."
In a report to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of defeating Brexit, to feel pressure.
"We are now mobilising the army of this country's people, who have provided us with a victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud United Kingdom that rules itself."
In the meantime, the Union advocates marched around Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists waved banners Conservatives against Brexit after the weekend start of the operation of this party.
Labour MP Lord Adonis made fun of conservatives because of the party's security problems after the conference.
"These are the people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technologies for Canada plus, for smooth borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"The whole thing's a fraction.
There is nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "think it over" the President's candidacy
American Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that after the November elections, she would "think her candidacy for the president" in a manner that would not be easy.
Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts has spoken about her future on Saturday at the West Massachusetts City Hall.
Warren, the frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is attempting to re-election in November against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She found herself at the center of speculation that she could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the town hall since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to apply for the office of president.
Warren replied that the time had come “for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which also means women in the highest place. ”
He was arrested by a suspect in the murder of Sims from LSU.
Baton Rouge Police, La., announced on Saturday that she detained a suspect from Friday's shooting a basketball player from LSU Wayd Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson, at 11:00 ET news conference.
A video was released from Friday's shooting with an application for identification of the man caught on tape.
Sims, 20, was shot on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that didn't match life," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through the 247sports website.
Wayde tried to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to moving at the scene, had a gun, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody in East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
6 feet and 6 inches high Sims, which grew in Baton Rouge, scored 32 matches, of which 10 were in the last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 points for the match.
Great Price of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of world champion when the team director played in his hand the victory over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valtteri Bottas finished his Saturday qualification before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the team director of the Mercedes would play a great role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the field and almost got rid of Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two corners and invited Vettel to attack a teammate.
Vettel went into the depot first, and he let Hamilton catch up with the cars circling the tails of the group, which should be decisive.
The rider of the Mercedes drove into the depa at a later time, and after leaving Vettela. However, Hamilton went forward, and in a close fight, the Ferrari rider was reluctant to leave the inner road free to defend himself after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen left the back row of the field and at the end of the first round he was in charge on his 21st birthday.
Then led after a large part of the race, because he held the original tyres as long as possible to focus on the quick finish and could take Kim Raikkon's fourth position.
Finally, he went to the depot at 44, but in the last eight rounds he could no longer raise his pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri's been doing a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he acted like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done a fantastic job and the reward is the first two places," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday's assembly for insisting that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech at the Western Virginia assembly, he did not directly mention Ford’s statement before the Senate Judicial Commission, and instead he declared that what was happening in the Senate was “evil and repugnant and lying. ”
“One thing that could happen, and a wonderful thing that has happened during the last days in Senar, when you see that anger when you see those people being angry and angry and repugnant and lying,” he said.
“When you look at publication and publication and they say to you, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you think you can get away?
Remember her answer... you published the document – ah, ah, ah, what?
Oh, no.
She didn't."
Well, wait a minute.
We published... no, that's not it," he added and imitated the senator.
The Feinsteins sent Ford a letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh in July and information escaped early in September – but Feinstein refused to leave her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s complaint, nor did I disclose any information about the case,” said Clomis Feinstein, as The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep everything a secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
However, her words seem to have been ignored by the president, who spoke on the occasion at the Saturday evening meeting: “I will tell you that this is a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but anyway, it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court judge, who was accused of sexual harassment by three women, and indicated that the Democrats used these charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take power back by any means available.
You see the vileness, the abomination, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to dump in the country to get back to power and steering," he quoted Mediaite as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer score twice for Giants versus Dundee
Dundee Stars fixed Friday's game in the Elite League against Belfast Giants winning Saturday's rematch in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
The Giants were soon engaged in two-stranded leadership thanks to the actions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillelier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to settle the house before Dwyer returned the Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard then again compared Dundee, after which two goals of Lukas Lundwald Nielsen guaranteed their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League in the season for Adam Keefe's team, who managed to defeat 2-1 in Belfast Dundee on Friday.
Both teams met on the fourth in the season, with all three previous matches dominated by Giants players.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, for Kendall's assistant McFaulla, while David Rutherford applied for an assistant at Beauvillelier's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got the homecoming back to the game at 1:10 p.m. and then Matt Marquardt scored for Cownie, who was comparing at 3:16 p.m.
Thanks to Dwyer, Giants went to the cabin for the first break, but only in the lead when he recorded his second goal of the evening at the end of the first third.
The household regrouped, and Bouchard again managed to settle the goal of the power game at 27:37 p.m.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together later in the second third of Nielsen for the first time in the match to rewind the lead on Dundee and the same player ensured the leadership of his team in the middle of the final third.
The Giants, who now lost the fourth of the last five games, will play another game Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic manager died to enable hundreds of people on board to escape an earthquake
The flight manager in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died as he watched to ensure that the plane managed to take off safely with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people were killed, and many are missing after the earthquake that caused the tsunami shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong subsequent shocks flooded the area and many people were trapped in the wreckage of Palu.
But despite the fact that colleagues of the 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung fled to save their lives, he refused to leave his place in a wildly repulsive control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palo.
He remained in his position to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, was able to take off safely.
Then he jumped from the steering tower down when he thought he was coming down.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, spokesmen's air traffic control, reported to Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We have prepared a helicopter transport from Balipan to Kalimantan, which was transferred to another city's hospital.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before he reached Pal.
"Our hearts are broken by this message," he added.
In the meantime, the responsible authorities expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for disaster management stated that access to the cities of Donggal, Sig and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths continues to rise, as many bodies remain unforgivable under the wreck and many of them still have not come to the rescue," said Sutopo Purwo Nugro.
Waves in the devastated Pal reached a height of up to six metres. Mass burials will take place in the city on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft bring assistance and supplies to affected locations.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies.
There's a shortage of drinking water.
Small stores have been stolen everywhere."
John Gelfand, head of the international red cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo came to Pal on Sunday and told the country’s military components: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks needed to evacuate.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok this year, killing more than 550 people.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that one person is missing after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline operating the flight, which crashed in a lagoon on one of the micron islands in the Pacific, has now stated that one person is missing, indicating at first that all passengers and crew of 47 safely evacuated from a diving aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press report that Saturday afternoon she was unable to find one traveling man.
The airline stated that it cooperates with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for a lost man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for details of this passenger, his age or his nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crews after the plane entered the water during an attempt to land at Chuuk airport.
Officials on Friday claimed that a total of seven persons had been transferred to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in care on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
However, what caused the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The U.S. Air Company and Navy reported that the plane landed in a lagoon before landing.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
American traveler Bill Jaynes said the plane landed from a very small altitude.
"That was very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes further stated that, along with others, he was able to get water along the belt deep into the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
He further stated that the on-board staff panicked and screamed and that he himself suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors who worked nearby on port pier repairs helped save the boat carrying passengers on shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network reports that during the last two decades, an aircraft with a PNG registration mark totalled 111 people died, but no accident was committed to Air Niuguni.
The analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution terminated its speech in this case, in which the man is repeatedly tried for burning a woman alive in the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice in the person of its analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours and provided expert reports in the field of intelligence analysis.
A jury analyst planned a scenario of how he used the cell phone records of 29 defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett stated that he had obtained localization data from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was dead on the night of her death in Chambers, which was contrary to his previous statement, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When his cell phone records showed that he was spending the night with Chambers, he found out that he was with his boyfriend, Michael Sanford, and then the police visited him.
Sanford stood before a court of law and testified that the day in question was not in the city.
When the prosecutors were asking if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that "he's lying because my car was in Nashville that night."
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
However, cell phone records indicate that the two only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis he erased Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased it entirely from his life," said Hale.
The defense will begin its closing remarks on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be brought before a jury later that day.
What is a conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to deal with negative views on this genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its beginnings with political messages and social problems.
So they want to go back to the roots and repopulate the conscious hip hop.
Artists, such as The Fugees and Commons, have already met with a revival in recent times thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the United Kingdom.
Another black girl?!
New York's tutor is suing a couple for her dismissal after a "racist" text message.
The New York educator is suing a couple for her discriminatory expulsion after receiving a mistransmitted text message from her mother, in which she was referred to as the “other black” text message.
A couple refused to be racists and compared the lawsuit with “the blackmail. ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her dismay when she discovered on her first day at work in 2016 that Giselle Maurice's new tutor, was black.
“NOTE, OTHER CERNOTE”, she wrote to her husband, Plasco-Flaxman, in the text report.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she was sent twice by P.M. Maurice.
When she understood her faux passport, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman’s “concerned” fired Mrs. Maurice and said that her outgoing educator, who was African-American, was working really badly and that she was expecting the Filipino instead, reported the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for compensation for his dismissal and is requesting an compensation of USD 350 for the day of his six-month engagement, for which she was hired at the beginning, even though without a contract.
“I want to show them that this is not done,” said Post this Friday, adding, “I know this is discrimination.”
The two, however, returned the strike with the fact that they were not racist, but that the termination of Mrs Maurice's employment was a suitable measure because they feared that they could no longer trust her after that insult.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racist," said her husband, Joel Plasco List Post.
“But would you put your child in the hands of someone whom you were rude to, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
Oh, come on."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to “deception, ” stating that his wife cared for only two months of an old child and was in“ a very difficult situation. ”
“Would you drive someone like this?
This is not a nice thing at all," the investment banker said.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the social media jury has condemned very quickly the two of them for their conduct and logic.
The publishers of the stories about Bear Paddington were afraid that readers would not identify with the talking bear, showing the latest reports
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said to the rapporteur: “It’s hard to feel in the situation of someone who reads it for the first time, even before publication.
It's very amusing to know now that we already know the great success of Bear Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired to write a children's book on a tiny ply bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, added on the 60th anniversary of a book publication that became a “sweethorn” dot after his death last year.
Paddington, described as “a very important member of her family, ” added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a quite quiet man, he was never a boastful man," she said.
“But since Paddington was such a real character to him, it was as if you had a child who had achieved something that you could truly be proud of.
I believe that Paddington's success was looking at this view.
Even though it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all the successes only to Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to call her goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louise Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that this is really bad and that she does not expect to get away with it," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"So I had a call from Nada telling me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say good-bye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medications her doctors gave her to keep her heart going, slowly losing her effectiveness, and leaving her body.
She died shortly after, and it was like everything closed down.
I just had to sit there and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it inside."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for her daughter's loss, joined the plane with other passengers without revealing what a difficult test she is going through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
“I kept my head shut, and my face was filled with tears all the time.
It's difficult to explain, but it was just during the flight that I felt an overwhelming understanding of Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
The grieving women send postcards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones as a result of suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending Welsh Bridge postcards with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can look for support.
Tyler's son, Mrs. Davis, was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and as a result, he took his life at the age of 18.
"I don't want any other parent to have to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said that her son was a gifted young chef with a contagious smile.
"Everybody knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile could light up every room."
Even before his death, however, he left work because he was “in a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found the unmovable body of his sibling after he had taken his life.
Davis says: “I’m constantly afraid of the effect it will have on his life. ”
Ms. Davis proposed postcards “to inform people that they have people at their disposal who are willing to help them and can talk to them even if they are friends.
Don't shut up - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is Mrs. Davies' flying girlfriend, lost Mark, who was 15 years of partner, shortly after his mother died.
"Nothing told me he felt at the bottom or depressed at all," he explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we observed a change in his behavior.
It was the worst day of Christmas – when children opened gifts, didn't even look at them, nothing."
She said that her partner’s death was a tremendous trauma to them, but that she had to gradually get through: “It can make a complete hole in the family.
It ripped us apart.
But we must all go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought we could get something that Mr Flake was actually asking for – an investigation at a time of limitation, with limited scope – we could bring a bit of unity into it," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would "disintegrate" because both parties would bury themselves in their positions in partisanity.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
Elections in the mid-electoral period are only five weeks away from us, on November 6th, and if the Republicans go wrong as expected, this will lead to their major weakening in attempts to enforce their requested man to the post at the highest court in this country.
George W. Bush telephoned the senators, lobbied with them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for President Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI compiles his report?
The Senate will vote on this and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh in the Senate can receive at least 50 votes, which enabled Vice President Mike Pence to break the draw and confirm with the Supreme Court.
The numbers of refugees from North Korea to Kim “declined”
The numbers of refugees from North Korea to South Korea since the beginning of the government of Kim Chong-un have fallen seven years ago, the South Korean legislators claim.
Byeong-seug Park, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, said that there had been 1127 refugees in the last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park further stated that the border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates required for smugglers at the borders were behind this.
Pyeongjang has not made any public statements.
Today, the vast majority of refugees from the North are receiving an offer for South Korean citizenship.
Soul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them run across China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China sees refugees as illegal migrants, not as refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
The relations between North and South – which are technically still in a state of war – have improved significantly in recent months.
This month the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on closed denuclearisation negotiations.
This was the occasion of the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Chong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive conditions for cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the US of not making any progress on the issue of sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way to be unilaterally disarmed," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and said he was unfit for service at the Supreme Court.
Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosiová called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and said that because of her temperament, she was inappropriate for serving at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment on Saturday's interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could not help but if any woman ever performed such a theatre, they would call it ‘hysteric’, Pelosi said in her reaction to Kavanaugh’s fourth statement before the Senate Judicial Commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all charges of sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both still teenagers.
During his opening word Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times he almost screamed and choked on talking about his family and his years at high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and said that their accusations against him were a “grote and coordinated attack” organised by liberals who could not move through Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he was unable to work with the Supreme Court because he showed that he was preconceived against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he relied on the Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi replied negatively to the question whether Kavanaugh would seek appeal if confirmed, even if the Democrats were to receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will tell you this – if he does not tell Congress the truth, then he is not only eligible for work at the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is working on now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosiová added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential returns in court under the Law on Acceptable Care or Roe vs. Wade because he was considered a conservative judge.
As part of his previous confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided answering the question of whether he would have reversed any decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There is no time for a hysteric, preconceived person to come to court and expect us to just say "Heah, that's beautiful," Pelosi said.
And women must rule.
After verbal outbursts, months, and years of anger, she could not get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we have anger," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continues: “A woman who was making a principal well of mine, who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a certain technique, which means that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: ‘ Perhaps you think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I have anger."
And so she went on.
And I think it's great."
Tears are acceptable as a means of reacting to anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in an office where men dominated, and I once expressed my inexplicable anger with tears, but an elderly, always cold manager, always a little worried, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me to the staircase.
"Never show them you cry," she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to have you."
Patricia Schroeder, a former democratic congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in an unmarried affair on board the Monkey Business ship and had to withdraw from the fight. Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It was not a well thought-out decision," she said with laughter after 30 years.
"The seven other candidates had already run, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snowman and Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had run for a long time at that time, it was unable to keep pace with the receipt of contributions, and so it committed itself not to play if it did not get $2 million in contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would only give her $250.
"Do you think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally carry out the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, by frustration with the system that made her struggling to raise money and focus on voters rather than on delegates and anger over sexism, that she was completely suffocating by anger.
"Perhaps you would think that I had been nervously shattered," Mrs Schroeder said about how the press reacted to it.
"And you might think that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they might write on my tombstone.
"Weeping"?
Why can the Chinese-American trade war be good for Beijing
The US-China trade war relief was deafening, and even though the battle is not far from being fought, experts say that there is a long-term benefit to Beijing between countries.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, gave the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
Most of the most significant escalations, however, saw the light of the world this week, when new USD 200 billion goods tariffs were announced (GBP (150 billion), which basically means taxation of half of China's exports to the US.
Beijing has always responded with the latest tariff drop of five to ten percent of the 60 billion American imports.
China was trying to repay the US with the same coin, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world would kneel.
Even if China wanted Washington to return to its original tracks, it would be to drop its demands, but public submission to US requirements would be totally humiliating for Chinese President Si Qin-pching.
Even so, experts believe that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long run, as it would reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
“The reality is that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic twist in both countries. It is much more dangerous than observers have allowed yet,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate who is focusing on Asia in the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, said foreign minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the conditions in the country are improving.
"Today's situation in the territory is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas of destroyed terrorists into normal conditions.
Now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are met, as well as unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The UN estimates that since the beginning of the 2011 war Syria has left more than 5.5 million people.
Another six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in building a devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe responds strongly to the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
The team Evria won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the US Team with a final score of 16,5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National field on the edge of the trouble in France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive European lands, and thus has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The star of the USA, Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tour, then blew the ball into the water on 3 pairs of 16 holes and let Francesco Molinari win.
Italian golfer Molinari then brightened up in all his rounds and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best result 5-0-0 since the existing tournament format was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spith was defeated by 5 and 4 players of the European team with the lowest rating, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest scorer Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who apparently graduated from his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of Eight Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia has become the overall best European player with 25.5 points won for his career.
"I don't normally cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, I'm really happy that I got the cup back.
Everything depends on the team, I am glad I could help," Garcia said after winning Europe.
He gave his countryman John Rampo a cup, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now recorded career record 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
The strange statistics of one of the best players of all time who has won 14 greatest titles, which can only be compared to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team saved the weekend in an effort to find fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed top golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team’s unsatisfactory results: “I am proud of these boys, they really fought.
This morning, we really warmed Europe up at heart.
We really didn't make it.
I'm sucking my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup, and in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee, we will move forward.
I like those 12 guys. I'm glad I could make them captain.
I really need to lose weight.
You've played us."
Red tide update: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota districts
The latest report by Florida Fish and Wildlife points to a general decline in red tide concentrations in Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, blooming waters stains are now reported from the regions of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – this indicates a decreasing concentration.
The flowering water of the red tide is about 130 miles coastline from the northern district of Pinellas to the southern district of Lee.
The stains were observed about 10 miles from the coast of Hillsborough, but last week it was relatively smaller.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco.
In the Hillsborough area, low to high concentrations, lowest to high concentrations in the Manatee district, lowest to high concentrations in the coastline or in the Sarasota region, the lowest to medium concentration in the Charlotte region, the lowest to high concentration in the coastline or on the free sea at the Lee district and the low concentration in the Collier district were reported.
Respiratory irritations continue to occur in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Respiratory irritation was not reported in northwest Florida last week.
