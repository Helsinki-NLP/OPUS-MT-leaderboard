No. of newly arrived recruits from Ukraine to Donbass
The official of the People ' s militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People ' s Republic (LNR) Andrey Morocco said that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine would send at least 3,000 recruits to Donbass.
According to him, Kiev is therefore planning to “make up the units somehow”.
“The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has led to a low number of units”, said Morocco, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians to the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched a so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by a joint force operation (JO).
This measure was expected to increase the role of Ukrainian forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbassa was exacerbated by the killing of the head of the DNR, Alexander Zaharchenko.
The authorities of the DNR qualified what happened as a terrorist.
Several persons involved in the explosion were detained during the criminal investigation.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the diversion was organized by Ukrainian special forces.
U.S. authorities have forced Mask to leave the position of Chairman of the Tesla government
American businessman Ilon Musk will leave the post of Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla, which he founded, at the request of the U.S. authorities.
In order to settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the enterprise will also pay $20 million to the company.
According to the CNBC, pre-trial agreement with the department allows Maska to remain in charge of Tesla.
However, he is required to pay $20 million and to leave the post of Chairman of the Board of Directors within 45 days of the date of the agreement and at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed.
It is clarified that the agreement should still be approved by the court.
On 28 September, it became known that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Mask of misleading shareholders of having sufficient funds to buy out the company ' s shares and had submitted to the entrepreneur before the court.
This is a publication by a Twitter businessman, where he said he wanted to buy Tesla shares for $420 apiece, but he never did.
After a tweet, companies grew by almost 11%.
The head of the British MIDA compared the EU with the Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of seizing the member countries of the community.
This statement was made by a diplomat at the convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, 30 September.
As Daily Mail points out, Hunt has thus commented on difficulties in the negotiation process on Brexit.
What happened to belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union has not allowed anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is evident: if you turn the EU from community to prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity," the Minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for deciding to leave the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, notes Gazeta.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Teresa May said that the talks on Brexit had stalled.
So she commented on the outcome of the Euro Union informal summit in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was adopted in 2016 following a referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact once London leaves the community.
In addition, the Irish border issue remains open.
Two dogs were given to the Democratic People's Democratic Republic of Korea by the President of South Korea.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in received a gift from North Korean leader Kim Chen Yin two puppies after his visit to Pyongyang.
Reuters referred to the representative of the administration of the South Korean President.
"At the summit, a pair of phunnsan dogs were offered as a gift.
They were received on Thursday," the department reported.
For dogs about a year, the North Korean side handed over several kilograms of feed as aid for their adaptation.
A gift was given to honour the Inter-Korean Summit, which took place from 18 to 20 September in Pyongyang.
The hunting breed of the phounsan of the North Korean wolves was named after one of the DPRK districts.
According to the agency, Moon loves animals, and he's already got two dogs that were given to him by North Korea's last North Korean leader, Kim Chen Ir.
Dogs aren't the only gift.
Kim Chen-Yun also handed two tons of delicate fungi to his colleague.
It ordered the distribution of these mushrooms to members of separated families during the Korean War who had not yet reunited with their relatives from the DPRK.
The head of the Altay Selsowiet has stopped starving to protect the interests of the inhabitants
The MP reported on his Facebook page that he had stopped starving for several reasons.
The head of the Selsovet stated that the situation had stalled, that the district administration had not responded to its demands, but needed to do its work.
In addition, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office initiated a review of the situation, and the heating organization of the STPC promised to begin work on the preparation of the winter heating system for the Siberian settlement next week.
The residents of the Selsovet have also drafted and imported a mass collective treatment to the Governor of Altay region, “restricting the current catastrophic situation”.
Boronin himself reported that he felt normal; he was fully performing his duties as a head during the famine.
As Boronin explained, the Siberian and Rogulic villages have centralized heat supply systems, and therefore the Administration of the Pervomayi will have the authority to prepare them for the winter.
However, no one has yet begun this work.
The head of the Selsovet also protested the lack of adequate control and support by the Government of the Altay Region and against the financial policy of Gazprommmmmmösgeongaz Novosibirsk.
In addition to the proper preparation of the villages for the winter, Boronin demanded “to organize immediately in the municipality a full-fledged and self-sustained area of utilities with the relevant units”.
Newly named Moscow with cheapest apartments
In the first half of 2018, some 3,000 housing units of 30 square metres were purchased in Moscow’s new buildings and costing up to four million roubles.
More than half of these transactions were made by two JCs, as evidenced by the Urbanus portal (with Lenta.ru).
The budget sales leaders of up to four million roubles were HC Nekrasovka, located outside the ICAD, the Kotelniki district (SWAO), and the Barbaris apartment complex in the Bibirevo area (SWAO).
Two HKs in New Moscow, South Bunino and Clenove Alleys, were also visible in the structure of budget housing transactions.
Urbanus analysts note that the share of housing transactions to four million rubles in these new buildings reaches 60 per cent of all sales and provides half of the total proceeds.
“One should recognize the impact of apartments with a budget of less than four million roubles on the commercial success of the Central Micro Area in New Vatutinky and Filat Lug,” says the study of two more New Moscow JCs.
They generate about 35 per cent of financial income.
Formerly, in Moscow, with the cheapest apartments in new buildings, they presented the real estate agency Bon Ton.
According to the company, the lowest prices for primary housing (149.9 thousand roubles per metre) were recorded at UWAO in September 2018.
In the second and third places, the VAO and the SWAO were estimated at 184.1 and 192.8 thousand roubles respectively.

Telegram users complained about a malfunction in the new version
iPhone users complained about problems with the Telegram Messenger after the update of 28 September.
The user's phone number can be found out from its version
Complaints relate to boyfriends with an up-to-date iOS 12 operating system.
According to their owners, when updated, the application shows a white screen or closes immediately.
The Messenger's representatives responded to the crash.
They said that the problem could be the migration of information to a new application written in Swift.
Telegram temporarily suspended the automatic update of the app until the troubles were resolved.
On 13 April, the Tagan Court of Moscow granted Roscomnadzor's claim to block the Messenger Telegram in Russia.
Three days later, communications operators began to implement the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the Messenger Administration to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence needed to obtain data on terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and phone number of the terrorist suspect when a court decision was reached.
Telegram Auditorium After Blocking in the RF Reduced by 1.2 million

Finally, the red lights are on behind the gates.
We knew Minsk would be loaded for the game, we'd try, that's how it worked.

But we played the defense very well, we didn't give the rival much chance, we didn't catch us on shifts, and Dynamo didn't have a lot of leverage, so it ended well for us, and Hartley's saying the oms club press service.

He was joking. He promised not to take the road from the champagne shower.
Vice President Lewis Hamilton, winner of the 16th stage of the Formula One Grand Pri Russia Championship, was jokingly promising not to hold the champagne shower for Russian President Vladimir Putin, as in 2015.
"This time I will not hunt you champagne, and this time it was someone else," said Hamilton during a brief conversation with the Head of State, transmitting TASS.
Putin laughed in reply and grabbed the racer on his shoulder.
“It’s all right,” said the Russian leader, commenting on the situation three years ago.
The Grand Prix of Russia, "Formula-1", was held at Soci Autodrome from 28 to 30 September.
The second place was the Finnish pilot "Mersedesa" Walter Bottas.
The third was the German Ferrari racer Sebastian Fettel.
The Russian leader congratulated Hamilton on his victory and presented him with a reward.
In the "Formula-1" tradition, after awarding the prize, the racers open champagne.
On 11 October 2015, Putin also attended a solemn ceremony.
Hamilton, who, like this year, owned the cup, opened the bottle and poured champagne on all those present, including the President of Russia.

Ilon Musk is forced to resign as Head of the Board of Directors of Tesla
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission and founder Tesla Ilon Musk settled their fraud dispute.
CNBC News reports on this.
According to the TV channel, Masku will have to leave the position of head of the Board of Directors of Tesla within the framework of the agreements reached.
In doing so, the commission allowed Maska to retain the position of Head of Tesla.
The founder of Tesla is also said to have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount will come from Tesla.
In doing so, the money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company should appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Mask is an American entrepreneur who is listed as the world’s 50 richest people in the Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the SpaceX space corporation, the neurotech company Neuralink, and the founder of Tesla's electricians, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had previously tried Tesla Ilona Mask's CEO because of his Twitter report on the possible redemption of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy out all stock on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The value of the $420 share was allegedly set “because of the importance of this figure in marijuana culture”, the Bloomberg agency previously reported, referring to the director of the security department of the commission Steven Pekin.
However, Elon Musk subsequently refused his plans to buy out the shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman stated that the allegations of fraud were unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
"Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I did not break it in any way," said a businessman in a CNBC interview.
In August, however, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective action against Mask, complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessmen had lost their jobs.
In particular, one shareholder stated that the tweets of the businessman had been misleading, causing Tesla shareholders to be forced to purchase paper at artificially overpriced prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that the careless remarks of Ilon Mask had led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Ilona Mask accused the stock exchange frauds of being also the head of the research company Citro Research.
In the meantime, if Mask had not been able to settle his dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he would have been in danger of being removed from the management of the company and even the prison.
In particular, CNBC has stated this to the former chairman of the Harvey Pitt Commission.
Mask is "a good guy who can't run a car company."

In the RCC, the possible name of the OPC was compared to the fascist actions
The head of the Division of External Church Relations (OCC) of the Moscow Patriarchate Metropolitan, Volkolamsky Ilarion, compared the possible name of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists in Germany.
Metropolitan Volocolamsky Ilarion - on the causes of the conflict with the Constantinople Patriarchate, the possible ecclesiastical rift and its political subtext
He said that now that “the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in an acute stage”, the name of the church is the same as in Fascist Germany, “the Jews put on a yellow six-point star”.
“This means marking the church as an enemy organization, and that is why the bill was created,” said the representative of RPC on TV channel “Russia 24.
Mitrovica also stressed that OPC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian church, because “the religious people of the church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patriots of their country”.
UPC called on the Constantinople Exarches to leave its territory
Grand Prix in Sochi: Anglag, Russian pain and the return of Kuwait
During the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing pain.
Deputy Prime Minister of the RF Dmitri Kozak said this, citing meetings with Russian auto-producers prior to the start of the Grand Pri Russia in Sochi.
The Deputy Prime Minister also shared the view of the return of Daniel Kwit to Toro Rosso and assessed the attendance of the Russian phase “Formula-1”.
As a result of our meeting with the car manufacturers, it is in the foreseeable future that the establishment of the Russian Formula One Bold, which has no analogues in the world, was the result,” said Dmitry Kozak.
We must promote our auto-producers in this direction.
It was about plans until 2024, but I don't think it's possible in such a time frame.
I think it's a more real term for the next ten years."
From 2012 to 2014, Marusia was a Russian-licensed member of the "Formula-1".
According to the Vice Prime Minister, there are already investors ready to invest in the establishment of a national team in the world championship race in Formula-1.
I know that there are road sports fans in Russia, wealthy businessmen who are willing to invest are ready to invest in the formation of the "Formula-1" Russian team, he said.
"We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we have a team like this.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team has also emerged because Sochi had such infrastructure."
Sochi Autodrom is waiting for an angel tomorrow.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers were able to carry out all 50,000 tickets.
Look, even the tribunes have been practically filled, said the Vice Prime Minister.
I can say that this year's benefit has increased by 72 per cent compared to last year.
That's a good, positive outcome.
We are also preparing a plan of action to improve the use of Soci Autodrom infrastructure throughout the year.
This will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dmitri Kozak did not attend, and the main theme of the day for Russian car lovers was the return of Daniel Kwata to Toro Rosso.
We are all congratulating Daniel and wishing him success next season, said Vice Prime Minister "Investigation".
He is the Giver of hope.
Next year, for the first time in history, two main Russian pilots will participate in the "Formula-1" pilot.
Although the future fate of Sergey Sirotkin in the Royal Races remains unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not yet impressive: he took 18th place in the qualification of Gran Pri Russia.
Hopefully, next season our main pilots will be more than this year,” said Dmitri Kozak.

His words are from Rostogazeta.ru.

On September 30, 1928, exactly 90 years ago, British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of an era of modern antibiotics, brought world fame to Fleming and made it a Nobel laureate.
By the way, separating penicillin from mold mushrooms was not the first opening of Fleming.
A few years earlier, he, being cold, planted a slime from his own nose on a Petri dish (such as a glass lid in which he had experience with bacteria) and in a few days discovered that the bacteria there had been destroyed.
In fact, penicillin was also discovered by accident.
Fleming's name has been listed as 100 of the most outstanding personalities in the history of mankind.
Its discovery, in the opinion of many scientists, has changed history.
Penicillin was used to treat most of the ancient diseases, previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, the Paris newspaper wrote, "For the defeat of Fascism and the liberation of France, he did more than a dozen divisions."
Experts estimate that opening Fleming to the world's first antibiotics saved the lives of more than 200 million people on Earth.
Alexander Fleming died in his London home in 1955 from a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous Council of London of St. Paul.

Trump spoke of "love" in Kim Chen Yin
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have hardly reached the point of falling in love with each other, which Donald Trump joked.
United States President Donald Trump noted a good joke about his success at the front of the North Korean crisis.
With mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now made such a difference that they are almost in love with each other, the President of the United States noted.
The White House owner recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as a major challenge in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had been so involved with the DPRK that it could not even reach the country's leadership, they simply did not take the call.
At that time, the United States and the DPRK were on the brink of war, and today the North Korean leader writes in the White House “wonderful letters”, Trump noted.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work he was also cruel to Kim Chen Yin, which was, by the way, mutual.
But now their relationship has turned out to be so much that the leaders have fallen in love with each other.
In doing so, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to the fact that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests and has been closing military ranges.
All of this is due to the work of his administration, confident of the American President.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump responded lightly to Kim Chen Yin of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and the steps taken to deescalate tensions.
In doing so, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK would continue until the total denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

At the same time, other practical steps on the path of North Korea ' s denuclearization are still on the move.
The media reported that after the Singapore Summit, the DPRK had already sent several disarmament scenarios, but Pyongyang rejected them by calling them “gangster”.

No one called for the removal of “Moscow language by Ukrainian product”
Ukrainian children's writer and native language champion Larisa Nitza called for the suppression of “Russian-speaking Moscow product and language” from Ukraine.
To do so, it proposes a Ukrainian product called “cultural wave, cultural pressure”.
Nia shared her views on “the usefulness of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine” with the Ukrainian edition “Observer”.
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it has already been eaten and continues to develop further.
In time, Ukrainians “get better” from this“ Moscow language”, she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said that Russian speech had been widely used on television and radio, but in public space it remained virtually unchanged.
In Nice's view, however, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of Russian are, in her view, merely “extreme the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
In the past, Nia shared her experience in maintaining the Ukrainian language regime in the Carpathian children's camp, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court with a network of Watsons bookstores, one of which she was interviewed in Russian.
Without her success, Nia ran into the girl of surrender.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is referred to as “language schizophrenia”, calling on Ukrainians to give up Russian letters even in writing their names.
Nizai recently stated that the name Russian had been stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service could not escape the wrath of the writer: when she came there and heard the staff talking to each other in Russian, she did a scandal and left by knocking down the door.

How did he feel today?"
"If you last 90 minutes, it's okay!
In fact, he felt good.
Maybe at the end of a little shore of power so nothing happens.
And so, doctor and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolevich Gashnev led me to this game, for which I thank them very much!
"What about the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after winning and recovering, it's easier, and the mood in the group is good.
Now we've got a white one, though it was black at first.
We must continue in the same spirit and be glad of the sick.”
"Did he miss the game at the time that he didn't go out?"
"There is this, a little bit missed, because indeed, an unpleasant situation has come to pass.
But again, thanks to the physiotherapist and the doctors for getting on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and gave it to the sick.
The rest is secondary."

Citizens are invited to answer one question during Sunday's referendum: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by adopting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
The referendum is intended to resolve the 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece regarding the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.

The head of the Council of the Federation for International Affairs, Constantine Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly to be a success for Russia and does not rule out the possibility that it could become a turning point in the perception of the RF as an integral participant in addressing global problems.
“The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric we have almost become accustomed to in recent years with respect to Russia has now been more muffled”, the senator said in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that, in previous years, the RF at times “has been identified as one of the three major threats to humanity, in addition to Ebola’s fever, in addition to climate change or terrorism, Russia has been in this row, in any event, in a statement by a group of Western countries that has been expressed in a unanimous manner.”
At the 73rd session, stressed Kosachev, “the Russian theme was practically absent”.
“If I carefully analyze the statement by the President of France, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I am not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, people were not exactly correct”, noted the politician, noting that Russia “was no longer a wall that was trained by the tennis ball”.
The head of the Saufed Professional Committee does not rule out that this indicates a trend that he believes “will be to allocate the present session [the UN General Assembly], although this trend may occur in a year, in two, three”.
“I do not rule out that the current session in a sense may be reversed”, Kosachev said, explaining that “a number of examples of how Russia’s involvement in international affairs manages to move forward”.
As an example, he cited situations in Syria, Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be needed over time," the parliamentarian added.
This is because he believes that there is “an adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not only possible - an integral participant in addressing global problems of modern times”.
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we're going through a point where the movement will no longer be reversed, it will be moving forward," he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context, Kosachev called “a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
“I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the Geneva session] of the Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was delighted to see that if a year or two or five years ago to Russian opinion, the Russian vision of the world was largely uninterested, the situation was not the case now,” said the chairman of the Sofed Committee.
In his view, this is due to the fact that “the so-called new liberal order, which faces the West, does not have answers to questions about how to address world problems due to the apparent lack of ideas in global space, the lack of ideas on how to address the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problem of migration”.
“And here the request for a Russian vision becomes more and more obvious”, Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that in this sense he considered “the current session to be a good session for the Russian delegation to be a good one for Russia”.

Although the Dutchman is upset.
And we congratulate Hamilton.
His break from Fettel increased by 50 points.
Bottas looks at the side with resentment, I guess.
In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that in the Syrian province, Idlib will not have to use military force, said the head of the Ministry of Interior of the Syrian Arab Republic Valid Muallem.
Syria, he said, had the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly address the withdrawal of fighters banned in Russia by Jebhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports the RIA Novosti.
The head of the MIDA also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to military solutions to the problems of the territories east of the Euphrates in case Kurds sought secession.
At the same time, Muallem felt that the talks with the Kurdish forces of the SDF had been good until the United States had stopped.
On 17 September, Putin and the President of Turkey, Recep Erdogan, agreed to establish a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry led the Chelsea youth team.
It was previously reported that a 37-year-old defender negotiated the transition to Moscow's Spartacus.
According to RT, with a reference to Mirror, the former captain of England's assembly, John Terry, led the Chelsea youth team.
According to the source, a well-known player who has long served as a member of the London Club will lead the team at least 23 years of age.
It's noted that Terry's training headquarters will replace Jody Morris who went to Derby County.
Remember, in September Terry was close to moving to Moscow's Spartacus, but eventually gave up the idea after talking to his family.
The first Vice Speaker of the Supreme Council, Irina Gerashchenko, apologized to the person convicted in the F for “spying” by Ukrainian journalist Roman Suschenko for not being able to release him.
She spoke about this in a video feed to a political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Suschenko FSB.
She said that during these days, the Russian Embassy in Paris is under the walls of action, with participants declaring a hunger protest demanding the release of the Kremlin's prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, there are and well-known people who are starving, supporting Oleg Stsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interviews where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us had to put pressure on the Kremlin, put pressure on Putin with one requirement - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea," Gerashchenko said.
She also expressed confidence that the tests would cripple every Ukrainian by making us “worse, stronger in protecting Ukraine’s national interests, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil”.
Remember, Ukrainian correspondent Roman Sushchenko was detained by Russian forces on 30 September 2016 at Moscow airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with espionage to the Ministry of Foreign Intelligence.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushenko to 12 years of strict regime, and the Supreme Court of Russia found the verdict legal.
Russian prisoners granted the Ukrainian last request prior to its stagement to the colony.
NASA reported nearing the Earth of an asteroid the size of Big Ben
NASA's American Space Agency reported that the Earth is approaching a large SP1 asteroid that can reach 160 metres long.
According to Daily Express, the space object may exceed the size of the famous Big Ben or the London wheel of observation.
However, there is no accurate data on its size yet.
The speed at which SP1 is moving is about 60,000 km/h. The smallest distance between asteroid and Earth will be 3 October.
Then it will fly past our planet at the distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million km.
The asteroid was first observed on 19 September.
NASA has included him with near-earth objects.
Earlier, on 27 September, the Japanese Aerospace Research Agency published the first video from the surface of Asteroid Rugu.
Two Japanese rovers (planetaries) launched from Hayabusa-2 probe succeeded in obtaining unique footage.
The BM-2018 football stadium was awarded to Baste
The damage to the stadium in Rostov-na-Don was linked to a concert by Russian rapper Vasilia Vakulenko, or Basta.
Photo published in Instagram-accurate hd7tv.
"We're very good at Baste and his work, but unfortunately for the lawn," says the caption to the photographs.
The comments alleged that grass was damaged at the edge of the field because of protective cover (special tile).
The concert, scheduled for 29 September, was never cancelled.
The Rostov Football Club, as well as the Russian Premier League, opposed the concert.
“I want to know the names of those football players and the representatives of Rostov who claim that my speech can cause harm, hinder the activities and development of the football club, and affect the performance of its players,” Basta wrote in response to criticism.
"Rostov Arena" is one of the stadiums of the World Cup 2018.

"I couldn't even hold a spoon."
Kikabize Wakhtang Cancer Control
Many artists are now talking about how they managed to deal with oncology.
Unfortunately, the disease does not spare anyone, but the history of popular people of cancer victories gives hope to many who are sick.
A famous actor, Wakhtang Kikabidze, admitted to living only because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible condition that sounded like a sentence.
"I was struck with a hammer down the skull.
I fell.
He's lost his mind.
They put him in the hospital.
There the spoon could not hold, could not stand, fell all the time.
We started doing tests, and it turns out bad things, and the artery doesn't leak blood.
They brought me to Moscow, they said that I had a big dung brush in my head, and they had an emergency surgery.
During the operation, doctors for the brush saw a tumor," Kikabidze told the program “Once upon a Time. ”
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the residents of Tbilisi even came to say good - bye to the best man on his doorstep.
But the actor's wife did not allow a living actor to be buried, and she believed that she could cope with the disease, and for more than a year she had not left her beloved husband's bed.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Every time I had critical situations, she was close as a rock," the actor admitted.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, and now he lives happily in his home in central Tbilisi.
And every once in a while he denies the story of his sickness, and of the timeless doom that the matter is brought forth in the Web.
The creators of the site "Peacemaker" introduced the section "Physicalist" of the Foreign Minister of Hungary Peter Sijarto.
The occasion was “the attempt on Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity”.
In addition, the head of the MB countries found “direct threats to the invasion of Ukraine” and “support of separatist sentiments in Ukraine” as well as “participation in the organization of provocation aimed at mass violations by Ukrainian citizens of Ukrainian legislation”.
Note that before Siarto, Deputy Kyevo-Pecherska Lavra, Paul and the chairman of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriates) of Onufry, agreed to the Purgatory.
Their opposition to the acquisition of Tomos by the Ukrainian Local Church was a factor.
Earlier, in commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine in Zakarpatje, the President of Ukraine, Petar Poroshenko, demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
Authorities named the amount of the gold parachute of the crow's governor
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of Voronez Region, Yuri Aguibalov, was made under the regional law on State posts.
At the same time, the real amount of “gold parachute” released from office by the clerk was slightly lower than the amount reported in the media.
Such explanations were provided by the press service of the regional government.
Under the law, the salary for the Aguibalova post is 11,189.
Thus, it was stressed in the press service that the one-time payment was less than the income tax of 223,892 rubles, not the 1 million rubles reported by the media.
The official received an old-age insurance pension from July 2018.
He has been in public office for more than nine years.
The assignment of the pension and the one-time payment were made to him as soon as he was dismissed, explained to the agency “RIA Novosti” in the Government area.
However, the payment of Aguibal ' s pension allowance has been suspended on appointment to the State and its salary has not changed as compared to the previous period.
The Governor-General of the region, Alexander Gusev, who won the election, took office on 15 September.
Aguibalova was released from office in connection with the expiration of the term of office of head of the area.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public office in the region had been completed.
On 29 September, the Nezigari Telegram Channel published documents which indicated that Aguibalov, who had resigned from the post of Vice Governor, had paid an indemnity allowance of 23 salaries, and two days after that he again received a similar post without a “fario”.
Member of the State to tell schoolchildren about the harm of masturbation
Onishchenko is the first Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on his experience in his work, he noted in an interview that adolescents are provoked to masturbate by the harmful information they find on the Internet.
It was at the level of educational institutions and the family, and a deputy added to the fight.
Gennady Onishchenko, MP of the RF State (interviewed by Radio Speak Moscow):
As part of the overall sexual education of children, it is necessary to do so by explaining the damage, for there is a risk to the child’s sexual health, both for the boy and for the girl.
The problem is objective, it is that child mating is early enough, and there are still large scissors between their sexual mating and the possibility of formal inter-sex contacts.
According to Onishenko, the problem is hampered by “marriage”, the silence of “sexual age” and the lack of a culture of adequate education for children.
The doctor is confident that many adolescents face up to masturbation.
The MP believes that the practice of the lessons on the harm of masturbation is primarily in the schools of “hyperurbanized” regions.
"If we begin this conversation in our Muslim Republic, we will not be understood with you, gently speaking," said the professor.
Gennady Onishchenko is an active academic of Ramn, a member of the Ramn Bureau, doctor of medical sciences, Professor.
Deserved doctor of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, a member of the Bureau of the Pan-Russian Public Organization of the League of National Health.
The families of those who died in Izmailovski will be helped by "Heat"

The family was told about this in the company immediately after the tragedy.

As a result of the tragedy, several vehicles collapsed under the tarmac, and two young people died at the scene from burns.
Adg became the second most popular in Germany
The Antiimmigrant Alternative for Germany is another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
It appears that the people of Germany have taken seriously Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which has led the country to become the target of millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The latest polls suggest that the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany is becoming more popular and that the positions of the ruling bloc, Merkel and Zeehofer, are weakening.
This week, Adg broke the next record by raising the second line in the rating of popular sympathy.
The right conservatives, with 17 percent popularity, managed to bypass social Democrats, with about 16 percent.
The gap in one percentage point can be written down on statistical error, but it cannot be overlooked that a small group of Eurosceptic economists created in 2013 has been able to become a serious political force.
Leadership in general readings continues to retain the ruling HSS/HTS block, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a trend towards loss of points, with Angela Merkel's support of four percentage points above in April.
The German Chancellor ' s personal rating, headed by the German Government, is also decreasing.
Today, 48 per cent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 per cent lower than last year.
Add that “green” (15 per cent), left (11%) and liberals (10 per cent) were followed by social democrats.
The evolution of "Alternatives"
The "Alternative for Germany" party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the "Alternative Choice 2013" group, which was made up of members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The Group initially stood in opposition to the government course, but only economic issues, including Euro issues and EU interactions, were dealt with at the outset.
In doing so, the group opposed the “sponsoring” of the EU 's weak economies by Germany, not excluding the possibility of a return to the German brand and the full withdrawal of the country from the European Union.
Against the background of the deepening immigration crisis, the ADG political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that captured the European skeptics' niche and began severely criticizing the Government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, Adg was able to break through the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 parliamentary seats (from 709).
Two representatives of "Alternatives for Germany" received seats in the European Parliament.
A video was published with a journalist who called the citizens of Ukraine "the nation of the Bolvans"
The leading political talk show on Ukrainian TV, the author of the two books Ostap Drozdov on direct air, admitted what he considered his fellow countrymen to be the “nation of the baboons”.
They believe the TV and they don't read much.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
“We have not been taught the culture of reading and acceptance of texts since childhood,” said the journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov for his lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio Independent has begun to fight against literature that has the slightest hint of criticism by the Kiev authorities, banning imports of as many as 201 editions.
Manchester City played Brighton and joined the APL leaders.

Canadians have created a car in case of an apocalypse - a magazine behind the wheel
Anyone who wants to buy this car can buy it.
Roshel Defence Solutions stated that she was already accepting applications for her new armour.
Broneuvik Apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
It is not just video games, cinemas, and book publishing that make money on the topic of the apocalypse.
The new niche is now being developed by car companies.
So, Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented her armored apocalypse to Senator APC.
In a time free of fantasy, the engineers of this company are creating armored cars for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who are not comfortable, but are fully securely placed in a full-blown armourcapsule.
This bunker, otherwise you won't call it a construction, because its level of armor is in line with standard B7, installed on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup.
Its bottom, also armored, can protect the capsule from damage by grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Bronze Salon Apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
In order for passengers not to be harmed by an explosive wave from the wrecked vehicle, the car salon is equipped with special depreciating chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire extinguishing system.
For a safe inspection, the Roshel Senator APC vehicle is equipped with a round-view camera with night vision functions and a view-based armored tower on the roof.
There's no weapons in the car.
Front of the Armor Salon Apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
In order for the weight of the armored car not to affect its mobility, Roshel Senator APC has a 330-strong 6.7 litre turbo-diesel engine, which has the full power of four rounds of armour through a 6-step automatic gearbox.
There's no chance of getting stuck with the armory of the Roshel Senator APC.
The armory of the Roshel Senator APC apocalypse will be available at a specialized exhibition in Washington, D.C., which will take place in October.
The term of death of the universe is called
The universe is still about 140 billion years old, ten times the age of the world under review, about 13.8 billion years old.
The study of the international scientific community has been published in the library of electronic components of arXiv.org and has been published in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Such findings have been made by experts watching the Subaru telescope's HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) for approximately ten million galaxies.
Having studied the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounted for more than 95 per cent of the world's energy mass, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model
The Subaru Observatory's press release noted that the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and that the data of the European Space Telescope Planck clarified the limits imposed on
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments in favour of the world being watched ending its existence 22 billion years later as a result of the Great Gap.
Another attempt to unify the initiators of the pension referendum failed
The ability to know the people's opinion on pension reform is delayed indefinitely
On Saturday, a general-federal group of referendums against rising retirement age met in Moscow.
Representatives of 13 sub-groups registered different language issues (all the Centres registered five).
They decided to apply to the CEC for registration of a single initiative group and to ask the Russians: “Do you want the retirement pension legislation as of 1 July 2018, the age on which Russian citizens are entitled to an old-age pension?”
The wording was registered by the Vologoda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the assembly, but it was considered to be the simplest and legal embankment.
Most of the participants in the meeting were supporters of Justice Russia member Ili Sviridov (six sub-groups) and CRCF (four sub-groups).
Three independent sub-groups, from Lower Novgorod, Voronez and Orenburg, joined them.
Sviridov used to say that the invitations had been sent to all the initiators and that representatives of some 40 subgroups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenov, head of the Volhod subgroup (she was supported by 15 more subgroups), said, “The news”, that the invitation was not received and was not planned: “We did not understand who is the friend, but who is the enemy.”
A blue singer named Otis Rush died

Zenetula Bilaledinov: Admiral has caused us great problems
Zenetula Biljaletdinov's head coach led the match of the KHL regular champion against Admiral (4:2).
"The hard game was.
The rival fought with dignity, causing us great problems.
I'm glad we played nice today in most of them.
I've already told you that once the goals will come, the main thing is that we work on it.
And that we have won a very important one too."

"We have our own program on which he works.
That's why it was such a decision," draws the words of Bilaledin's press service club.
Ilon Musk will leave the position of head of the Board of Directors of Tesla
Under the agreement, Mr. Musk would have to resign as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla and pay a fine of $20 million to the President of the Board of Directors of Tesla.
In doing so, the businessman will retain the position of CEO of the company and report to AFP with reference to the regulator's data.
Tesla will also have to pay a fine of $20 million.
Earlier, the regulator had filed a claim against Ilon Mask - officials thought he had misled Tesla investors because the businessman had allowed the purchase of all the shares of a high-cost company - $420 per paper.
In the battle of "Loko" - "Ahmat" the error of Turbin fell from the horns of abundance.
Vladimir Levitin, a former federal judge, commented on the work of an arbitrator, Evgeny Turbin, in the match of Russia's 9th round of Lokomotiv, Ahmat, and considered the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you estimate the judiciary of Evgenia Turbina in the Lokomotiv match - Ahmat?
- I believe that the arbitrator has confirmed his disqualification for the judiciary of the Russian Premier League's matchmaker.
I am surprised that the efforts made in the fifth round of Spartacus, Dynamo, Turbin himself, or the leaders of the DSI, have not made serious conclusions about its low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private omissions of gross admissions fell from the horns of abundance.
For example, for 50 minutes, Eder's railroad will fall by hand in its Ahmat's "Ahmat" Rodolfo penalty area.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't do penalty checks.
- How do you estimate the episode involving Idov, who was at the 82nd minute when the ball appeared to be in his hand?
- I think there was an intentional defense attorney's hand in his ticket space.
Turbin was close to the moment, seeing the episode and his first assistant on the right.
That was also the moment of the stand-by judge Sergey Karasev.
Nevertheless, all three fell asleep, and the penalty was not appointed.
Thus, the account in the match is distorted, and sports justice has been distorted.
It was the same case where the judiciary had adhered and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
- For the 52nd minute, Turbin did not decide to remove Oleg Ivanov's guest's lawyer, who broke the rules against Krikhoviak, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he gave him a demonstration of applause.
What do you think of this episode?
Should I have shown the second mustard?
- At this point, Turbin and his first yellow card didn't show up at all.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of justice, that some teams put a penalty for violations like the episode with Idova and some of them don't.
What do you say to a football player?
- See what you mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
It wasn't given.
So the arbitrator doesn't put the second penalty in the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second point in double standards is that the judge sees who's playing.
I played Lokomotiv on Saturday, and Ahmata has serious claims to Turbin's work because the team has been compromised.
Matt Damon played the rape charge for Judge Kavanaugh at the SNL.
American actor Matt Damon played the US Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of the new Saturday Night Live season on NBC television.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at Senate hearings on rape charges.
The candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to his emotionality and details during his interview with Senator Amy Clobushar.
Cavanaugh, for example, repeatedly admitted his love for beer, but he stated that he had never been drunk before he had no memory.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on rape charges, Kavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
Damon also played these points.
I was just doing a lot of drinking and not thinking about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunken virgin anyone's ever seen.
Everyone knows it," said the judge in charge of Matt Damon.
Kavanaugh had previously been elected Supreme Judge of the United States.
Barbra Streisand discovered strange behaviour in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand said that her dead dog's clones were acting quite differently than the original pietome.
"They don't look alike.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul," the 76-year-old singer stressed.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old coton detulaire dog named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018 it was reported that the dog of Chihuahua species called Miracle Milly, which was called the smallest dog in the world, was cloned 49 times.
Specialists are working on cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
United States dollars thought about Russia's marine blockade due to oil and gas supplies
In the United States, Russia's maritime blockade can begin to gain an advantage in the world energy market.
The American authorities have fought so hard for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to Russia's marine blockade, which remains one of the world's major energy suppliers.
The possibility of a sea blockade was described earlier by the head of U.S. IMF, Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to world practice, the United States Ministry of the Interior does not perform police functions, but civil functions, including natural resources policies.
Therefore, Zinke’s statement was well within the competence of his leading agency, although there was no political adornment.
Addressing an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinka said that the US Navy controls maritime routes in the Middle East region and could block them if necessary.
Zinke said that the need could be linked to Washington’s desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world’s energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia was still receiving a lion's share of its revenues from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motivation for Moscow's revitalization in the region, Zinke is confident.
The Minister made it clear that the United States continues to expect leadership in the world energy market, becoming the largest oil and gas supplier.
To that end, Washington will have to squeeze Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes - an acceptable measure on that path, Zinke believes.
Kalmickian director gets a good turnout for the festival
Our fellow actor, Gogol Centre actor, Evgeny Sangadjiev and his movie "Harmony" ("Harmony"), was awarded special mention of the members of the jury of the sixth debut festival "The Movement", which took place in Omsk.
It is stated in the festival diploma that “this is a signal for the immediate response of major industrial players to the theatre cinema”.

The main prize in this competition was the painting “Jana is Anya the other way around” – the director's debut of actresses of Yosos the Gladys.
The focus of the National Film Festival on the Movement is on young cinemas, but not on the age of designers, but on the state of their spirit, desire and ability to take risks.
A graduate of the Elistin School of Arts named P. Chongushov and RATI-GITIS, Eugeny Sangajiev, meet all these requirements.
He is young, talented, creative, and creative in his pursuit of new, unusual forms of self - expression.

There's a club in Russia that I'm watching.
Former Captain Chelsea and Comparative England, John Terry, on why he attended the ninth round of Russia's "Spartak" - "Rostov" (0:1).
"I have a club in Russia that I'm watching.
I've been watching it for a while, and I've been curious to look at it.
I can't say that I'm a sick man because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartacus, and I want to apologize again for the decision made, which brings out the words of Terry on the sickling site of Chelsea.
Remember, "Rostov" with 18 points rose to third place in the tournament table, and "Spartak" placed on the fifth line with 15 points.
In the next round, the Red and White will play with Enise on 7 October and Valeria Karpina will be admitted to Orenburg by day.
The expensive violin was placed in a pawnshop for no price.
When a man in the town of Somerville (Massacucets), Lombard LBC Boutique and Loan, brought a violin for an old and unimaginable tool, a pawnbroker offered only $50.
But the experienced store manager, Dylan McDeremitt, suspected it to be an old and expensive tool, and consulted the expert.
It turns out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violinist Ferdinando Galiano and estimated at $250,000.
Only one violin tape is estimated at $16,000 to $18,000.
The investigation revealed that the violin had not long since been stolen from a city dweller, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
We don't know how the violin got to the man who put it in the pawnshop, but there's no previous encounters with the law.
The manager says that now all the pawnbrokers bringing the violin will ask to play on it to make sure it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round, the RPL is waiting for us with a fascinating contrast: Spartacus will take over at his stadium in the "Rostov" Tushina under the leadership of Valeria Karpin, a man who is known to be no stranger to the "national team".
This meeting is particularly hot because clubs now have the same number of points - 15, and they share 3 and 4 seats in the tournament table, falling behind the far-fetched Zenita and one point from "Bradnodar" who is playing with Dynamo tomorrow.
The red and white people are in a tough spot: the club is surrounded by idiotic scandals again, the Massimo Carrera team has recently flown into the League of Europe and has recently returned to the House of Ahmata.
After a derby from the CSKA, which ended in a fair no-one, Spartacus played Black Seas in Cuba with a minimum bill, and it was still too early to say whether Russia's most popular club had approached its exit from the crisis.
"Rost" three matches in a row couldn't win, but the defeats don't know five matches.
Let's see if we can get Karpin to extend a win-win series with such a principled match.
The previous meeting of the Karpin "Rostova" with Spartacus ended in favour of the capital team.
Start at 7:00.

Translator compares mentality between Russian and German
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples differs, but the few differences between them play little role in understanding.
On the International Translator ' s Day, 30 September, a professional synchronist, Burbel Sackse, spoke about this.
It has been working for more than 30 years on translations from Russian and English.
"The Germans like to plan things peacefully, and the Russians, as the proverb says, "long drive, fast drive."
But I think that, for understanding among peoples and for the work of an interpreter, this does not play a significant role," said a specialist in the comment “RIA Novosti”.
According to the translator, to understand that two countries do not care enough about each other to know history.
And in the future, said Sacks, Germany has no use ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that define our common destiny," she said.
The day before, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated that the country was trying to “engage” with Russia and support them.

The Lord helped Siberia today.
The head coach, Vitezia, Valeriy Belov, who was struck by Siberia (3:4) in the match of the KHL regular champion.
"College talked about Siberians, and I want to point out our painkillers," notes Belova's official website, "Vitizia."
"I hope they'll support it, too, because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
The game must have been that the Lord helped Siberia today because they were very rudely wrong, especially our leaders.
We actually lost the micro-game 0:3 of our leading leaders, so it was hard for us to pull out the match, even though there were moments.
But I'm still going to take the blame.
Because I guess we missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was a different team."
"It's a dirty piece of shit."
The audience is outraged by Agutin's choice of the Voice show.
The viewers of the Voice 60+ show accuse the teacher of Leonidas Agutin of being "scrupulous and insidious".
When he first learned the voice of his father, Nikolai Agutin, in his blind auditions, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not return to the executioner.
But his son's feelings took over, and he chose a relative as his team.
At that time, many thought it was a joke, but they forgave the teacher for his incompetence in the first phase.
But the joke was prolonged, and the father of the star was completely unjustifiably taking the place of more worthy performers.
Now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutin for such injustice.
Yesterday, we watched the show, and we were outraged by the rude and frank marching of our close relatives into the final staircase.
I had already doubted that Agutin would have the strength to keep his conscience from dragging his pope to the very first place," said Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larin in the TV Man programme.
Meanwhile, for his father's sake, Leonid Agutin "saw" the beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining this by what viewers still want to see in his father's show.
But, as it turns out, viewers want an objective assessment and to see in the finals truly talented performers, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"I'm sorry for the voice from Agutin's team. They've been sentenced."
"Last time, Agutin showed how much he loved the Pope, and today he was supposed to be a professional."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"Remove two talented people from the project and leave their pope who doesn't sing but whispers, what can you call a mentor?"
"He likes to sing Dad, throw him a concert in the Kremlin for his money, and see how many people come to this concert."
It's a Voice show, not a "Crickly Relatives" show.
"On Agutin's side, it was unprofessional."
"Then we have to propose on our own show to speak to the pope, not on the show that's made for the money of the 1 Channel."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took a place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless pope has to make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did a surgut worker with a great voice and a tambouri, while Pope Agutin was brought to the finale?
And then we all complain that on the stage and on the screens the same faces have been on for decades!
That's because you don't want to break through the commotion."
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
There's mud and commotion.
And the money in the family budget will be no extra!
The theatre of absurdity continues!"
Users also recalled that in one season of the traditional Voice, the son of Gradsky was released at blind auditions.
That's when the subway didn't get the son on its own team.
Moreover, he said, "Come on, get out of here, it's understandable."
Agutin's acting like a professional couldn't.

The scientist described the possible scientific programme for the expedition of RF to the Moon
The head of the Institute for Space Research of the Republic of Iran, member of the correspondent Mr. Anatoli Petruković, told RIA News about a possible programme of scientific research for Russian cosmonauts on the Moon.
He said that the scientific community was now working on the development of such work.
“No consolidated opinion yet”, the scientist stressed.
He noted that one option was the deployment of a low frequency radio telescope on the back of the Moon, which would avoid interference by the Earth.
"It is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to explore space sources of radio radiation," Petruković added.
He also believes that the Moon could be used for testing robotics, using local resources for construction.

An offended client dropped a basket of feces at 7-Eleven
Damian Simms, 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), which is called having a tooth on the manager of the 7-Eleven 24-hour network store: in May he exhibited it from the store for misconduct.
And I decided to avenge my enemy in the original way.
In the middle of the second night, he went into the store and dropped off on the floor and on some of the goods on the shelf with the contents of the basket.
There were feces and urine in the basket that Simms was "borrowing" from a nearby mobile biotual.

Russian pilot Williams Sergei Sirotkin commented on the result of the Gran Pri Russia race.
"I honestly don't want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn, I found myself in the middle of two cars that immediately hit me.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, the moment, right away.
He's in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the rest of us hit a pit stop, we'd get into clean air, and the pace would come back, but the rubber was gone.
Plus, he was struggling with his partner, and he was in contact with him.
I understand he was wrong a little bit.
We found ourselves in this situation on the most undisturbed route of the season, and there was nothing I could do, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," brings out Sirotkin RIA's words "Novelty."

President Shamil Tarpishev of the Federation of Tennisa Russia (FTR) commented on the removal of the Moscow footballers Denis Glusakov and Andrey Eshenko from training with the main composition after the barking of Masimo Carrera's chief coach, reports Sport Weekend.
Carrera's actions were completely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is unworldly nonsense.
I totally disagree with what Carrera's doing.
It only deepens the team gap.
First, these verses can be read and understood at any time.
I wouldn't react to that if I were Carrera.
Everyone has an opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to be buried.
If the Douches and Eshenko are lying, that doesn't mean they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to perceive the situation.
And it doesn't serve as a normal climate on the team.
Spartacus doesn't have a game today, so this situation didn't have to be blown away at all.
Maybe it was time to laugh about it together.
Spartacus has a lot of things wrong with different lines, and there is indomitability after the introduction of youth.
Relations within the team appear to be less optimistic than this match," Tarpschev is confident.
The two teams will be playing on September 30th and will begin at 7 p.m. Moscow time.
John Terry led the Chelsea youth team.
Syrian Educators Discuss Natural Technologies with Scientists
Teachers of the Sirius Educational Centre in Sochi, participants in the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists at the National Research Centre “Kurchatov Institute”.
The presentations were made in the context of the Global International Forum of Convergence and Natural Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and are available on the website of the educational centre on 29 September.
The lecture opened a documentary entitled “Kodi Kurchatova”, during which the President of the Kurtchatov Institute, a correspondent of RAN Mikhail Kovalchuk, described global challenges as the driving force behind the development of civilization.
The scholar's lecture is published on Sirius.
Schoolchildren have learned that modern technologies require enormous amounts of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such quantities.
According to the organizers of the forum, this problem will be addressed by the technology that young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of similar technologies, as well as the risks inherent in the creation of such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing; it is a tremendous good.
It's an explosive growth in medical technology, it's an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
In fact, the development of natural-like technologies is the technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There is a negotiable side, a focused intervention in human activity.
Risks are always.
There was a car, and people were dying under the wheels.
But they still use cars.
The dual nature of technologies is immediate.
I am creating a medical new technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction," the scientist REN TV quoted it as saying.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the meeting.
The Speakers were a candidate for physics and mathematics, the head of the Courchatov complex of the NIS-natural-similar technologies, the Kurchatov Institute, Julia Djakov, and the head of the Courchatov complex, Vjeceslav Demin.
The Sirius Educational Centre in Sochi was established by the Talent and Success Education Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure initiated by President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
The aim of the educational centre is to identify, develop and continue professional support for gifted children.
Previously, in September, it was reported that the Vissian Online Olympics on Information Security would be trained in Sirius.

Macedonia: no referendum due to low turnout
The referendum was to endorse the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country to Northern Macedonia.

But according to the EFE agency, only 34 per cent of the appearance in the Sunday plebiscite had not reached the constitutional threshold of 50 per cent.
However, since the referendum was only consultative, the authorities in Skopje may have decided not to give up the name.
Speaking shortly after the closure of the polls, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, a supporter of the republika, said that if more “yes” were to be cast, Macedonia would change its name despite the lack of a quorum.

Kemerovcan angered a flock of rams at the cemetery
On September 30, a report from an eyewitness on the well - known Kemer’s page on the social network revealed that horned animals wander freely around one of the local cemeteries.
The animals passed a large herd between the fences and the grass.
The commentators expressed differing views: one of the locals noted that there was no harm in the presence at the cemetery of the small horned cattle, and that their appetite might even help to clear the territory from the weeds and infestations of the grass, but some of the inhabitants of the town did not have to do with animal behaviour:
"These are graves, not pastures.
There's nothing I can do.
Of the rams, you will not say that they are despicable, but it is not a matter."
In any case, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem of animals in the middle of the cemetery had already been known, and the necessary measures would soon be taken.
Pushing and plunging, how's that?
There's no such thing as a long word.
That's right.
The word “touch” in the meaning “trap, exert influence, influence” only exists phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word “satisfy”.
We use that word, assuming it comes from the word "pressure."
But "push" and "pull" are not only close, but even in a sense opposite.
See for yourself.
To plough (church) means to satisfy someone or something.
Satisfying, pleasure is related words.
He used to have the meaning of "do not depend on anything, be self-sufficient."
The Old Slavic word for power and will.
Suffocation, smothering, totally different.
These words are truly frightening "parents": daos is "wolf," deyja is "dying" and twoidī is "tribulation".
The similar phonetic form of the words “pressure” and “sufficient” as well as the inevitable aging of the latter made them become contaminated.
So we have this very "d" that is used in writing through "a" that is better and not possible in terms of the processes of the origin and development of these words.
Well, that's right.
But the word is older, in its proper sense it is no longer used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word “suffering”.
You can also use the pressure structure, but remember, it's a chancellor.

After all, I don't think that's really affected the outcome."
"In Sochi it's very difficult to chase, the race is going to be a key moment?"
"Perhaps, yes, but you never know how it's gonna work out.
It's not going to be easy anyway, because our car is clearly slower than the Mercedes.

With the help of an operation in Syria, Russia has shielded itself from terrorists
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists were killed, 85,000 of them destroying the RF Air Force.
This was related to the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former head of the BSS, head of the defence and security committee of the Federation Council, Victor Bondarev.
It noted the high accuracy of the use of air-imposed means: Air-space forces have been and continue to strike precisely at terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed in Syria for three years, such as ammunition warehouses, reinforcements and headquarters.
Russian airmen have broken down jihadist defenses, making a decisive contribution to the promotion of Syrian government forces, reports Interfax.
According to Bondarev, however, the operation of our military in Syria has enabled Russia itself to shield itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the Arab Republic were under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IG, banned in Russia) and the Jebhat al-Nusru (prohibited in Russia).
According to Genstab of the RF Armed Forces, about 4,000 Russian citizens and about 5,000 post-Soviet nationals fought on the IG side.
It is only those persons who have been recorded, not including those who have not been identified, that is, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and prepared to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter our country freely.
Thus, said Bondarev, in Syria, Russia is struggling with international terrorism in distant places -- otherwise, it would “feel bad to us”.
Boris Johnson's phones and a number of British ministers have reached open ground.

According to the TV channel, several politicians received "unpleasant calls".
The technical problem has been addressed, and the use of the app is now safe.
We study the reasons for the failure and apologize for any problems raised," the Conservative Party said.
During the collapse, users could not only see confidential data but also edit information in the profiles of politicians and journalists.
For example, in the profile of Minister of Environment, Ecology and Agriculture, Michael Goova was replaced by a photograph of him in a photograph taken by the physician Rupert Murdoch.
Syria accuses the United States of supporting terrorism
The head of the Syrian MID Walid Muallem accused the United States and their partners of war crimes in Syria and support for terrorism.
The [Western] coalition had completely destroyed the Syrian city of Racca, destroying infrastructure and public services in the areas against which it was directed, and had committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These killings under international law are war crimes," he said.
According to Muallem, the United States and their partners provided “direct support to terrorists” because the objectives of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided with and implied “the sowing of chaos, death and destruction in their path”.
The head of the ILO also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria had almost been completed and that the country had become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intended to rid Syria of an illegal foreign presence, and priority would be given to Syrian partners in rebuilding the country.
In September, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savichenko, head of the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of Hostiles in the Republic, said that two F-15 United States F-planes had attacked the Syrian province of Deirez-Zor with prohibited phosphorous ammunition.
All charges were dropped by the United States.
The President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other States, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its sovereignty.
The Head of State made this statement during his visit to Harikovské oblast, commenting on the issuance by Hungary of his passports in Zakarpatje.
In protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our State.
As we respect the sovereignty of other States, we demand the same respect for Ukraine," said Poroshenko.
According to Poroshenko, as President, he will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are, in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the Head of State supported the position of the ILO in a passport scandal with Hungary, which is intended to expel the Consul of the country from the Coast.
“I fully share every letter that the MlD has said”, the President noted.
FACTS reported that on 19 September a video appeared on the network recording the moment of extradition to the Hungarian Consulate of Hungary to the Hungarian passports.
In doing so, they took an oath of allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Pavel Klimkin, said that the Hungarian Consul, who was on video with Hungarian passports, had to leave Ukraine either by decision of Budapest itself or would be expelled by Kiev.
It was also known that the Prosecutor ' s Office of the Zakarpatsky District had initiated a criminal case on the issue of Hungarian passports.
The incident is classified under “State treason”.

Putin had already visited Hakasiya in January this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president's favorite places to rest.
More than 10 million Syrians have been refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict that has been taking place in Syria for seven years.
About five million people fled to other countries, particularly neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Damascus now believes that military action is nearing completion, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
This was said by the Foreign Minister of Syria Walid Al-Muallem, speaking at the UN: "The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues to work in areas destroyed by terrorists, returning them to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country that they have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that have made life more difficult and deprived of their means of livelihood.
The Syrian authorities also called upon the international community to facilitate the return of refugees and to allocate funds for this.
Meanwhile, the United States and the European Union have refused to provide assistance to Syria, stating that a political solution to the conflict must first be found.
"Folkswagen" fully acknowledged its guilt in the "disalgeate" in January 2017.
In December of last year, Oliver Schmidt was sentenced to seven years in prison, one of the managers of the company’s U.S. unit.
The losses of the concert are estimated at at least 25 billion euros.

In February, companies stated that commitments had already been met for 83 per cent of vehicles, so the programme would be completed in advance.
Folkswagen is trying very hard to compensate for the losses and restore clients' trust.
For example, the management of the concert has recently been re-examined and there has been an announcement of major restructuring and major changes in the management system.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if the German cities ban diesels on their streets: such power was granted in February of this year.

Metropolitan Ilarion compares Kiev's decision to rename UPC with Fascist actions
The head of the synodal Division of External Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Ilarion, compared the name of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the Fascists against the Jews.
“It is the same that in Nazi Germany, to put a yellow star on the Jewish side, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and it is for that purpose that the bill has been created,” said the Metropolitan on television channel “Russia-24” (quote under “Interfax”).
In his view, this step would have the most serious consequences right now that the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is at an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control of the UPC and “put it out of the law”, the clergyman said.
“It’s the Ukrainian Church, and the church’s believers think they are Ukrainians, they’re patriots of their country,” he added.
Previously, it was known that members of the Supreme Council were working to implement Bills No.4128 (to change the subordination of religious communities), No.4511 (with special status of religious organizations) and No.5309 (to change the name of religious organizations).
The latter implies the name of the OPC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
Vice-President of the Pomavian laurel called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
Deputy Saint-Uspensian laurel Metropolitane Vladimir called for the protection of Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
His address to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UPC) believers was published on Saturday on the home site.
In various times our predecessors and family members had to practice their faith and their spirit to protect their sanctuary.
Given the situation and the information we have and the threats that are spreading, we can see what we will have to endure," the Metropolitan said.
He asked for support -- prayerful, moral.
Also, the Deputy laurel stressed that it is likely that "your physical presence will be needed".
The priest added, "The grandsons of Lenin, by spirit, are in danger of execution, and therefore we shall protect our sanctuary."
To whom the fate of the Potayan laurel, the Orthodox Ukrainian and the world sanctuary, must be prepared to protect it, the reference is made.
Metropolitan urged us not to go after those who led the believers astray.
The OPC has the canon status as defined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 by the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to impose on the novelty patriarch and other Roman Catholic pope Bartholomew.
A new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us.
And we are pleased with the status that our church has," noted the deputy laurel.
He recalled that since October 1990, OPC had been independent and fully self-sufficient in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
What else do we need, Tomos?" - said the Metropolitan Pocajevsky Vladimir, urging believers and all citizens to ask themselves, do they have other denominations of Tomos, are they independent of the Vatican?
The believers have somehow figured out the kind of temple they're going to.
But someone wants to sow hatred and strife again.
Some will be consumed by the envy that the dome is shining on the temples they want to destroy," the priest stressed.
Potaev lavre is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
There is a laurel at the top of Pocajevska mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopol.
The first historical record relates to the beginning of the 13th century.

Good luck will come if we continue to play in that direction."

Automobile is a good team.
The tournament table makes sense that the team is playing correctly.
Good hockey, good atmosphere, both in the arena and in the city.

United States dollars increases the production of opiates in Afghanistan
A sharp increase in the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September was much to be said in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nikolai Patruschev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, fighters have unleashed a real terrorist war against the authorities of the State and the peaceful population of the country.
The current year has become record for the number of bloody attacks that have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans," Patruschev noted.
Afghanistan's woes didn't start yesterday.
Following the attacks on 11 September 2001, Al-Qaida (prohibited in the FF) was declared the main enemy of the United States of America.
It hasn't been a month since America and the NATO allies launched the Operation Enduring Freedom.
It's been 17 years.
A multi-thousand American contingent and now in Afghanistan.
And peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
U.S. troops are being driven to take dozens of their bases.
As they may, they are redeemed from fighters for money, only if they are not touched.
The Government of Afghanistan controls less than 40% of the country ' s territory, according to Patruschev.
50% - from the Taliban (prohibited in the RF).
Another 10% - behind IGIL terrorists (prohibited in the RF).
But that's why they grow there fast.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-malifate in Central Asia - exactly what they did not find in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be doing just fine.
It is also true that in 17 years of American drug production (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
Colossal growth in areas planted with opium poppy and multibillion dollars in profits.
Macedonians are prepared to vote in a referendum on EU and NATO accession, subject to a change in the country's name.
The agreement on the re-namement of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as the outcome of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbour's right to be called Macedonia, viewing as such an attempt at a single Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovski, a political scientist: “Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is entitled to a better future, a hope for social change.
And Greece will assert its right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone happy.”
The country ' s name is being changed by the ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
The conservative opposition and the president of the country, George Ivanov, are opposed.
According to journalist Tsvetina Chilimanov, Macedonia has no point in joining the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government, headed by Zaeva, is forced from the outside to change the country's name.
But that decision would have negative consequences.
First of all, I will lose my sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain a sovereign country in the Balkans."
Fei Dulgery, Euronews: The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice that Macedonian citizens will make will determine not only the Balkans but Europe as a whole.”
