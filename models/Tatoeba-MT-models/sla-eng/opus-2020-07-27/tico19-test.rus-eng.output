Rapidly increasing cumulative morbidity of coronary infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and in Britain between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The cumulative morbidity of coronary infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the countries of the European Union / Economic Zone and the United Kingdom, thus confirming that despite different stages of their development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive treatment offices, it is necessary to increase the level of preparedness for COVID-19 patients who need treatment and, in particular, intensive therapy.
On 31 December 2019, in Ouhan, Province of Hubei, China, several cases of pneumonia have been reported in unknown etiology.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the infection was caused by a new type of coronavirus, now known as the heavy respiratory syndrome acute (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-COV-2 has been referred to as a coronary infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild, i.e., pneumonia-free or pulmonary tract infections, with the majority of patients recovering.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops in a more severe form with the need for hospitalization and in the remaining 6% takes critical forms when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4 per cent.
This study analyses the trends in the cumulative morbidity of COVID-19 in each European Union (EU)/Economic Zone (EEA) country and in Britain and compares them with the trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in Britain with data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and currently, in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing according to the same dynamics as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the issue of Eurosurveillance of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spittery (Spitery) and his colleagues reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease in Europe that met the criteria for WHO determining the existence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were registered in France on 24 January 2020, all three of whom were returned from Ukhań Province of China.
As at 15 March 2020, COVID-19 infection cases were detected in all 30 EU/EEA and British countries, with 39,768 infection cases and 1,727 deaths, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 fatal cases, being reported by 31 December 2019, amounted to 1 Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative morbidity of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily data on the number of registered cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world received from official sources such as the ministries of health of those countries, national and regional health administrations and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in the circulation of COVID-19 to the EU/EEA and to the United Kingdom and to compare them with data from Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases, COVID-19 was estimated at the estimated cumulative morbidity rate of COVID-19 for 14 days, taking into account the usual current of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in Britain for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We have also submitted a cumulative number of cases recorded in each country as at 8:00 on 15 March 2020, compared with data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Development trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and in Britain
The 14-day development of COVID-19 contracted cumulative morbidity in EU/EEA countries and in Britain in general was in line with the trends observed in Hubei Province of China (Figure 1).
The cumulative morbidity of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK as a whole began to rise approximately 21 February, and a sharp rise in this figure (additional material) took place on 28 February 2020.
This was due mainly to the rapid increase in the number of registered cases in Italy, but also in all other EU/EEA countries and in Britain there were similar trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and in Britain compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these figures, the total number of cases already registered as at 8:00 on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in Britain is comparable to the number recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results indicate a rapid increase in recorded cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in Britain.
The observed trends in COVID-19 cumulative morbidity suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite different stages in different countries, differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities, and perhaps different criteria for the recognition of cases and different patient selection rules for the analysis of the availability of COVID-19, including the “improving” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected regions in Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive therapy, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive therapy offices in these regions had already been as complete as possible.
To date, data on the admission of patients with COVID-19 to hospitals and/or intensive therapy offices in the EU/EEA are only available for 6 per cent and 1 per cent of cases respectively (not reported).
However, such information needs to be systematically collected to supplement the current monitoring data for the number of recorded cases and the number of deaths.
According to a 2010-2011 study, there is a significant variance in the number of cocts in intensive care units and intensive care units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in terms of 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
In the sixth updated report of the ECDC on risk-assessment results for COVID-19, the scenarios for modelling the loading of health systems ' resources with estimates for hospitalization of COVID-19 infected in each EU/EEA country and in Britain are presented, where the risk of lack of accessible beds in intensive care units exceeds 90 per cent.
Since cases are grouped in certain EU/EEA and British regions, hospitals and intensive therapy offices tend to serve the population of a specific territorial group, information on cases of infection and number of storks in intensive therapy units is recommended as far as possible at Level 2 Units of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive therapy offices should be prepared for a long-term contact infection scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive therapy, which, for example, can be observed in affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest report of the ECDC on risk-response assessment, the prompt, proactive and integrated approach, which follows the transition from deterrence to minimalization, is of great importance to deter the spread of SARS-COV-2, since, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision makers and hospitals may not be able to reflect, take and adjust their response, as appropriate, unless such measures are taken in advance.
The risk assessment report also listed public health measures aimed at mitigating the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can intensify their monitoring efforts to slow the spread of SARS-COV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, in the coming days or weeks of the health system in other EU/EEA countries there will be a flood of patients in need of intensive therapy.
The outbreak of coronary infection 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), type 2 (SARS-COV-2), has become a tragedy for mankind: more than 3,000 people have died at present in China and other countries of the world, and more than 80,000 have been infected.
Like the GARS-COV homologous virus, which caused the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be passed from flying mice and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and lower than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than young and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing subject of research is proposed in this article.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, forecasting of the current and prevention of the disease.
While the answers to many questions are yet to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate the dangerous disease.
The festival of the New Year of China, which ended on 25 January 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese who were urged to stay at home for many weeks after the outbreak of the new virus infection.
In view of the high level of similarity with the Coronavirus (COV), which triggered the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 called the SARS-Cov-2 virus and the accompanying disease a coronary infection on 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Ouhan and spread rapidly throughout the country, and then nearly 50 other countries around the world.
According to data on 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases were detected, more than 40,000 patients recovered, and more than 3,000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “an enemy number one for society” and is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have been published in less than two months, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etaeology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus separated from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to synthesize research results in a new and rapidly developing subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other underlying coronary disease, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, which occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts at this time of prevention and forecasting of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been found to be non-lethal pathogens and mainly cause about 15% of the total respiratory disease 4.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered high-pathogenic human coronarys, i.e. severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV) coronavirus, which caused the outbreak of diseases initially in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other States with the horrendous level of disease and mortality.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of a coronary infection in the history of mankind.
As shown in Figure 1.1, reports of clusters of unknown pneumonia were first reported to the National Health Commission of the PRC, Ukhan, on 31 December 2019.
A genetic sequence of the virus was released seven days later.
On 15 January 2020, the first death in Ukhahn was registered.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it became known that medical personnel were infected, which enabled the transmission of the virus from a human being.
On 23 January, Ukhahn was quarantined, and the city public transport was discontinued.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of this disease, it was noted that 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed coronary infection had direct contact with the marine product market in Ukhun, which was considered to be the starting point for the spread of the infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of the coronavirus was a global public health emergency.
By the time the report was prepared, the disease had spread throughout China and had already penetrated some 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scope and degree of risk of outbreaks still need to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented the following updated epidemic development (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ulBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-Cov-2 was infected by all age groups, but was mainly affected by people between 30 and 65 years of age.
Nearly half (47.7%) were infected over 50 years of age, very few were under 20, and only 14 were still 10 years old.
SARS-COV-2 infection among men above (0.31/100 000) than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was distributed mainly to clusters in Hubei Province and in nearby regions.
On average, 5 (2-9) days were observed prior to the development of COVID-19 symptoms.
The incubation period was an average of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
From the time of symptoms until death, 9.5 (4.8-13) days were on average.
The baseline reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By 23 January 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected, which coincided with the large-scale transport operations prior to the celebration of China ' s New Year.
The mortality rate among confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were: gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a sub-family of large shell viruses containing one sensory RNA.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and deltas, of which alpha- and beta-coronaviruses are known to affect humans.
In the event of damage by SARS and MERS, glycoprotein (S) is associated with cellular receptors of the angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
Cytoplasm is released by the virus RNA genome; after replication of the virus genome, the genome RNA, together with the glycoproteins and nucleocapsis proteins, generates virion containing vesicles, which then merge with the membrane cell, releasing the virus.
The first reports on the genomic sequence of SARS-Cov-2 appeared on 10 January 2020.
It has been established that SARS-COV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, whose 99.98% genome coincides with 10 consecutive samples collected in the first outbreak of disease in the Juanan Sea Product Market.
Genetic SARS-COV-2 closer to SARS-COV than MERS-COV.
By means of an enlightening electronic microscope, the SARS-COV-2 particles were found in the ultratonic cuts of the human respiratory tract.
The human enzyme ACE2 has been identified as a receptor for SARS-Cov-2, as well as for SARS-COV.
However, S-protein SARS-COV-2 is less associated with ACE2 than with SARS-COV, which explains that SARS-COV-2 causes patients less severe disease than SARS-COV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also generate previously unknown short-lived protein, codified orf3b, and classified protein encoded orf8.
The orf3b of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may play a role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou (Zhou) submitted reports on the cryoelectronic tomography of the full-dimensional ACE2 enzyme structure with permission of 2.9 in combination with the B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They discovered that this complex, which included open and closed formations, was collected as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two S-proteins, which is evidence for the diagnosis and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-COV-2 infection.
Origin and Intermediate Master
The source of both SARS-COV and MERS-COV were known to be flying mice from which the virus was transmitted to the person through the tube and camels, respectively.
Through the phylogenetic comparison of SARS-COV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was established that the first owners of SARS-COV-2 were flying mice, since the new virus was 96 % identical to two SARS coronaviruses, namely SL-CoVZX45 and SL-COVZX21.
However, it remains unknown which species has become the intermediate host, which has led to the virus being able to overcome the visual barrier and infect the human being; the route of transmission is also to be determined.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that the carriers of the virus from flying mice to man had become snakes, which had resulted in homologous recombination in S protein.
According to their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou assumed that pangoline is a long-term mammal who feeds on ants and is often used in traditional Chinese medicine — potential intermediate masters of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 per cent genetic similarity between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 1 per cent distributed between the two genomes is still very large, so it is considered that no final results with specific evidence are yet available (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-Cov-2 are still largely unknown.
Under laboratory conditions SARS-COV and MERS-COV may survive 48 hours in the dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature below 20 °C and 40 to 50 per cent humidity.
SARS-COV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heating up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; it can effectively block the activity of the virus through ether, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chlorinated disinfectants, peruxic acid, chloroform and other gyros containing solvents, but not chlorhexidine.
The human population as a whole has no immunity to SARS-COV-2, so people are sensitive to the new virus.
There are currently no data on detailed immune response studies on SARS-Cov-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Usually, the host virus will first recognize the congenital immune system by means of recognizable receptors (ORDs), including C-type, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus induces inflammation, dendritic cell maturation and type I synthesis, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of the macrophages against viral antigens.
However, thanks to the N-label SARS-COV, immune response may be avoided.
Soon, an adaptive immune response is involved in the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of B-cell specific antibodies, and CD8+ T-cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T-Helperes produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protective cells.
However, the coronavirus may inhibit the functions of the T cells by causing their programmed death.
The humoral immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies removed from a recovering patient were neutralized by MERS-COV.
On the other hand, the immune system's hyperreaction entails local education of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst scenario, lead to polyorganisms and even death.
The SARS-COV-2 infection, which is characterized by clusters, is more likely to affect older persons with associated pathologies and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who have immune system disorders.
According to data from the first 425 infections in Ukhun, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-COV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases revealed an average of 3 days incubation period, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study based on demographic data of 8,866 cases showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the timing of quarantine measures based on the most accurate estimates of the duration of the incubation period, thus preventing the spread of the virus to those infected with the disease without a symptom.
Common practice was 14 days quarantine for people who had contact with the virus or infected with the virus.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often a high temperature, which can be the only manifestation or be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, headache, headache, throat pain, dizziness, chest pain, diarrhoea, fat and rye.
Some patients have had effusion and/or hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high fever and/or symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis even if no pathology is found in the chest.
The demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following symptoms: 98 per cent high temperature, 76 per cent dry cough, 55 per cent shower, and 3 per cent diarrhoea; 8 per cent of patients required artificial ventilation of the lungs.
Similar results were obtained from two recent studies of cases of domestic infection and transmission of the virus from unsymptomable infections.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in the study of patients with MERS-COV, whose main symptoms were also high temperature (98%), dry cough (47%) and shower (55%).
However, 80 per cent of these required artificial ventilation of the lungs, which was much higher than for patients with COVID-19 and corresponded to a higher mortality rate than for MERS than for COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also experienced diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high fever (99–100%), dry cough (29–75%), shower (40–42%), diarrhoea (20–25%) and throat pain (13–25%), and artificial lung ventilation requires 14–20% of patients.
On 14 February, the death rate of COVID-19 was 2 per cent and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Compared to this, the death rate from SARS to November 2002 was 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, the population survey conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37 per cent of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
In an earlier study, the baseline reproduction (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was set at 6.47 at a 95% confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23 while R0 for SARS-COV was only 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-COV-2 with MERS-COV and SARA-COV on symptoms, mortality and R0 is shown in table 1.1.
The above figures show a higher ability of SARS-COV-2 to spread than MERS-COV and SARS-COV, but the mortality rate for new virus infection is lower than the last two.
Thus, it will be much more difficult to contain the SARS-COV-2 epidemic than MERS-COV and SARS-COV.
Cluster expression often occurs when an infection occurs within a single family or group of people gathered together for any reason or who are together on a transport, such as a cruise liner.
Patients often traveled to Ukhahn or other affected regions, lived there, or contacted the infected or sick during the last two weeks prior to the beginning of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people may be carriers of the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and the patients who have been cured from the hospital may once again be carriers of the virus, and that is an alarming signal to an extension of quarantine.
At an early stage, patients have normal or decreased leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had leukocyte lymphoma < 4×109/L, including leukocyte levels < 1×109/L, as well as elevated aspararagine aminotransferases and viraemia.
In some patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myoglobin were found in the blood, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cell deposition.
Patients with severe disease had a D-dimer level, a fibrin breakdown product present in the blood, and the lymphocyte count had been steadily reduced.
In most patients with COVID-19, an x-ray scan of the breast cell revealed pathologies characterized by uneven eclipses on both sides or darkenings on the type of “mattal glazing” in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lesions and acute respiratory disease (PRI).
In the development of ODS, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant disruption of gas exchange.
Pneumocyte dysfunctions of types I and II lower surface-active compounds and increase surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of light to expand and increasing the risk of light-fall.
Thus, the worst results of the x-ray study often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated pneumocyte secretion, gualic membrane formation and interwoven lymphocytary infiltration, and multinuclear synsythic cells in mild patients who died from the disease were consistent with the pathologies of viral infection and OCR and similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The method of detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19 by means of a polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCA with reverse transcriptase).
However, given the high level of false results that could accelerate the pace of the epidemic, clinical manifestations have been diagnosed in China since 13 February 2020 (not relying solely on the CDC with reverse transcription).
The diagnosis of SARS was similar.
Thus, in order to effectively diagnose, it is critical and it is necessary to combine the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray research.
On 14 February 2020, a team of specialists, led by Mr. Feng Zhang, described the SHERLOCK methodology for the detection of SARS-COV-2; this method allows the detection of synthetic fragments of SARS-COV-2 at a density of 20 × 10–18 moles/l to 200 × 10–18 moles (10–100 copies per microlitre of reference sample) by means of indicators less than an hour without complex equipment.
This new methodology, if tested successfully on clinical drugs, can greatly enhance the sensitivity and convenience of the tests.
Due to the lack of experience in countering an previously unknown coronavirus, physicians can generally provide patients with COVID-19 only with supportive therapy while attempting to use any therapeutic methods used or offered in the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunodeficiency donors, steroids, plasma recovery patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of recovering patients was suggested to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to combat the virus.
During the initial stages of SARS-COV-2, it is mostly mild and may be less striking by other organs that express ACE2, e.g. gastric and thyroid tracts and kidneys.
However, disruption of work and refusal of breathing organs are the main threat and cause of death of patients.
Thus, in order to facilitate symptoms and save lives, support for respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, which are assigned depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extra-corporal oxidation membranes (ECMOs), a modified method of extra-pulmonary circulation used to treat life-threatening cardiac or respiratory insufficiency.
In addition, the maintenance of hydro-salt balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock and protection of vital organs are essential for patients with SARS-COV-2.
Cytokine storm is known to be the result of a hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
The cytokine storm is a form of a systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNα and MCP-1.
These cytokines provoke immunocytes to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main causes of the development of ODS and polyorganism deficiency.
In the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in patients in severe condition, suppression of immunity is essential.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies serving as interleukin-6 inhibitors, were used to treat cytokine storms.
Other treatments for cytokine storms based on immunosuppression include modulation of the immune response to control of T cells; blockade of cytokine production of IFN-
In order to reduce the severity of the effects of inflammatory processes on the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immunosuppressors.
However, high dose steroids do not benefit from treating severe lung injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly exacerbate the prognosis.
However, short courses of small and medium-dose corticosteroids are recommended for use with caution when treating patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
There is no proven effective antiviral therapy at the time of writing.
However, the internal introduction of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has proved to be effective in treating the American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and the Marburg virus.
Later, remedesvir also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with single RNA, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these data, Gilead provided this drug composition to China to carry out a steam research on patients infected with SARS-COV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were suggested as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhoea, fat, rye, liver attack and other side effects.
Care should be taken to monitor the interaction of these medicinal products with other medicinal products that have been prescribed for patients.
Plasma of recovery patients and antibody development
Blood loss in infected patients has long been used to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect the healthy population.
And in fact, the blood of recovering patients often contains a relatively high amount of antibodies to combat the pathogen.
The antibodies are in the immunoglobulin produced by B-lymphocytes to control pathogens and other alien objects; they recognize and target the individual pathogen molecules.
On the basis of this assumption, plasma from the blood samples of a group of patients treated with COVID-19 was removed, which was then introduced to 10 severely ill patients.
Within 24 hours their symptoms improved, inflammation and viral load decreased, and oxygen blood saturation increased.
However, in order to propose mass use of this method prior to specific therapy, there is a need for an unverified examination and an inexplicable explanation.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effect, some plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can over-incentivize the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which, given toxicity, poses a potential risk to life.
Concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma to treat patients in critical condition takes a lot of time.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to identify the B cells of recovering patients and determine the genetic code of active antibodies or to screen for effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
So we can move immediately to mass production of antibodies.
For thousands of years, Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on the combination of multiple components of the formula, the composition of which depends on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most effective components are still unknown or have uncertain effects, as it is difficult to identify and verify these components or their optimal combination.
At present, due to the lack of effective specific treatment of COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild and moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from severe disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen (Lian Hua Qing Wen) capsules were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The largest proportion of recovery patients with COVID-19 was found in a number of provinces in China, where Chinese traditional medicine was used in the treatment of 87 per cent of patients, including Ghana (63.7 per cent), Ninsia (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in the province of Hubey, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only approximately 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19, the lowest proportion of patients was recorded (13 per cent).
However, this is a fairly rough comparison, as the assessment should take into account a number of other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their disease.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment exclusively with Western medicine and combined treatment in Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the normalization of body temperature, the elimination of symptoms and the provision of medical care under the conditions of the hospital was significantly lower in patients who were treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in patients who were treated only by Western methods.
The most surprising fact is that the proportion of patients who began to worsen symptoms (from light to severe) was markedly lower in the group treated by the combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine methods than in the group treated only in Western methods (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and security of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more closely-controlled research carried out in more and more regions.
It is also of interest to obtain, as far as possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine methods or their combination.
Patients suspected or confirmed by COVID-19 generally have a strong fear of acute and even fatal disease, and people who have been quarantined are also bored, alone and extremely irritated.
In addition, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
At the early stages of the outbreak of the SARS virus, there were reports of a number of psychiatric conditions, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor agitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal behaviour.
Compulsory monitoring of contacts and quarantines, which are among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people's anxiety and feelings of guilt about the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma in their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons suspected and in contact with them, as well as to all the other people in need.
In the context of psychological support, multidisciplinary psychiatric support teams should be established, regular and accurate information on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans should be provided, and professional electronic devices and applications should be made available to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in stopping the transmission chain from animal carriers and infected people to susceptible owners and are often used in addition to the antiviral therapy used to contain new viruses.
Work has been done to establish S protein-based vaccines aimed at developing long-lived and highly active neutralising antibodies and/or protective immunity to SARS-COV.
Live, weakened vaccines from SARS viruses have been developed in animal studies.
However, prior to the start of clinical studies, the effectiveness of these potential vaccines should be further determined in the natural environment when they are administered to older patients, the model of lethal doses infection and the degree of protection against zoonose virus infection.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and since then no new cases have been reported.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of diseases caused by the MERS virus, emerging in the Middle East and spreading to other regions through the conservation of zoological sources in endemic habitats, continue to occur.
In order to combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using the inactivated virus, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein elements, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 for persons without immunity is an urgent and critical task that requires a solution to contain a raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long (average 18 months) required for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic modification of the coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical flow of disease from thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
Therefore, it is critical for health authorities to develop a prognostic model of disease in order to prioritize their actions, especially in areas where there is a lack of resources.
Based on current clinical studies, the following factors may affect or be associated with the forecasting of disease flow in patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor in predicting the disease caused by SARS, which was also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between the ages of 30 and 65, 47.7% of whom are over 50, according to the above-mentioned study, 8,866 cases.
Patients requiring intensive therapy were more likely to have underlying diseases and complications, and they were significantly older than those who did not require such therapy (on average 66 years versus 51 years), which suggests that age is a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: infection of SARS-COV-2 among men is higher than among women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Disease and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop acute myocardial and arrhythmia damage.
Cardiological events also led to the death of patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-COV-2 may also be associated with ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may result in liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are closely interlinked and can distort results.
Deviations identified in laboratory studies: C-reactive protein levels in the blood reflect the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential prognostic factor of disease flow, response to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested that the relationship between the C-reactive protein level, the severity of the disease and the forecast for COVID-19 be taken into account.
In addition, an increased level of lactatidehydrogenase, asparaguin aminotransferases, alanine aminotransferases and creatinine may be predicted.
These enzymes are largely excreted in various organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are excreted in tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: to predict the results and complications of treatment with COVID-19 along with other factors, data from x-ray studies of the breast cell and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account.
The use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immune agents commonly used in infectious diseases as additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Because corticosteroids have been widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, avascular osteonecrosis has developed in many of the survivors, leading to life disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if steroids are required to treat patients with COVID-19, they should be administered in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: as described above, in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress because they often have to endure long quarantine periods, cope with high degree of uncertainty and observe the death of their relatives and other patients.
In order to relieve the stress of such patients and to help them return to normal life, psychological consultations and long-term support must be carried out.
According to population studies so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tracts, SARS-COV-2 virus, like other conventional cold - disease coronaviruses, can successfully reproduce in the upper respiratory tracts and cause weak symptoms or not cause symptoms at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients who have an early stage of the disease or who have not yet completed the incubation period may, while living their normal lives, spread the virus on a significant scale, which significantly hampers the epidemiological control.
However, the transmission of SARS-COV was considered to occur when patients were severely ill, with most cases not occurring at an early stage of infection.
Thus, today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is more difficult to control.
China is currently working hard to declare a universal quarantine in Ukhahn and neighbouring cities, as well as an extended quarantine regime for almost all the population established to stop the SARS-CoV-2 virus proliferation chain.
While these measures cause great damage to the economy and other aspects of the country ' s life, the number of newly identified patients is declining, which suggests a slowdown in the rate of spread of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak of disease will end by March, and the drowning phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter (Paul Hunter) and his colleagues calculated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looked much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group led by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) developed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and assumed that SARS-Cov-2 could defeat two thirds of the world's population.
The Team of Canadian Specialists reported that SARS-COV-2 was detected in nasal and throat swabs taken from patients recovering and discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical flu-like disease.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the strategy currently applied may have had an impact.
According to initial projections, Ebola fever was to strike up to a million people and cause the death of half a million patients.
But the strict quarantine and isolation of the disease eventually led to control.
It is likely that, like the SARS-COV virus, the infecting ability of the SARS-COV-2 virus may weaken, and over time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus co-existing with man.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, as well as possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in potassium, which means that there is also a possible oral-fecal mode of transmission.
According to one recent study, 41 per cent of the 138 people studied may have been infected in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously detected diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Serious precautions should therefore be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even those who are in contact with patients or those who are infected.
The first line of defense in order to reduce the risk of infection is wearing face masks; both surgical masks and class N95 Respirators (series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks do not allow microcaps to spread in the air from potentially infected individuals and to sit on the surfaces from which they can be transmitted.
However, only class N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) can protect from inhalations of virions of 10 to 80 nm, they pass only 5% of the viruses; SARS-Cov-2 virus of the same size as SARS-COV and both of them of approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks combined, medical professionals who directly contact patients must wear N95 (Series No. 1860s) masks instead of surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical personnel should wear a protective robe on the figure to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Virus can also get into the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor contracted SARS-COV-2 despite wearing a class N95 mask; the virus may have fallen into his system through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health workers should also wear transparent face shields or closed-type protective glasses.
The entire population in the affected or potentially threatened regions is urged to wash their hands more frequently by means of disinfectants, to try not to leave the house while respecting self-insulation, and to limit their contact with potentially infected people.
The distance to the patient is deemed to be about three feet away.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-COV-2 virus was previously unknown to mankind, its high level of similarity to SARS-COV, reported on 7 January 2020, should have been an alarming signal to China, taking into account its experience during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020 did the Director of the Ouhan Disease Control Centre reassure citizens, saying that the new virus has low contagion and limited reproductiveity in the transfer from person to person and that preventing the spread and control of the disease will not be a problem.
This statement has greatly reduced social tensions, especially when the entire country was preparing for the celebration of China ' s New Year, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be kept within Ukhan with minimal losses.
China ' s health authorities can learn this cruel lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more careful public statements as each word is taken into account by citizens and may affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) better monitor and respond to unusual information coming from clinics rather than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take stronger measures to contain the potential epidemic in its early stages rather than to reassure the public; and (4) more frequently to carry out targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and to regularly monitor and improve the response system.
A COVID-19 outbreak, caused by a previously unexplored severe second-type acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2), began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease covered all China and at the time the document was drafted, it spread to 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a SARS recidivism occurred at the outbreak of COVID-19.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are relevant to the control of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of serious cases and mortality among older persons is also higher than among young people.
The SARS mortality rate is higher than that for COVID-19 (10.91 % compared to 1.44 %).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is unsymptomatic, while patients with SARS tend to infect the environment only in severe cases, so it is more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-COV-2 is spreading much faster and larger than SARS-COV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative conventional tests for SARS-COV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, cured patients can show positive tests for the virus again.
This greatly increases the risk of the spread of the virus.
In the light of this rapid advancement of COVID-19 studies, some critical issues remain to be resolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the detection of a 96 per cent homologue between SARS-COV-2 and two SARS-like mouse-like coronaviruses, we still can't argue that SARS-COV-2 was infected by flying mice.
What animal became the intermediate species that passed the virus from the original master, such as flying mice, to the human?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely interrupt the transfer path, and the epidemiological situation may deteriorate at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-Cov-2 is associated with ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter respiratory cells and induce subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with ACE2-producing cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve in the process of transmission from person to person?
Will it lead to a global pandemic, will it also disappear as SARS, or will it periodically repeat such flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Zoonic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the development of coronaviruses (CoV) and their carriers, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses (HcoV) caused mild disease, such as common colds.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have altered our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening the exposure to human coronavirus can be.
The emergence of severe acute second-type respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 has once again attracted attention to coronaviruses and surprised us with a high transferability, but less pronounced pathogenicity of the virus than the SARS-CoV parent virus.
A human coronary infection is a zoonose, and understanding its zoonotic origin will be very useful.
Most of the human coronaviruses occur from flying mice for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoirs of some human coronaviruses are also known.
The identification of carriers directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
A study of the interaction of animals carrying coronaviruses can also shed light on the pathogenesis of the coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as their zoonotic origin and means of inter-application.
It is important to note that we have a comparison and comparison of different human coronaviruses with regard to viral evolution and genetic recombination.
In this context, the current disease epidemic caused by the coronavirus found in 2019 (COVID-19) is also being addressed.
In addition, the conditions necessary for the successful replacement of carriers and the impact of the virus evolution on the severity of the disease flow are noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive polar RNA.
These viruses with the largest RNA-containing genome virus in the range of 26 to 32,000 nucleotides were named because of their form, which resembles the crown when treated under an electronic microscope.
From the point of view of the structure, the coronavirus contains unsettled genomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are broadcast into pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins.
These polyproteins are further processed in order to generate 16 unstructured proteins identified by nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains an open-label reading framework for structured proteins, including schipogen protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Other lines of coronaviruses also contain a number of linear acidification proteins.
Based on the differences in the sequences, the protein\ crownaviruses are divided into four types (alpha, beta, gamma, and deltacoronavirus), with most of the human coronaviruses being divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha- and betacoronaviruses is flying mice and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, the coronavirus has continuously overcome inter-species barriers, and some of them have evolved to human-threatening pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
These include HCAV-229E and HCOV-NL63 human alpha coronaviruses.
The remaining five betacoronaviruses include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV) coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
Human HCAV-229E, HCAV-OC43, HCAV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 are usually associated with symptoms of light form such as cold and (or) diarrhoea.
Unlike them, SARS-COV, MERS-COV and the recently discovered SARS-COV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively higher number of patients with a higher probability of acute respiratory disease (PRI) and symptoms.
The first string of human HCOV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample of patients suffering from cold disease in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has accumulated more detailed knowledge of HCV-229E and HCOV-OC43 viruses, which cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that the infection was generally considered harmless by human coronavirus.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in the current history; more than 8,000 people were affected and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus (2019-nCOV) discovered in 2019, which was subsequently renamed SARS-COV-2, is the trigger of the current coronary infection of 2019 (COVID-19), which, as at 3 March 2020, killed more than 3,120 lives, with more than 91,000 people infected.
An alarming signal has been received, and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-COV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have zoonotic origins, their sources are flying mice, mice, or domestic animals.
Numerous data sets show in favour of the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from flying mice, to which viruses have been well adapted and have no pathogenic properties, but demonstrate a wide range of genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic left China and the world with a severe medical, scientific, social and moral challenge.
The study of the zoonotic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will make it possible to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting inter-visual transport.
It may also indicate or speed up the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplification medium SARS-COV-2, which is very important to prevent the recurrence of the disease in the future.
This review provides an overview of zoonotic origin, inter-species transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we identify and consider the following common feature: the source viruses from which human coronavirus occurs are usually not morbid for their reservoirs, but are of a pathogenic nature after inter-visional transmission to the new carrier.
We are also analysing the evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which the increase in transmission is often accompanied by weakening of pathogens.
In the same context, the results of the current SARS-COV-2 outbreak are also considered.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before strain B814 of the HCV-229E virus was first derived from a sample of the nostalgic cold patients, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including Indians, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
Table 1 provides a brief and informative history of the detection of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCAV-229E virus was derived from samples taken from the respiratory pathways of patients with infectious upper respiratory distress in 1966; the virus was subsequently adapted to reproduction in the lung cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with the HCV-229E virus had cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general insufficiency and sore throat, with a high temperature and cough of 10 to 20 per cent.
Later, in 1967, the HCV-OC43 virus was removed from the organic culture and subsequent serial passage into the brain of mice.
The clinical signs of HCV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCV-229E infection, the symptoms of which are indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
Both the HCAV-229E virus and the HCV-OC43 virus have worldwide spreads and are generally transmitted in wintertime in moderate latitudes.
The main incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of disease.
According to a study by volunteers, normal colds of light form developed in healthy people infected with the HCAV-229E virus.
Few patients with reduced immunity experienced severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the “atypical pneumonia epidemic”, has become the first well-documented human pandemic in the history of mankind, and the disease has been caused by SARS-CAV, the third of the human coronavirus detected.
The first case of SARS was identified in the Chinese province of Guangdun at the end of 2002.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases of disease and 774 deaths were documented and the disease spread across many countries and across continents.
Without regard to superactive spreaders, it was estimated that any patient could infect about two more; the incubation period ranged from 4 to 7 days; and the peak of viral load was 10 days.
Patients infected with SARS-COV initially experienced muscle pain, headaches, fever, general malaise and morbidity, and among the later symptoms were resuscitation, coughing, and respiratory failure.
Lymphopenia, liver problems and elevated creatinine are the widespread deviations from the SARS standard.
Patients with SARS also experience diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophages.
Approximately 20-30 per cent of patients subsequently require intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
Other organs, including gastrointestinal tracts, livers and kidneys, may also be infected in such a difficult situation, which is usually accompanied by cytokinic storms, which may be fatal, especially for patients with reduced immunity.
For the first time, the virus was removed from the open biopsy of a minor relative of the patient who had come to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to study human coronaviruses.
At the end of 2004, HCOV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
At first it was found that it mainly affects young children, older persons and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
For the disease caused by HCOV-NL63, there are manifestations such as dizziness, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchiolite.
Another independent study described the removal of the same virus from the nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy in the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was detected in the Netherlands, but it is indeed widespread.
It is estimated that HCV-NL63 accounts for approximately 4.7 per cent of the prevalence of respiratory disease, and the peaks of the disease occur at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also referred to as krup.
HCOV-HKU1 was allocated in Hong Kong in the same year to 71-year-old male hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitium.
In addition to extraneous pneumonia and bronchiolite, HCV-HKU1 is associated with an exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCAV-229E and HCOV-OC43, the HCOV-HKU1 virus, causing respiratory diseases of light form, has been detected worldwide.
All of these four human coronaviruses, which cause extra-cellular infections, have been well adapted to humans, and their mutations, involving highly pathogenic diseases, are generally unlikely, although the incidents were also unknown, as a rare example with a more virulent subtype of HCOV-NL63, which has reportedly caused serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Usually, by acquiring the ability to transmit effectively and to remain human, these human coronaviruses are becoming less virulent or pathogenic.
The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first introduced in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from a mild 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal insufficiency.
Most laboratory-confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia, imported cases have been recorded and distributed through occasional secondary cases of infection in close contact.
Another secondary outbreak of 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), both of which have progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal insufficiency, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by human-borne coronaviruses.
Over 30 per cent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and rheumatism.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of high-fatal Middle East respiratory syndrome (34.4 per cent) have been reported and MERS-CoV is considered one of the most lethal viruses known to man.
Between mid-December 2019 and the end of December 2019, Ouhan of the Province of Hubey of China identified clusters of patients with pneumonia, which are now associated with a type 2 severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) infection caused by severe respiratory syndrome.
The World Health Organization has announced that the continuing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-COV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been referred to as “coronavirus infection 19” (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases have been recorded worldwide, with an estimated 3.4 per cent mortality rate.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2 per cent and outside it is 1.2 per cent.
SARS-COV-2, like SARS and MERS, is causing severe respiratory infection, characterized by fever, cough and withdrawal.
Some patients also experience diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to rapidly switch to acute respiratory failure.
Despite the similarity of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-COV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has more ability to transfer than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
SARS-COV-2 has been reported to be unsymptomatic, indicating the ability of the virus to spread rapidly throughout the world.
As a result of the comparison and comparison of SARS-COV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, important similarities and differences are identified.
First, human-borne coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease caused by them.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Secondly, in terms of the severity of COVID-19 symptoms, is found between SARS-COV and four human coronarys that cause extraneous infections (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, the occurrence of SARS-COV-2 infections is similar to that most frequently observed with human coronarys causing extraneous infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-COV, a small subgroup of serious cases can be identified, although the ratio here is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transfer of SARS-COV-2 also highlights the interesting patterns that are characteristic of both human coronarys causing extra-cell infections and SARS-COV.
On the one hand, the transferability of SARS-COV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses causing extraneous infections.
On the other hand, it is still necessary to verify whether the transferability of SARS-COV-2 is decreasing with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. infection of each next person), as in SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Finally, like other human rootoviruses that cause non-embolic infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the samples of the sludge.
We still have to answer the question of whether the fecal oral route of the SARS-COV-2 transmission is as important (at least in some circumstances) as in SARS-COV.
Of particular interest is the possible seasoning of SARS-Cov-2, which is characteristic of human coronarys that cause extraneous infections.
Nevertheless, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the specificities of SARS-COV-2, including transmission, motility and sustainable distribution after human transition.
All four human coronaviruses, causing non-embolic infections with mild symptoms, have been well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, they may well have adapted to these four human crowns.
In other words, both could be called the only survivors after human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
Human rootaviruses caused by serious diseases in humans and people whose human coronavirus caused serious diseases simply did not survive.
In order for this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in the human body sufficiently to accumulate adaptive mutations that counteract the constraints of the carrier.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-COV-2 outbreaks continue and the more people will be infected, the greater the chance that the virus is fully human-adapted.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop human transmission by quarantine or other infectious disease control activities.
For many years, there have been four extra-hospital coronaviruses among the population that cause common colds in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require animal reservoirs.
SARS-COV and MERS-COV have not adapted well enough to human beings, and their human transmission cannot be maintained.
They need to maintain and reproduce in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek out vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or accelerant carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features such as SARS-COV/MERS-COV and four HCOV extra-cell viruses.
It's very easy to transmit like an extracurricular HCAV, at least at the moment.
But it's more pathogenic than the extracurricular HCOV, and it's less pathogenic than the SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to man and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCOV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, reinforcing and reservoir carriers of HCOV viruses.
An animal is an evolutionary carrier of HCOV if it carries a nearby ancestor with the same high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
An ancestral virus is usually well-adapted and non-pathogenic in this medium.
Similarly, the carrier-reservoir is constantly carrying HCoV for a long time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of the HCOV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCOV was only carried into an intermediate medium just before or about the time it was carried to a human being, it was not well adapted to the new medium and often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an accelerant carrier, allowing the virus to be replicated and then passed on to people by increasing the extent of the infection.
HCoV may carry a blunt infection if it cannot withstand a transfer inside the intermediate medium.
On the contrary, HCV viruses can also be adapted to the intermediate medium and even establish long-term endemicness.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that SARS had contact with hunting and hunting animals (wild) in the history of the patient.
Further studies of seroprevalence have shown that animal traffickers have a higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-COV than the population as a whole.
The Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and the ostensible dog in the markets of live animals have become the first established carriers of viruses similar to and almost identical SARS-COV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all cigarettes in the markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it has been reported that the Himalayan cives living in nature or on farms and not entering markets have in most cases not been determined by SARS-COV, which makes it possible to conclude that Himalayan cives could serve only as an intermediate amplifier, rather than a natural SARS-COV tank.
It is remarkable that since 80 per cent of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it is not possible to rule out the possibility that multiple types of small mammals can also serve as intermediate enhancers.
They all appear to be blunt carriers of the SARS-COV virus.
A follow-up search of the natural animal carrier SARS-COV has identified the nearby CoV of Flying Mouses, which has been identified as having been associated with the atypical pneumonia of HKU3 subcellular flying mice (SARSr-Rh-BatCov HKU3) and which is present in the Chinese horseshoe flying mice.
These mice are positive for antibodies to SARS-COV and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCOV HKU3.
These and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92 per cent of the same homology of nucleotide sequences as SARS-COV.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that flying mice had become carriers of new human pathogens.
A number of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-COV) have also been detected in mice, but none of them except one that denotes WIV1 cannot be isolated as a living virus.
The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that VIV1, obtained from the test of volatile mice, uses ACE2 of flying mice, a tube and a human as a receptor to enter the cell.
Curiously, the serums of SARS healing patients could have neutralized VIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest cousin SARS-COV in flying mice, dividing 95 per cent of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally considered that WIV1 is not a direct PARS-COV parental virus and that flying mice are not a direct SARS-COV reservoir.
The philosophical analysis refers to MERS-COV as the same group as the CoV-HKU4 of flying mice, and the CoV-HKU5 of flying mice.
CoV-HKU4 flying mice and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptyl dipeptidase-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The sequences of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to the sequences of betacoronaviruses of flying mice detected in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CAV virus has been found in wild flying mice.
The nucleotide homology of MERS-CoV and its immediate relative, CoV-HKU25 of flying mice is only 87 per cent.
So flying mice could not be the direct reservoir of MERS-CAV.
On the other hand, research in the Middle East has shown that single-tailed camels are seropositive to neutralising antibodies specific to MERS-COV, as well as the camels of Middle East origin in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was removed from the nasal mascara of single-tailed camels, which further confirms the role of camels as true MERS-CAV reservoirs.
It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected by MERS-COV had minor symptoms, but massive virology.
It is remarkable that infected camels have isolated the virus not only by respiratory means but also by fecal oral means, which is also the primary means of separating the virus from flying mice.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome have not been in contact with camels prior to symptoms and are likely to refer to human transmission or transmission through unknown channels, including unspecified species of animals that are carriers of MERS-CAV.
The nucleotide homology SARS-CoV-2 for 96.2% coincides with the CoV RaTG13 of flying mice assigned to the Asian horseshoes of Rhinophus affinis.
As in the SARS-COV and MERS-COV cases, the variation between SARS-Cov-2 and RaTG13 is too great to be attributed to parental relations.
That is, flying mice could not be the direct SARS-COV-2 tank carrier unless in the future, almost identical mouse coronaviruses are found.
The direct carriers of the SARS-COV-2 virus are expected to be among the wild species sold and killed in the Ughan offshore market of marine products, with many primary cases of COVID-19, indicating the likely case of transfer from the animal to the person.
A number of recent studies based on metagenomal sequencing concluded that a group of vulnerable mammals known as pangoline (Manis javanica) could also carry parental betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2 strain.
The homology of nucleotide sequences of these new pangoline coronavirus genomes is 85-92% consistent with SARS-COV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with nucleotide sequences being identical to about 90 per cent.
They are classified in two sub-differences of viruses like SARS-COV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a domain (RSD) receptor closer to SARS-COV-2 with a 97.4 per cent amino acid sequence.
On the contrary, the RSD strains SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more controversial, despite the higher degree of homology of sequences throughout the genome.
In an earlier study of diseased pangolins, it was also reported that viral contigants were identified in light samples, which were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, other methods of assembly and manual processing were used to obtain a sequence of the genome, which includes about 86.3% of the full-dimensional viral genome.
The possibility that pangoline was one of the intermediate carriers of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded.
However, due to the diversion of sequences between SARS-COV-2 and pangoline betacoronaviruses related to SARS-COV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-COV-2 from pangoline.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangoline betacoronavirus associated with SARS-Cov-2.
The evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 for flying mice, pangolins and other mammals is not yet established.
While the highest homology of sequences was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangoline betacoronavirus, related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 had the highest homology sequences throughout the genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between pangoline betacoronaviruses related to SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV-2 is related to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal favours a recombination between the pangoline betacoronavirus of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, recombinant use is widespread among betacoronaviruses.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-Cov-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCV viruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 viruses is also studied.
Philogenetic evidence shows that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E can occur from flying mouse coronaviruses, while parental viruses of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 are found in rodents.
It was reported that the flying mouse coronavirus, named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and identified from the North American three-colored bat, showed close kinship with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E is genetically associated with another mouse coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate carrier could also be camels.
For the sake of clarity, the current knowledge of the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in figure 1 and in table 2.
Philogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the events of the inter-application of HCAV in the history.
When the HCAV-OC43 virus was transmitted in 1890 and people were infected by domestic animals, a pandemic of respiratory infection was registered.
The history of the intervisional transmission of HCOV-229E is not so clear.
Alpha coronaviruses of flying mice, close-born HCV-229E, have been detected.
There is an alpaca alpha coronavirus between them.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from flying mice.
First, it was the people, not the alpaca, who were able to contact flying mice in the common environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the alpaca.
Secondly, alpha coronaviruses of flying mice, related to HCV-229E, are diverse and non-pathogenic in flying mice, while alpha coronavirus alpaca caused respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha coronavirus was not detected in wild animals.
Thus, the probability that the alpaca received the HCOV-229E-related alpha coronavirus should not be excluded from humans.
In fact, flying mice are a direct source of pathogenic human viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is not surprising, therefore, that flying mice could directly pass HCAV-229E to people.
On the other hand, while alpha coronaviruses of flying mice could serve as a gene pool of the HCAV-229E virus, alpaca and single-tailed camels could be intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just like the MERS-COV virus.
MERS-CoV provides an excellent example of inter-visional transmission from flying mice to single-tailed camels and from single-tailed camels to man.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-COV from flying mice is known for its initial identification and was subsequently confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is obvious that flying mice provide a rich pool of viruses for inter-species exchange of genetic fragments and inter-species transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and flying ability make bats “ideal spreaders”.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to single camels decades ago.
It has been well adapted to these camels, which from the intermediate carrier have become a stable and natural reservoir.
These animals have the MERS-CoV virus which causes a very light disease and is characterized by a relatively low frequency of mutations.
Its occasional transfer to a person is an accident, and the person remains a deadlocked bearer of MERS-COV, as its transfer is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transfer of MERS-COV, the role of pangoline, if any, in the transfer of the SARS-COV-2 virus is different.
In particular, pangoline betaconaviruses are highly pathogenic to the pangoline.
They may be blunt carriers of betacoronavirus related to SARS-COV-2, as well as tubes in the case of SARS-COV.
Future studies need to confirm or exclude several possibilities for the transmission of the SARS-COV-2 virus from animals.
First, flying mice may be a reservoir for the SARS-COV-2 virus, which is almost identical to SARS-COV-2.
Humans can share the environmental niche with flying mice by taking a look or cutting apart the carcasses of these animals.
Secondly, the pangoline may be one of the intermediate amplifiers in which the SARS-CoV-2 related virus recently came into contact.
Humans are infected with the virus by cutting carcases and eating wild animal meat.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-COV-2.
The survey of domestic and wild animals on antibodies is justified.
Thirdly, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-COV-2 may have occurred in the third form, which was in contact with both flying mice and pangolins.
The search for animal origin SARS-COV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to different types of animal carriers, the three main factors on the part of viruses also contributed to cross-sectional barriers.
First of all, they have a relatively high mutation rate in replication of RNA.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the calculated frequency of coronavirus mutations may be considered “moderately high” with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 per year on one section 2 depending on the adaptation phase of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have corrective exoribonuclease, the removal of which results in extremely high frequency of mutations and weakening or even incapacity.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of Remdesivir suppresses the replication of coronaviruses by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising against SARS-COV-2, which needs to be verified in clinical trials.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is nearly a million times higher than that of the carriers.
In addition, the frequency of mutations can often be even higher if the coronavirus is not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-COV with high mutation frequency, the frequency of SARS-COV-2 mutations appears to be lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
This virus is believed to have already adapted to another carrier close to the human being.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this applies also to MERS-COV, well adapted to single-tailed camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that vaccines and antivirals from SARS-Cov-2 will rapidly lose effectiveness as a result of a genetic drift.
Secondly, a large RNA gene in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in the genome modification of mutations and recombinants, thus increasing the likelihood of inter-species co-generation conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses, subject to conditions.
This is supported by the numerous unique open-label reading and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3′-end genome.
Thirdly, thanks to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch matrices during the replication of RNA.
At the time of transcription of the DNA of the coronavirus in the carrier, which serves as a mixing vessel, there is often a switch.
Highly dimensional full-dimensional and sub-genome RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found both in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43 and in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and BatCOV-HKU9 of flying mice.
Interoperability of the transmission virus
In addition to the three virus factors listed above, the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor is another key factor important for inter-application.
In this article, a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in inter-visional events, is the SARS-COV.
Based on a comparative analysis between the SARS-COV strains of human beings and cinnamons, SARS-COV is considered to be rapidly adapted to different carriers, especially with regard to S-SDS mutations.
In general, RSD S-protein interacts with the cellular receptor and the antibody response of the carrier is highly selected.
SARS-CoV RSD is amino acids, from 318 to 510, on S1 for the introduction of the virus into the cell, which is associated with human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (APF2) and its correceptors.
The SARS-CoV virus RSD is able to recognise the APF2 receptors of different animals, including mice, civetos, mice and oesophageal dogs, making it possible to transmit the virus in an intervidual manner.
In fact, only 6 amino acids that differ from human viral strains and tubes were detected in RSD, of which 4 are in the receptor binding motive for interaction with the ATP2 receptor.
SARS-Cov civets have K479N and S487T mutations in RSD, which may increase the affinity of the interaction of chipic protein with the human receptor APF2.
In other words, these two substitute amino acids may be of particular importance in adapting the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-Cov-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-COV.
The 30 per cent difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in S1 protein S leads to a change in the binding affinity of protein S to human APF2.
Indeed, the study using a cryoelectronic microscope said that the affinity of this connection was 10 to 20 times higher than that of the APF2 human and S protein virus SARS-COV.
It would also be interesting to know whether any other correceptors were required to transmit SARS-COV-2.
It is surprising that HCOV-NL63 is also associated with APF2, but with another segment of S protein.
There are many other HCV receptors, such as N aminopeptidase for HCAV-229E and 9-O-acetylsyl acid for HCOV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after inter-species transfer from animal carriers.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of the inter-visional transfer of HCOV is also controlled by other dependency factors and vehicle restraints.
The diversion of these protein carriers between humans and natural HCoVs reservoirs, such as flying mice, single-tailed camels and rodents, may constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
For successful inter-visual transmission of HCV viruses, dependency factors have to be usurped and subject to vector restriction factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can result in impartial full-geneous screening of dependency factors and media restrictions for SARS-COV-2 through the latest CRISPR technology.
New HCOV: back to zero
The diversity of mouse coronaviruses provides a wide range of opportunities for new HCAVs.
In this sense, the mouse coronavirus serves as a genetic pool for HCAV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also a driving force for the evolution of HCOV and serve two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-encoding genes has potential for radical modification of virus phenotypes.
Among SARS-COV acidic proteins, ORF8 is considered to be important for adapting to humans, as SARS-COV-related mouse viruses have been isolated but have been found to codify diversionary proteins of ORF8.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide delimitation characteristic of SARS-COV coronaviruses was detected.
This division breaks the ORF8 into the ORF8a and the ORF8b, and it is considered to be an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of the media.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible combinations with alpha- and gammacoronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent polymerase.
Localization of recombinants was also defined in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, the epidemic MERS-CoV was shown to have been recombined between different lines, which occurred in single camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events have also been observed in other HCOVs, where HCOV has been recombined with other coronary animals in its non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unintentional changes in viral genomes, which is likely due to the release of the virus from selective pressures such as the immune system of the carrier.
An example of such effects is the loss of a fully dimensional ORF4 in the HCOV-229E prototype strain due to a bi-nucleotide fraction.
While the intact intact ORF4 reading box can be seen in mouse and camel flying viruses related to HCOV-229E, alpha coronavirus alpaca demonstrates a single nucleotide insert, which leads to a shift in the frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCOV is also due to the pressure of selection on their reservoirs.
In the case of flying mice, faint symptoms or their absence have been recorded by the coronavirus, suggesting that there is a mutual adaptation between the coronavirus and the flying mouse.
Flying mice were found to be anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the inflammatory response in flying mice effectively reduce the pathology caused by the coronavirus.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in flying mice has been suppressed by adjusting the inhibitory receptor for natural kill cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the main class 1 HVC molecules.
Moreover, the high level of active forms of oxygen, which is ensured by the high metabolic activity of flying mice, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus by simultaneously affecting the reading of exoribonuclease, thus creating pressure for the generation of strains of the virus that are highly pathogenic when inserted into the new medium.
More pathogenic strains of the coronavirus can also evolve due to recombinant activity, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the carrier.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the last twenty years.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause light symptoms from their reservoirs, such as flying mice or camels.
They are confidently replicated without causing a strong immune response from the carrier.
This is the secret of why we see symptomless carriers, and what causes serious human infections.
Severe symptoms are mainly associated with the hyperactivation of immune response and cytokine storms, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the loss of the lungs.
On the contrary, the immune response of the unsymptomable carriers does not involve replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy for non-insecting immune response may have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-COV-2.
Flying mice have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least during the initial phase of SARS-COV-2 infection should have a beneficial effect.
In addition, NLRP3-inflammasoma has been disrupted by bats.
Therefore, the inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasom by MCC950 may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-Cov-2 follows the overall pattern of SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
While betacoronavirus of flying mice was found, with a 95 per cent nucleotide homology equivalent to SARS-COV, there is also a mouse coronavirus whose nucleotide homology coincides with SARS-COV-2.
Although it has been found that the flowers and other animals in the markets carry viruses, identical SARS-COV, directly intermediate carriers for SARS-Cov-2 have not been installed.
Pangolin betacoronaviruses have been found, remarkably homologous SARS-COV-2, suggesting that pangoline could serve as one of the intermediate carriers or that fragments of pangoline betacoronaviruses could enter the final version of SARS-COV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-Cov-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by man.
The coronavirus has attracted universal attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-COV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in flying mice and other animals radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HcoV animal reserves in human transfer.
Convincing evidence showed that SARS-COV, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 came from flying mice and were handed over to the person through intermediate carriers.
If the SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between people and flowers in the markets, the closure of wild markets and the destruction of civvies could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of various lines of pangoline betacoronaviruses, the nearby SARS-COV-2, pangolins should be removed to prevent the zoonotic transmission of the infection from the food markets.
However, whether SARS-COV-2 is transmitted to a person through pangolins and other mammals and how this may happen remains the task of future studies.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in single camels.
These camels serve as an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and in Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the proliferation of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
In order to halt the periodic outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, combined with other infectious control measures.
Since we can't eliminate these viruses, there may be new genotypes that cause outbreaks.
Various zoonose coronaviruses are circulating around the world.
In particular, there is a wide variety of zoonose mouse coronaviruses.
There are many opportunities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which will in future lead to new coronaviruses that are more easily transmitted and/or more lethal to human beings.
To reduce the number of human and animal contact, a culture of wildlife consumption in some parts of China should be avoided.
Following severe tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and a plan for responding to such situations are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new territories can be seized.
While many mouse properties are conducive to the spread of viruses, if people are taught to stay away from them, human contact with flying mice and other species of wild animals can be minimized.
In order to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, permanent epidemiological surveillance of mammals is required, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of coronaviruses from humans and future outbreaks of diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the environmental niche of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
In the puzzle of zoonotic origin SARS-COV-2 there are still some fragments missing.
First, if flying mice passed the SARS-COV-2 virus to the pangolins, it is interesting to see where flying mice and pangolins divide the same environmental niche.
Secondly, if flying mice play a more direct role in the transfer of human beings, it is necessary to determine how humans have come into contact with flying mice.
Thirdly, if the role of a true intermediate carrier is played by a third mammal, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, flying mice and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, can be susceptible to SARS-Cov-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it is a flying mouse, pangoline or other mammals, it is expected that in the future SARS-Cov-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified by their natural carriers.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolution path SARS-COV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria need to be updated for “disposed cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a brief handbook on the diagnosis and treatment of a new coronary infection in 2019 (2019-nCOV), which provides information on our experience and provides reliable recommendations to combat this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronary infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has gradually increased based on current research and clinical experiences; thus, diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for “disaster cases” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the document “Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19” (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the PRC.
In December 2019, there was a new outbreak of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCOV), which is now officially referred to as coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus itself was referred to as “severe acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-COV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the infection of SARS-COV-2, my team developed a brief guide and published it on the Internet on the website of Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
This publication has attracted great attention.
While noting that COVID-19 is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge have been gradually enhanced through ongoing research and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, between 16 January and 3 March 2020, seven editions of the Recommendation on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19, published by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), with some of its provisions substantially changing.
Recently, comments were made on our recommendations in the work of Zhou (Zhou) with co-sponsors, and they contained simple diagnostic proposals based on the clinical experience already available.
This work added new practical evidence to our recommendations, and provided valuable background information on the pandemic that covered the world.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19 (test seventh version) and current studies, their work needs updating.
In accordance with the seventh edition of this document (from 3 March 2020), in order to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the case of suspected disease, one element of the characteristics of epidemiological history and two clinical manifestations of disease must be combined:
Epidemiological History: (1) History of movements or whereabouts in Ukhahn and its vicinity or in other settlements where cases of COVID-19 have been reported 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) History of contacts with sick, infected SARS-COV-2 (with positive test based on nucleic acids); (3) History of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Ukhan and its surroundings or from other settlements where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) History of contact with confirmed disease groups (≥ 2 cases with high temperature or respiratory symptoms recorded in 2 weeks in small areas such as home or apartment, classroom, classroom, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) High temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) External manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) Total leukocyte count is normal or reduced with reduced lymphocyte counts at an early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis of confirmed disease should be based on a suspected disease with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-COV-2; (2) full-generated virus sequencing shows high homogeneity with respect to new coronaviruses; (3) positive results of the serotest for specific SARS-COV-2 antibodies IgM and IgG; or change of test results with negative effect to the SARS-COV-2 antibody IgG specific, or titre increase of at least 4 times on the recovery phase of the corresponding acute phase indicator.
It may also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020), a real-time PCR test was added for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples.
Pathogenic screening of blood was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth editions (8 February 2020) and then the seventh edition added the need for serological evidence.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers looking for an optimal set to detect nucleic acids at rapid diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of samples taken from respiratory pathways, including blood sampling, which improves the availability of different samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive results of tests for specific antibodies in the evidence criteria.
However, there is increasing evidence of the need for caution in treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without pronounced symptoms.
Thus, the road map presented in Zhou and others should be updated as it classified persons without clinical symptoms as “low risk” groups.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practices and studies.
Finally, we hope to obtain more direct evidence and call on readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “disaster cases” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations made in those countries where they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner with a view to providing effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 - daily maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 per day.
That's the largest death toll of the virus a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the registered infections included 114 current cases, as well as 33 recovering patients who were at home.
In total, 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director, Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora, told us that four men and one woman were victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two deaths were over 60 years of age, two from 51 to 60 years of age, and one from 41 to 50 years of age.
She also reported that the two deaths were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
The clinic officer informed the local news agency, Anadolu, that Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, was treated at the Kuwaiti Maytry Clinic.
On Saturday, the Minister for Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obadul Quader, said that the work of public transport would be discontinued for longer periods than originally planned until next Saturday.
Public transport had been suspended since 26 March and had to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods — medicines, fuel and food — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were registered in Bangladesh on 8 March by two persons who returned from Italy and by the wife of one of them.
As of 19 March, the three people had recovered.
SARS-COV-2 has hit a million foreign infections worldwide
According to the University of Jones Hopkins, on Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-COV-2 infection worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 people were killed by COVID-19.
The country came on the same day that the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi and the first case of death of the coronavirus was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries that had not recorded cases of coronary infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding the 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronary contamination were reported, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, referring to data from the University of Jones Hopkins, reported that more than 1,000 deaths caused by coronary infection were recorded in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced stronger measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobjanin extended the regime of self-insulation of citizens of the city until 1 May.
Earlier, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russians throughout the country, despite self-insulation, would receive wages up to 30 April.
The Parliament of Portugal voted in favour of an extension of the state of emergency for 15 days; the results of the vote: 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote in favour.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, whereas the former curfew lasted only from 3 hours a day to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to introduce curfew from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio State, Mike DeWain, announced that the regime of domestic self-insulation in the state was extended until 1 May.
Shops in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased once
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian Woolworths and Coles stores have reduced the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased once in all shops in the country to two and one packages, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a restriction on one package.
These restrictions have been reported in the cassage announcements, as well as on the Facebook page.
It is reported that citizens have begun to make emergency supplies because of the fear that COVID-19 might lead to a general self-insulation regime.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper to one package.
Previously, on 4 and 5 March respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this number by 4 packages.
In its press release of 8 March, Coles reported that with a restriction on four packages, “in many stores, toilet paper is still bought too quickly — one delivery within an hour”, and called such demand “unprecedented”, while ALDI on Facebook, published on Tuesday, called this trend “unforeseen”.
According to representative Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
Costco's shop in Canberra last week also limited this number to two packages.
In order to fill in the deficit, Coles began to order larger parties from suppliers and increased delivery rates, Woolworths ordered additional shipments while ALDI made reserves for a special early sale on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailer Association, reported that the Retailers were trying to fill up the stocks, but this was hampered by restrictions on local authorities regarding the timetable for the carriage of trucks.
It expects an increase in the cost of products, as suppliers try to meet demand, but less and less profitable offers are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to stock depletion, some stores could not conduct media shares.
In a report from News.com.au by Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in retail from the University of Queensland in technology, said that stores fill stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper was a bulky commodity, so the number of warehouses was small, and after the sale of the goods, the long series of shelves remained empty, increasing the lack of stock.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if Poles could be filled and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand sanitizers could be placed on these regiments in large quantities, buyers would probably not panic,” said Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of redesigned toilet paper, Who Gives a Crap, reported the completion of stockpiles.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex and Solaris Paper manufacturer also reported that they work around the clock to provide sufficient quantities of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne declined due to the lack of customers on the week of Labor Day, some real estate sellers started offering free toilet paper to the first bidders.
The Thursday edition of the daily NT News in Darwin included an eight-page tab designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to the ABC Australia report of 3 March, stores were reluctant to impose restrictions on the quantity of goods purchased, stating that they were not planning to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also benefit from increased demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, gallantery, hand washing and flour.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, on Sunday evening, it was noted that the online store of the British Ocado supermarket also limited the sale of Andres toilet paper by two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-COV-2.
Despite the fact that the term “pandemic” only describes the extent of the disease and not the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that action is needed by Governments of countries:
“All countries together are still in a position to influence the progress of the pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are involved in the detection, testing, treatment, isolation of the disease, monitoring of the occurrence of the disease, as well as the mobilization of their nationals,” explained the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanam Gebreisus.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming prevalence and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented”.
He said in his interview on CNN in February that “no respiratory virus other than influenza has been traced from its origin to continuous global spread”.
Mr. Gebreisus expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.
We have also never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled.”
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak of this disease a public health emergency of international importance and then assigned it a new status — a pandemic.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: “This is only the beginning, it will be worse.”
According to Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported on Thursday in the world and over 4,600 died.
The coronavirus pandemic 2019-2020 is currently a pandemic of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Ouhana, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020 an emergency situation of international importance in the field of public health was declared a pandemic, which was subsequently recognized on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is 4 per cent, while in the world it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first occurrence of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but may also range from two to fourteen days.
Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The recommended preventive measures include hand washing, cough cover, human distance, identification and self-insulation of people suspected of being infected.
Authorities worldwide responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk control and closures.
The pandemic has resulted in serious global socio-economic consequences, transport or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as a widespread shortage of products exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional level in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 per cent of students worldwide.
Disinformation about the virus has started to spread on the Internet, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other East and South-East Asian nationals, or people who resemble them externally, as well as other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of virus spread have been observed.
As a result of the reduction in the number of travel and closures of heavy-duty enterprises, air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of Ukhahn, the capital of Hubei Province, China, reported cases of pneumonia for unknown reasons, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Infectious cases were mainly related to the Juanan offshore market, so the virus is believed to be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that triggered the outbreak of the disease, known as SARS-COV-2, is a recently opened virus that resembles the big mouse coronaviruses, pangoline and SARS-COV. It was later discovered that the first case of the disease arose on 1 December 2019 and that it did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the infections registered in December 2019 were related to this market.
On 13 March 2020, it was suggested that the first case of infection had occurred with the 55-year-old resident of Hubay Province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases of infection in China had declined but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and that the number of new cases of infection outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases of infection in China itself.
The number of cases of disease may be significantly reduced, in particular due to the number of cases with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases of infection among young people had been reported, with patients aged 19 years and younger making up less than 2.4 per cent of the world ' s cases; the United Kingdom ' s chief academic adviser, Patrick Wallance, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until effective group immunity was established in the country ' s population.
Statistics include cases of contamination of persons who have been tested at COVID-19 and whose test has proved to be positive under official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, an official policy had been adopted to prevent testing of only minor symptoms.
A study published on 16 March showed that, by 23 January, 86 per cent of cases of COVID-19 infection had not been found in China and that such unregistered patients had become a source of infection for 79 per cent of registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of cases of actual contamination in Italy was significantly higher than the number of cases recorded.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive number of infections (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that this figure may be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are recovering well.
In other more complex cases, the time from the onset of symptoms to the time of death ranged from 6 to 41 days, with 14 days at most.
As at 10 April 2020, some 97,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths occurred in persons over 60 years of age and 75 per cent of those killed had associated diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official data on deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually included data on deaths of patients with positive results from the COVID test carried out under the official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not take into account the dead who have not been tested — for example, in the event of death at home, in the homes of the elderly, etc.
The incomplete data on Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID 4-5 times.
The U.S. Press Secretary for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges: “We know that [the reported number of deaths] is below the actual”, and his words are confirmed by reports of some isolated cases in the United States. This is often reported in pandemics, such as the H1N1 outbreak of swine flu in 2009. The first confirmed death was recorded in Ukhana on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was registered in the Philippines on 1 February and outside Asia in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths, and several methods were usually used to quantify deaths.
All indicators vary according to region and time of disease spread; they are also affected by testing levels, the quality of health systems used by treatment schemes, the time of outbreaks of disease and population parameters, such as age, gender and overall health status; the mortality/ morbidity rate represents the number of deaths divided into the number of diagnosed cases of infection over a given period of time.
According to statistics from the University of Jones Hopkins, as at 10 April 2020 the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0 per cent (97,039/1 617 204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality rate to morbidity decreased from 17.3% (for those who experienced symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those who had symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods included the determination of the mortality rate as a result of disease (CFR) — the percentage of diagnosed patients who died from disease and the percentage of deaths from infection (IFR), which reflected the percentage of patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the figures of certain groups from the time of the infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.
According to the Oxford University Centre for Evidence Medicine, the total mortality rate from this pandemic ranges from 0.1 per cent to 0.39 per cent.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first random test at COVID-19 in Germany, as well as a statistical study analysing the impact of the testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and exact duration of the flash shall not be determined and may vary according to location.
Maciey Bonnie, a staff member of the University of Pennsylvania, claims that “uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to come onto the plateau, and then, when the number of available carriers ends, they begin to cease.
In the current situation, however, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will occur.”
The Senior Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, Zhong Nanjshan, claims that “it could all end by June” if all countries were able to mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-Cov-2 “will circulate perhaps within a year or two”.
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine is established (possibly 18 months or more)” it will be necessary to comply with physical distance measures and other measures.
William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University, says: “I don’t think this coronavirus will ever disappear at all, because it’s so easily transmitted”, and that it “can become a seasonal disease every year”.
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may carry the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88 per cent) and cough (68 per cent).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, wetness in the airways (slides), loss of breath, respiration, pain in the muscles and joints, sore throat, headache, chills, rheumatism, haemorrhagic, diarrhoea or cyanosis, WHO claims to be severe with the development of respiratory problems of about every six people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list urgent symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, permanent chest pain or feeling strangled, sudden sensation of confusion, difficulty waking up and bruising of a person or lips. If these symptoms are present, seek medical attention immediately. Further development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some infected people may experience unsymptomatic diseases without clinical evidence, but the results of the analysis confirm the infection, so doctors recommend that individuals in close contact with patients diagnosed with a diagnosis be placed under strict control and examined for infection.
Chinese scientists estimate that the number of cases with no symptoms of disease varies from several units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; it is usually five days; there is not yet complete clarity on the symptoms of loss of smell: the initial estimate for the percentage of patients with COVID-19 developing the symptom was 30 per cent and then fell to 15 per cent.
Some details on how to spread the disease are still unknown.
The disease is considered mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops released into the air together with cough, sneezing or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies in open cough, drops may extend from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet) in distance.
The virus can also be transmitted through small drops that are thrown into the air during a conversation that may remain in the air for longer periods of time. Respiratory drops may also occur in the outflow, including during conversation, although the virus is usually not transmitted through the air.
Drops can fall into the mouth or the nose of people around them, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiac and pulmonary resuscitation (SDR), may lead to the dispersion of the exhalation products and, therefore, to the spread of the virus in the air.
It may also penetrate the body if the person is concerned with the contaminated surface, including the skin, with a subsequent touch to his eyes, nose or lips.
There are also fears that the virus can be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese Government denies the possibility of a fecal oral transmission of SARS-COV-2. The virus is most infected within the first three days after symptoms have occurred, although its spread may occur both before symptoms have occurred and at later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where tests have been positive in testing three days prior to symptoms, and this indicates the possibility of transmission of the virus to the pronounced symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratory confirmed cases of unsymptomatic disease, but in some countries, communications monitoring studies have also identified cases of disease transmission from unsymptomatic carriers.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that it is not yet clear how easily the virus is spreading, but it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 others. The virus is able to survive on surfaces from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304) the virus could live for up to three days, on the cardboard surface for one day, and on the copper surface for up to four hours.
These data, however, vary depending on the humidity and temperature, with positive results from COVID-19 for domestic and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, just as they did after contacting other surfaces that infected people could touch.
Severe acute respiratory coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new virus that was first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Ukhane.
All signs of the new SARS-COV-2 virus are found in the nature of the native coronavirus. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed with a household soap that dissolves its protective shell. SARS-COV-2 is very similar to the original SARS-COV virus.
It's supposed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it is genetically classified with the genus Betacronavirus, the kind Sarbecovirus (cell line B) together with two other strains of flying mouse viruses.
At a holistic level, it is 96 per cent identical to other samples of batCov RatG13.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the sequences of the genome of pangoline and human viruses.
A full-geneous comparison to date showed that the largest percentage of similarity (92 per cent) was between pangoline and SARS-CoV-2 but that was not enough to prove that pangoline was intermediate masters of the virus.
The virus may be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although this should eventually be confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCB) analysis of the infected secret or computer tomography.
The results of the study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Ouhana showed that the CT was significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonias and disease-flows.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in the diagnosis of COVID-19”.
WHO published several RNA testing protocols on SARS-Cov-2, the first published on 17 January.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCA) testing is carried out.
It can be performed on respiratory samples and on blood samples.
The results are usually ready for several hours to several days.
The test usually uses a nosoglott brush, although it can also be used with a zane swab. A number of laboratories and companies develop serological tests to detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them were sufficiently accurate to obtain universal approval.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for use in emergency cases only by certified laboratories.
The characteristic features of visualization of symptoms in X-rays and computer tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral malignancy by type of matte glass and no pleural lesions.
The Italian Radiological Society is involved in the establishment of an international database of evidenced cases of infection.
Due to similarities with other infections, such as adenvirus, the identification of COVID-19 images not confirmed by PCR tests has limited clinical specificity.
China has conducted a major study comparing the results of the breast cell CT and the testing of PCRs, and it has been found that although the images are less specific in the event of an infection, they can be deciphered more quickly; they are also more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method can be seen as a screening tool in the infected areas.
In order to diagnose the virus using X-rays and CT scans, interlocking neural networks have been developed based on artificial intelligence.
Prevention strategies include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding eye, nose or lips with dirty hands, using coughing or smelling napkins that should be thrown out immediately after use.
Those who may already be infected should wear a medical mask in human places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended that people be physically separated from the population; many Governments recommend that any short-term travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak be avoided and that the movement of citizens be restricted.
Nevertheless, the virus has been able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading to the population, some of whom do not know where and how they were infected, and medical personnel who care for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, as well as precautions in contact with others and eye protection, and contact tracking is also an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of the infection and prevent its further spread.
The use of data on the whereabouts of citizens by their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty), as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements requiring the restriction of this kind of monitoring.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as at 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on solutions that ensure the confidentiality of personal data, such as recording user proximity to other mobile phones through Bluetooth technology.
If the mobile phone user was in close contact with the person whose test at COVID-19 was positive, he would be notified, and there are also groundless versions of how to prevent the infection — such as nose and lips, which are ineffective.
Currently, there are no vaccines from COVID-19, although many organizations are working on its creation.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends that the hands with soap and water be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or when the hands are severely contaminated, as well as before food, after snorting, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because when you are outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the soap that opens up its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends that hand sanitizers be used for alcohol treatment with a minimum of 60 per cent alcohol content.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or lips with dirty hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminated with a number of solutions (the stainless steel disinfectant begins to act a minute after administration) with 62 to 71 per cent ethanol, 50 to 100 per cent isopropanol, 0.1 per cent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 per cent hydrogen oxide oxide and 0.2 to 7.5 per cent iodine povidone.
Other components such as benzolconium chloride and gluconate chlorhexidine are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office or a day station, all such premises, including offices, toilets, general premises, electronic equipment, such as boards, sensor screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick persons, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that cough or sneeze cover the mouth and nose on the back of the elbow or napkin and immediately discard the used hygiene items.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, since the use of masks may limit the volume and range of exhaust products distributed in the air during conversation, sneeze and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, “the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, and touching their faces with dirty hands is the main way of infection.” Masks are also recommended for the use of those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of masks actually reduces the number of personal touch.
Several countries have begun to call for the use of medical masks in public places.
CDC centres, U.S.A., recommend wearing non-medical facial masks. China separately stressed the importance of using one-time medical masks for healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 m (3 m) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask in public transportation or in public places.
Thai health officials call on people to make facial tissue masks in their home environment and to wipe them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from going outside without masks closing their noses and mouths.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria obliged all visitors to the grocery stores to wear medical masks.
The Israeli Government has also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where ten million medical masks have been produced since mid-March, medical masks have been ordered for all passengers on trains and coaches.
In Panama, residents were required to wear a medical mask while going to the streets; those who could not acquire masks were advised to sew them themselves in their own household.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is a measure to combat infection, aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close human contact.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, school closures, jobs, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distance measures by staying at home, limiting their travel, avoiding people's places, using uncontacted greetings, and physically distanced from others.
Many regional Governments, particularly those affected by the outbreak, are now prescribing or recommending social distances.
The maximum number of people who can meet in one place according to the recommendation of the United States Government and health organizations has been rapidly reduced from 250 persons (in regions where no data have been provided on the dissemination of COVID-19) to 50 persons and later to 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned more than two groups, including older people and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system, from experiencing an increased risk of serious virus disease. CDC recommended that they stay at home as long as possible if there was an outbreak of disease in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began replacing the term “social distance” with “physical distance” by clarifying the objective of this measure, reducing physical contact in social relations, whether through virtual communication or with physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood in such a way that people should be completely excluded from social exclusion rather than in contact with other people by alternative means, some agencies published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, it has been recommended that you communicate only with your permanent partners and that you are confident that you do not have the virus and its symptoms.
People diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected to be infected were advised to self-insulation in their home environment.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on proper self-insulation, and many Governments have also imposed mandatory measures or recommended that the entire population of affected areas be quarantined on their own.
High-risk individuals were ordered to exercise stricter quarantine.
Persons who may have contacted the infected COVID-19 or have recently visited the country or region affected by the epidemic have been recommended to be quarantined within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Anti-flash strategies include control, suppression or mitigation of disease.
The disease is inhibited at an early stage and is intended to track and isolate the infected, as well as other infectious control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a stage where the spread of the disease is no longer manageable, efforts are focused on mitigating the effects: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on health and society.
Measures to control and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
The suppression of the infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline number of infections to below 1. Part of the control of the outbreak of the infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the leveling of the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overcrowding in health services and give more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help cope with outbreaks include measures of personal prevention, such as hand hygiene, the use of masks and self-insulation; public measures aimed at physical distances, such as school closures and the abolition of mass activities; community involvement in and participation in such measures; and environmental protection measures such as surface cleaning; once the severity of the outbreak has become apparent in China, more decisive action has been taken to contain the outbreaks, such as the isolation of entire cities and the introduction of strict travel bans.
Other countries have also adopted a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screenings and localized quarantines were introduced, as well as a system of warning of the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to self-insulated infected persons and fines largely for those who did not.
In Taiwan, medical mask production was increased and drug stockpiles were fined, and the British and US model showed that there were serious problems with mitigation (decelerated but not halting the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the growth of the epidemic).
The optimal policy of mitigating the effects of the spread of disease can reduce the peak health burden by 2/3, while mortality can double, but it can lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and a collapse of health systems.
The suppression may be the preferred method, but it should be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or until a vaccine is developed if it occurs earlier), as otherwise the spread of the disease will resume rapidly when the measures are reduced.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic results in social and economic costs.
Antivirals approved for treatment with COVID-19 do not currently exist, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking cold, plenty of fluid and rest can help relieve the symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection and respiratory support.
The use of steroids can only harm you.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also considered for treatment with COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and home remedies” could alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-COV-19.
WHO considers capacity-building and adaptation of health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a major response to outbreaks of disease.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO European Regional Bureau have issued guidelines for primary health care clinics and services to assist in the redistribution of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory testing services at COVID-19, the abolition of short-term procedures where possible, the detection of virus and the isolation of patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, as well as the enhancement of intensive therapy through training of personnel and the increase in the number of IVL and coca facilities available.
There are various theories about where the first case of infection might have arisen — the so-called “zero patient”.
The first known case of infection of a new coronary infection is likely to have occurred on 1 December 2019 in the town of Uhan Province of Hubay, China.
During the month, the number of cases of coronavirus infection in Hubei province gradually increased.
They were mainly linked to the Juanan offshore market, where live animals were also sold, and one theory was that the virus had penetrated the human body of one of these animals; in other words, the virus had a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a case of massive pneumonia of unknown origin was reported at the Jiang Tianjin Hospital on 27 December, reporting the case to the Jiangang Khan Disease Control and Prevention Centre in Uhan City.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at the Central Clinic of Ukhan warned their colleagues about “the SARS-like coronavirus”.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenyan, were warned by the police about the responsibility for the spread of false rumors, and the doctor, Ay Fen, received an excuse from her superiors for causing panic.
Later, on 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Ouhanya issued a public notification and informed WHO of the situation.
In early January, the number of cases of unknown pneumonia was reported by Ouhanya health authorities, which was large enough to initiate an investigation; at the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, which was facilitated by Chinese New Year's celebrations and by the fact that Ukhahn is a transport and main railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases of infection in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenchen.
By 20 January 2020, the symptoms of the disease had already occurred in 6,174 people, and by 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy for the largest number of confirmed cases worldwide.
Some 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one registered case of infection.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border control.
National responses included measures to curb the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory housekeeping, compulsory housekeeping or isolation), as well as curfews. As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population of the United States, were in some form of quarantine, more than 50 million persons were in isolation from the Philippines, about 59 million persons were in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion persons were in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later the figure increased to 2.6 billion people — about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Ukhana on 1 December 2019; according to another report, which was not verified, the date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Zhang Jisian's doctor worked on a case of mass pneumonia of unknown type, as announced on 27 December by the Centre for the Control and Prevention of Jianghan's Disease in Ukhahn.
The primary genetic testing of samples of patients on 27 December 2019 revealed the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Ouhanya Municipal Health Commission issued a public notification.
WHO was notified on the same day.
With regard to such notifications, the police warned doctors in Uhahn of the responsibility for the outbreak of rumors.
Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission argued that there was no “clear evidence” of the ability of the newly discovered virus to transmit from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, later referred to as the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China Si Jinping as “the People's War”.
The events of “the largest quarantine in the history of mankind” began on 23 January and the ban on entry into and back, with a total of 15 cities in the province of Hubay affected by a total of about 57 million people.
Personal transportation was banned in the city.
Celebrations on the occasion of the Chinese New Year (25 January) have been cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of the temporary Huoshang hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Later, another hospital, Laishan, was built, which received other incoming patients.
In addition to newly built hospitals, China also relocated 14 other institutions in Ukhana, such as conference centres and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government adopted additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including the issue of health certificates for travellers and the extension of the period of celebration of China ' s New Year.
Universities and schools were closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have implemented a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced remote modes of work.
Travel restrictions were imposed in and outside Hubay Province.
The timetable for public transport has been changed and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
Some 760 million people (more than half of the population) were estimated to have experienced some form of traffic restrictions in the open air, and after the outbreak entered the global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the import of the virus from other countries.
For example, in Beijing, a 14-day mandatory quarantine was introduced for all international travellers entering the city, and as of 23 March, only one case of intra-country transmission of the infection was registered in mainland China, which occurred five days earlier, in this case from a man who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Prime Minister Li Katzen of China reported that the spread of domestically transmitted diseases had been largely halted and the outbreak in China had been monitored.
On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubay, other than Ukhań, were lifted, two months after the closure of the province on quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that entry for persons with a visa or residence permit would be suspended.
Those wishing to come to China would have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on businesses and factories to resume their work and provided companies with a package of monetary incentives. On 4 April, a national three-minute silence was held at 10:00, which opened the day of mourning for victims of the coronavirus, announced by the National Council and coincided with the festival of Quinmin, but the central Government requested citizens to pay tribute to the deceased online, while respecting their physical distance to avoid the resurgence of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in confirmed cases due to the large number of followers of the new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus Shinchhongji, gathered in Tegu.
Shinchongji’s followers came to Tegu from Ukhań, which is supposed to be the source of the outbreak.
As at 22 February, out of 9,336 churchgoers, 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported symptoms of the disease. On 23 February 2020, the highest level of concern was announced in South Korea.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were recorded in Korea, and as early as 29 February, this figure had risen to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers had been tested to confirm the virus.
The flash had affected the number of trips, and therefore the timetable for airlines had been changed. South Korea had launched a programme to screen the population for the presence of a virus, to track contacts and to organize quarantine measures for contact persons, which was considered to be the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.
The screening methods included mandatory information on their symptoms through mobile applications by all those who came from abroad, a head test for the virus that was ready for the next day, and an increase in testing capabilities that allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
The South Korean programme is considered successful in combating the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that it did not isolate entire cities, and the South Korean society was initially divided by President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called for Mr. Moon ' s impression that the Government ' s response to the outbreak was inadequate.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had registered the lowest total number of cases of infection in one day for four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, as of 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad would be placed on a two-week quarantine facility.
According to media reports, on 1 April, South Korea sought assistance in testing 121 countries for the virus.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-COV-2 infection in Kum, where, according to data from the Ministry of Health and Health Education, two people died later that day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the abolition of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, universities and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Ruhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government does not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals will be quarantined.
Plans to limit cross-urban travel were announced in March, but the intensive movement of cities prior to the Persian New Year continued.
The Shiite shrines in Kum remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020, and Iran became the centre of the post-China virus in February.
Against the backdrop of allegations of concealment in Iran, by 28 February more than 10 countries had linked cases of disease to Iran, indicating that the magnitude of outbreaks there could be more serious than 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government by that date.
Iran's Parliament was closed and 23 of its 290 members reported positive on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peaceful ill-thinking and to temporarily release all prisoners eligible for this category.
The Organization states that there is an increased risk of virus spread in closed institutions, such as prisons, where adequate medical care is lacking.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day — the largest number of deaths registered in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 active or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of this disease.
By 23 March, 50 new cases of coronary disease were recorded every hour in Iran and one new death every 10 minutes from the coronavirus.
According to the WHO representative, the incidence in Iran may be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
The US sanctions against Iran are also expected to affect the country ' s financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights demanded that economic sanctions be mitigated against countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease hit the territory of Italy, when two Chinese tourists tested SARS-COV-2 in Rome had a positive effect.
The number of cases of infection has grown rapidly, prompting the Italian Government to suspend all flights to China and China and declare an emergency.
A non-sociated cluster of COVID-19 infections was later discovered. It began with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree to contain the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 persons from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were quarantined.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "The entrance and exit of the area will be blocked.
On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, since 100 people had already been killed in Italy.
All major sports events, including series A soccer matches, were to be held behind closed doors before April, but on 9 March all sports events were postponed for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the closure of almost all commercial activities and the closure of enterprises except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Anesthesia, Reanimation and Intensive Therapy (SIAARTI) issued recommendations on medical ethics regarding emergency protocols for patients who may need to be used.
On 19 March, Italy promoted China to the level of death from the coronavirus, taking first place in the world after the announcement of 3,405 deaths.
On 22 March, it became known that Russia had dispatched nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases of coronary infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases of recovery in Italy, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardia region.
One CNN report notes that such high mortality rates in Italy can be facilitated by a combination of two factors — a large number of elderly citizens in that country and the lack of the ability to examine all who are currently more likely to have a coronavirus.
The United Kingdom responded most calmly to the virus from all affected countries, and by 18 March 2020 the British Government had not obliged citizens to observe any form of social distance or quarantine.
As a result, the Government was criticized for its lack of rapid and serious response to the danger faced by the country ' s population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement recommending that it refrain from all travel and social contacts of no priority, inviting people to work from their homes and avoid public places, such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment institutions, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible and promised working citizens to pay up to 80 per cent of their salaries, but not more than £2,500 per month as a support measure for the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent social distance measures, banning more than two people from gathering and restricting travel and active recreation in the fresh air only to cases of extreme necessity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions have been imposed by the police, fines and massacres.
Most enterprises were ordered to be shut down, except for enterprises that provided “living life” for the population, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, business stores, car stations and garages.

On 28 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, led by the United States Government in the field of public health, announced that it had developed its own testing kit.
Despite this, the testing of the population in the United States did not begin immediately, and as a result, the real magnitude of the outbreak was hidden during that period.
The testing was hampered by the marriage of test kits issued by the Federal Government in February, the absence by the end of February of a Federal Government permit to use non-State test kits developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, as well as restrictive criteria prior to the beginning of March to enable citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done by the appointment of a physician).
The Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests were conducted in the United States by 27 February.
The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests were conducted by 13 March.
On 22 March, Associated Press reported: “Many patients, even with symptoms and appointment of a doctor, were waiting for their schedule for hours or days of analysis.” After a report was received from Washington State on 29 February about the first case of death of a coronavirus in the United States, Governor Jay Insley announced a state of emergency, which was also announced shortly by other states.
On 3 March, schools in Seattle were cancelled and schools closed throughout the country by mid-March. On 6 March 2020, an Imperial College epidemiologists group, London, informed the United States about forecasts of the impact of the new coronavirus on the country.

By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and in the district of Colombia. On 23 March, 10,700 cases of infection were reported in New York City, exceeding the total number of cases in South Korea.
On 25 March, the Governor said that social distances were likely to be an effective measure, as the estimates of doubling the number of cases decreased from 2.0 to 4.7 days.
As of 28 March, 32,308 cases of disease were reported in New York City and 672 persons died; on 26 March, more confirmed cases of coronary infection were reported in the United States than in any other country of the world, including China and Italy.

On 3 April, the United States recorded 884 deaths from the coronavirus for 24 hours.
In New York State, the number of cases exceeded 100,000 on 3 April, and the White House has been criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring information that comes into open access by controlling through the Vice-President Mike Penz's office public statements and publications of officials and health professionals associated with the virus.
Overall, President Trump ' s views on how successful he was in dealing with the crisis were divided.
Some officials and observers criticized the US ' s dependence on import of essential materials, including essential items, from China.
In mid-January 2020, an analysis of air travel patterns was published in Travel Medicine, which was used to map and predict disease patterns.
On the basis of information from the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei adopted the largest number of passengers from Ukhań.
Dubai, Sydney, and Melbourne were also popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist routes, Bali was called the least prepared for outbreaks, while Australian cities were considered the most prepared. On 7 February, Australia adopted its emergency plan for the new coronavirus (CAVID-19).
In this regard, it is stated that much remains to be learned of COVID-19 and that Australia will pay particular attention to border controls and communications in the threat situation.
An emergency situation in the area of human biosafety was announced in Australia on 21 March.

Businessman Jack Ma went to the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 1.1 million testing kits, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective suits to be distributed by the organization through its participating States.
He later also sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 medical masks and 5 IVLs to Panama.
The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed concern about medical masks and kits for testing Chinese production.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 Chinese test kits for a crownavirus of up to 30 per cent accuracy, while the Netherlands withdrew 600,000 missing Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also withdrew 100,000 unsuited masks: they were supposed to have been made in China but subsequently emerged from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese assistance was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched relief operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of the infection.
WHO noted the apparent differences between the outbreak of atypical pneumonia in 2002-2004, during which the Chinese authorities were charged with withholding information that allegedly prevented disease prevention and containment, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central Government “regularly provided updated information on the situation in order to avoid panic prior to the Chinese New Year”.
On 23 January, in response to a decision by the central authorities to impose a ban on the movement of transport to Uhana, the representative of WHO, Goden Galea, noted that although “this measure was definitely recommended not by WHO”, it was also “a very important confirmation of the implementation of the obligation to contain the epidemic at the most widespread sites”, and called it “an unprecedented public health emergency”. On 30 January, after the possibility of transmission from a person to a person outside China and an increase in the number of infected in other countries was confirmed, WHO declared an emergency situation in the public health system of international importance (PHEIC), the situation had become the sixth since 2009, when such a measure was first applied during the swine flu pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adano, stated that the PHEIC announcement was a result of “the risk of global proliferation, especially in low- and middle-income countries with poor health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros stated that “there is no reason for measures that unduly impede international movements and trade”, and that “WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to provide $675 million to ensure strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting on the need to provide urgent assistance to those countries “who do not have systems to identify people infected by the virus, although the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our readiness is the degree of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest”, and called upon the international community to “make a choice: invest today or pay in the future”. At a press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres agreed to provide “the potential of the entire UN system to respond to the problem”.
As a result, the UN Crisis Management Unit has been set up to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, according to WHO, will “focus on health response while other agencies can use their expertise to combat the outbreak in a broader social and economic context”.
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated a joint ad hoc group, which provided the work of international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in resolving the situation within the country and assessing the “seriousness and contagion of the disease”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of responses at the provincial and district levels, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that “it is too early to call this pandemic disease, but that countries must nevertheless be ready to do so”.
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the likelihood of global proliferation of the coronavirus would be increased from “high” to “very high” — the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, the Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in his statement: “This is the verification of every government on the planet for a realistic situation: it is time to act.
This virus may already be on its way to your country, and you need to be ready," and stressed that proper responses can help the world avoid the “worst scenario of events”.
Ryan also stated that current data did not serve as a basis for declaring the global pandemic as public health officials, and added that the pandemic announcement would mean that “we essentially recognize that everyone on the planet will be at risk of being infected with the virus”.
On 11 March, WHO announced a pandemic outbreak.
WHO's Director-General stated that WHO “is deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction in this regard”. WHO is being seriously criticized for considering an inadequate approach to the concept of a pandemic, including later public health emergencies and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
As a response to the current situation, Mr. Tedros Adanom, Director-General of WHO, was petitioned with a proposal to resign, which was signed by 733,000 persons as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respect for the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone had the right to life-saving measures against him and that the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should not in any way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
Experts stressed that everyone has the right to health protection, including those with disabilities, minority groups, older citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of State support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as information on views and recommendations.
The Digital Unit contains information on the policy measures of different countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the world economy, address quarantine and travel restrictions in order to help countries learn from one another and promote coordinated global responses to the fight against coronavirus.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Goov and Eduardo Bolsonar, son of Brazil President Jair Bolsonar, for the actions taken to combat the pandemic that began with the Chinese province of Hubay.
A number of heads of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) were dismissed for the quarantine measures they had taken in central China, and these dismissals showed dissatisfaction with the political extermination in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, Si Jinping, from public anger over the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lizian, disagreed with the earlier statement that the outbreak of the coronavirus started in Ukhana but took the side of the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. President Donald Trump's administration called the Chinese virus or the Ukhanja virus, saying that “censorship in China only exacerbates the situation of the virus that has now become a global pandemic”, and this statement has in turn been criticized by some commentators who claim that such an approach is racist and “distracts from the inability of the U.S. President's administration to prevent the spread of disease”.
The Daily Beast has gained access to the U.S. Government telegram, which contains the communication strategy that the National Security Council seems to have invented, with the following references to the strategy: “It is all about China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television presentations.” Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to assist countries affected by the virus are part of the “advocacy effort” to achieve global influence.
The head of EU foreign policy, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of a “geopolitical component that includes the struggle for influence through piracy and so-called generosity policy”.
Borrell also stated that “China is persistently promoting its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States”.
China also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some information sending assistance to the last two countries.
The donation of Jack Ma 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned in connection with US sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The US authorities are also accused of transferring aid to their own country for other countries.
There were also disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy, regarding medical masks.
In addition, Turkey has allocated hundreds of IVLs to Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticised the lack of support from the European Union for Italy's coronavirus.
Mauricio Massari, Italian Ambassador to the EU, said that “China alone has reacted bilaterally.
This clearly does not indicate European solidarity.”
On 22 March, following a telephone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized a mission to Italy of Russian military paramedics, specialized disinfection transport and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “high-level political source”, claiming that 80 per cent of Russian aid was “useless or of little value to Italy”.
The source accused Russia of seeking a favourable impression on the world public at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
President Lombardi Attilio Fontana and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy Luigi Di Mayo rejected the media attacks and expressed appreciation for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
Press Secretary of the Kremlin Dmitry Peskov stated that “in offering assistance to American colleagues [Putin] suggests that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase their production, they will also be able to provide response if necessary”.
NATO’s “Protector-2020” military exercises, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries — the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the cold war — will be conducted in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, has criticized the Defender 2020 (Protector-2020) exercises: “In the crisis situation in public health today, the conduct of these exercises threatens not only the lives of the US military and many European participating countries but also the inhabitants of the countries where such activities are to be carried out.” The Iranian Government has suffered greatly from the virus, and about two dozen members of Parliament have been infected, as well as fifteen other current or former political figures.
On 14 March 2020, President Hassan Ruhani, in an open letter, asked world leaders for assistance, saying that his country was having difficulty in combating the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets for sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic issued calls for the United States to adopt social policies that were prevalent in other active countries, including the introduction of a single health system and care system for children paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Politologists expected that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential elections, as a result of the pandemic, diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated.
South Korea has criticised Japan's “sensuous and passive quarantine measures” after Japan has announced that any citizen from South Korea will be placed on a two-week quarantine facility in Government-appointed places.
South Korean society initially split up because of President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impugned for an inadequate response by the Government to the outbreak of the disease; the pandemic forced countries to adopt emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this step would enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of allowing Prime Minister Victor Orban to manage indefinitely through decrees, suspend Parliament ' s work, and hold elections and punish those accused of spreading fairy tale information about the virus and governmental measures to combat the crisis.
The outbreak of the coronavirus was identified as the cause of several shortages of supplies owing to the global increase in the use of epidemic equipment, the accumulation of panic goods and the disruption of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Office for Food and Drug Quality Control issued a warning of a shortage of medicines and medical equipment, resulting from increased consumer demand and malfunctions in the work of suppliers.
There were also panic buyings in several settlements; this led to the loss of essential goods, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, which in turn led to shortages of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry warns about delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, the demand for personal protection has increased by 100 times.
This jump resulted in a twenty-fold increase in prices compared to the usual price, as well as delays in the supply of medical supplies for four to six months.
It also created a lack of personal protection worldwide, and WHO warned that health workers would be hit for that reason.
In Australia, due to the daigo pandemic, buyers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This has led to a lack of food in some supermarkets and has subsequently been banned by the Australian Government, despite the high incidence of COVID-19 in Northern Italy and the Ukhan region, as well as the high demand for food, a sharp food shortage has been avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and illicit trade in critical products have been successful in avoiding the acute food shortages expected in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant declines, but is of the opinion that agricultural prices may increase.
The Poles of food shops remained empty only temporarily, even in the town of Ouhan, while Chinese government officials ensured access to pig stocks in order to provide full food for the population.
Similar laws requiring food producers to preserve food stocks in case of emergency exist in Italy.
The impact of the world economy had on China: according to the media of 16 March, China's economy had suffered greatly in the first two months of 2020 due to measures to combat the spread of the virus by the Government, which had reduced retail sales by 20.5 per cent.
The mother China is a major economic and production centre; therefore, it is considered that a viral outbreak poses a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agate Demaraj, an Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that market volatility will continue until there is a clearer picture of potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current global growth epidemic could outweigh the impact of the 2002-2004 atypical pneumonia epidemic.
According to one of the estimates made by an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis, the damage to the world supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could take up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has taken urgent action after a sharp decline in oil prices due to a drop in demand from China.
On 24 February, the world stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected by COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to growing fears about the outbreak of the coronavirus, various US fund indices, including NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and the Dou-Jones index for industrial companies, showed the most dramatic decline since 2008, with the Dou index falling to 1191 points, the largest one-day drop since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than a 10 per cent drop.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a negative forecast.
Stocks fell again because of fears about the spread of the coronavirus, and the biggest decline took place on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a likelihood of an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed Al-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks react faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in connection with travel bans, closures of public places, including tourist sights, and the recommendations of Governments not to travel.
As a result of all these measures, many airlines cancelled flights due to a sharp decline in air traffic demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and British Flybe regional airline ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has proved to be more powerful than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-jun, the main tourist season of China's New Year's celebrations.
A number of events involving a large number of people have been cancelled by national and regional Governments, including the annual New Year festivals; private companies have also closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year's events have been cancelled, and tourist sights have been closed to prevent mass excavations; for example, in Beijing, the Forbidden City was closed and traditional temple fairs canceled.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the november holidays until 10 February, instructing most enterprises not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong authorities raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and announced an emergency situation by closing schools until March and cancelling New Year ' s celebration. The retail sector was affected globally: store hours were reduced and some shops were temporarily closed.
Visit to retail trade in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40 per cent.
Retail companies in North America and the Middle East have reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, the attendance of the shopping centres fell by 33 to 43 per cent in March, compared with February.
Trade Point operators around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitation, the installation of visitors ' temperature testing and the lifting of activities, and according to the assessment of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic can leave 14 to 22 million more people behind poverty than it would have been in a similar situation, but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, about 5 million people lost their jobs in the outbreak of the Ouhan epidemic in China.
Many of China ' s 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves at home in the provinces of their country or locked up in Hubei Province, with more than 10 million Americans losing their jobs in March 2020 and seeking the assistance of the Government.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, the outbreak of the coronavirus could deprive 47 million people of their jobs and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent. The self-insulation measures imposed in India would leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers without work, and a study conducted by the Angus Reid Institute showed that 44 per cent of Canadian households faced unemployment in one way or another. Nearly 900,000 Spanish workers also lost jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers filed applications for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit. Almost half a million German companies transferred their employees to a government-submitted reduced work schedule, a part-time job.
The German part-time pay scheme was also introduced in France and Britain.
Art and cultural heritage were also severely affected by a pandemic that affected organizations, as well as individuals, whether officially established or independent, worldwide.
Cultural and artistic organizations have tried to support their (often financed by the State) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, as well as, if possible, supporting people of art.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed for an indefinite period of time, or access to them had been limited and exhibitions, events and presentations had been cancelled or moved to other dates.
In return, strong efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, another recent and emerging traffic resulting from the spread of the virus — the abolition of religious services, major sporting activities and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced the abolition of the Passion Week in Rome during the last week of the Christian repentant period, the Great Position.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend Sunday services; in some churches, church services have begun broadcasting on radio, live or on television, while some church leaders have offered to conduct outdoor services.
Rome's Roman Catholic diocese closed to visit its church, hourly and St. Peter's Square, where Christian pilgrims had not yet appeared, and later other religious organizations had also abolished worship and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gourds.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the lifting of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of the coronavirus, and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned the access of foreign pilgrims and its own inhabitants to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sports events since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or moved, including the UEFA 2019-20 Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the Euro-2020 UEFA, the season NBA 2019-20 and the season NHL 2019-20.
The outbreak of the coronavirus also destroyed plans for the summer of the 2020 Olympic Games to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be “moved beyond 2020, but no later than 2021”. Casinos and other gaming institutions around the world were closed and poker tournaments that are usually broadcast live were also transferred or cancelled.
This has led many players to move online, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers, as the entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theatres, such as Broadway, have also canceled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline merropia, some artists and musicians have begun to study options for continuing their activities and sharing their results on the Internet, direct web concerts or festivals; this helps people to continue performing, publishing or publishing their works.
There are a number of Internet memes on the topic of the coronavirus, many of which are humorous and smooth with the alarming sentiments of times of uncertainty.
Since the emergence of COVID-19, there has been an increase in bias, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese citizens and people of Eastern Asian descent, as well as to representatives of the population of the hotspots of Europe, the United States and other countries.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
The February news reports (where most cases of infection were still limited by China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received just retribution for anything.
Anti-Chinese sentiments have also increased in some countries in Africa.
Many residents of Ukhań and Hubey reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
The citizens of China, as well as its inhabitants living in the virus-affected areas, were supported both in the offline and online regime.
The epidemic began to spread in new countries, particularly Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19; hence, citizens of such regions could also begin to feel the influence of suspicion and xenophobia; citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed a petition early in their efforts to prevent Chinese citizens from entering their countries to contain the epidemic.
In Japan hashtag # ChineseDontCome To Japan (#ChinaDon't comeJappa) held leading positions on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report a growing level of racist sentiment and even assault.
US President Donald Trump faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a “Chinese virus”; critics view it as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protestors attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Ukhań to New Sanjar.
Students coming from North-East India bordering China and studying in India ' s major cities reported cases of persecution related to the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, President of the State Department of Bharatiya Janata, West Bengal, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and “God has avenged them by poet. ”
Later, these statements were condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, which called them “misleading”. In China, xenophobia and racism erupted again against non-Chinese nationals: aliens were called “foreign debris” and objects to be “killed”.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made available their scientific articles on the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to their research on publishing servers such as bioRxiv.
Infectious disease — Infectious disease of the returning pathogen, the spread range or mode of transmission of which is often unknown
Globalization and disease — Review of globalization and the spread of disease
List of epidemics and pandemics — List of deaths from infectious diseases
The smuggling of wild animals and animal diseases is a health risk associated with trade in exotic animals.
Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-COV-2 virus include methods for detecting the presence of the virus and methods for detecting antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by the OPCW, which recognises the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and intended only for detection of SARS-COV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
Detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population control.
Antibody analyses indicate the number of people suffering from the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to treat or absent from the hospital.
The exact mortality rate of this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, there were no reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population due to limited testing capacity in any country.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests conducted in different countries was highly contradictory.
These differences in information are likely to have a significant impact on registered mortality rates, which in some countries may be significantly exaggerated.
A real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test can be performed on samples from airways obtained in different ways, including nosoglott or wet swabs.
The results are usually available for several hours to 2 days.
The PCR test, carried out on brushes taken from the throat, is valid only during the first week of the disease.
The virus can disappear from its throat later, but still multiply in the lungs.
In infected patients tested for a second week of disease, lower respiratory tract material may be taken as an alternative, or food may be used for digestion (wet).
One of the early PCR tests was developed at Sharite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and a base of 250,000 kits that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, a South Korean company, Kogenebiotech, had developed a set to detect SARS-CoV-2 based on PCR clinical level (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It identifies the gene “E”, common to all beta coronaviruses, and the gene RdRp, specific to SARS-COV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group has become one of the first companies to be approved by the National Drug Administration of China for the immediate use of the SARS-COV-2 detection kit based on PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have distributed their diagnostic tool for real-time RT-PCR (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCOV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) to public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests in the older versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to the lack of reagents and the narrow test area carried out by CDC in Atlanta; an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date State and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The testing was approved by the Office for Food and Medicinal Products Quality Oversight as part of an emergency application permit. The US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced that it was possible to test for COVID-19 based on RT PCR throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics began COVID-19 testing throughout the country since 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been declared; the collection and processing of analyses must be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, a test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology, "VECTOR".
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Oversight Service, and it was reported that on 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect the infection of COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA for the use of a test that could be carried out for 3.5 hours on a large sample basis, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted emergency authorisation to Abbott laboratories for testing Abbott m2000; previously, the FDA granted a similar permit to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020 Cepheid also receives an EUA from the FDA for a test of about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test in which the technology for the amplification of isothemic nucleic acids was used instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of decreasing temperatures, it can detect positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
At present, there are about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests a day.
A review of specialized literature in March 2020 concluded that “the chest x-rays have little diagnostic value at the early stages, whereas the results of the CT [computer CT] may be of such value even before symptoms occur”.
Typical signs identified by the CT include bilateral multi-lower subpleural sealing functions by type of matte glass with peripheral, asymmetric and aesthetic distribution.
Subpleural domination, mulle bridge symptom and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
The results of the study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Ouhana at the time of the current pandemic showed that the CT is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in the diagnosis of COVID-19”. As of March 2020, the CDC initial screening recommends that the PCR method be used.
In part, the immune response to the infection is expressed in the formulation of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after the 7th day of the day, to determine immunity and to carry out population control. Analysis can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by diagnosis on the ground (POCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to run high-production automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
A sample of peripheral blood is usually used in CLT, although serial samples may also be used to trace the immune response.
In PoCT, one sample of blood is usually obtained by piercing each cover.
Unlike PCR methods, the blood collection phase is not required for sampling. On 26 March 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have undergone all the necessary registration procedures and are now able to pass their antibody tests.
As at 7 April 2020, only one emergency release test was approved by the FDA. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were granted European authorisations for the use of their test kits that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples capable of combating the virus.
The productivity of the test is several hundred samples over several hours, and therefore this method works much faster than normal PCA analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodys can usually be detected 14 days after the infection. In early April, Britain discovered that none of its antibody analysis kits provided satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme was developed to allow patients with suspected virus to stay at home: “the emergency care department personnel pass the patient a sample for the sample”, the patient spits in it, gives it back, and after a while receives the test results. British NHS announced its pilot scheme for testing suspicious cases in the home environment, which eliminates the risk of infection by other clinics, or the need to disinfect the ambulance if it was used to transport the patient. During the test of COVID-19, in suspicious cases, the medical worker takes an analysis using all appropriate precautions.
The Express Testing Centres helped South Korea run one of the fastest and largest testing procedures in another country. On 2 March, in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Doctors stated that it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests per day under outpatient conditions and weeks earlier only 10,700 tests per week.
If the examination is appointed by a doctor, the costs shall be covered by medical insurance.
According to the President of the Robert Koh Institute, Germany’s total productivity for testing is 160,000 tests per week.
As at 19 March, it was proposed that several major cities be tested.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that, as of calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 analyses were carried out on SARS-CoV-2, up to Week 12/2020, including 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent) positive results. Israeli clinics Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and carrying out further analyses only if the combined sample showed positive results. In Ouhana, on 5 February 2020, a temporary laboratory of 2,000 square metres for the detection of emergencies, called Huo-Yan (Chinese) was opened by BGI, which could handle more than 10,000 samples per day.
The construction of this laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Van Jiang and completed in only 5 days; the modelling showed that if the laboratory had not been put into service at such an accelerated rate, the incidence of Hube disease would have been 47 per cent higher and the quarantine costs, respectively, would have been twice higher.
The laboratories Huo-Yan in Shenchen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai were immediately opened up to a total of 12 cities in China.
By 4 March 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day, with open multi-formed Origami Assays schematics, which can test up to 1,222 patients on COVID19 using only 93 samples, such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, excluding the need to use robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, due to the lack and insufficient response rates, mass testing in the EU, Britain and the United States had become problematic.
As a result, some authors have applied test samples for 5 minutes for the release of RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the amount of test for the coronavirus currently carried out by the United Arab Emirates per capita was higher than any other country and that most of the population would soon be protested.
This was due to the ability to carry out the express test, together with the acquisition by the Group of 42 and BGI of a mass-testing laboratory (created on the basis of their laboratories to detect the emergency of Huo-Yan in China).
The laboratory, which was launched in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the world's first laboratory of such a large scale that is operating outside China.
Various testing options for different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of manufacturing test kits to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Sanitation and Epidemiology Centres was not available until 28 January, resulting in a lack of testing kits in the United States. At the very beginning of the outbreak in China and the United States, there were problems with the reliability of the test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide a sufficient number of kits recommended by health experts.
According to experts in South Korea, the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has been working to provide testing facilities, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increased development of testing programmes as the best way to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increasing demand for testing caused by the rapid spread of the virus, many U.S. private laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of samples of analyses, were overburdened and supplies of material for removal of strokes and chemical reagents were rapidly depleted.
China reported problems with accuracy in its test kits in March 2020.
The American test kits developed by CDC had “disadvantages”, and for this reason the Government removed bureaucratic barriers that hindered private testing. Spain obtained test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of the kits were inaccurate.
The company explained that the lack of accuracy of the results could result in poor sampling or incorrect use of the kits.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw the sets of incorrect results and replace them with other sets, such as Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80 per cent of the test kits that the Czech Republic acquired in China had failed. 1.2 million testing kits purchased by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic proposed to drop them in the Danube. Atesh Kara, a member of the Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that test kits purchased in China had “high error rates” and the Ministry “did not use them”. The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it announced that these kits were not suitable for use.
Quarantine measures for persons whose analyses have had a positive impact on SARS-COV-2, as well as monitoring of the people contacted by such patients have had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where for the first time in Italy a COVID-19 died, conducted two cycles of testing of an entire population of about 3,400 people, with a interval of approximately ten days.
About half of the people with positive outcomes had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were quarantined.
The entry into the territory of the populated area was closed, and this measure completely halted the spread of the infection.
In the context of intensive contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronary pandemic in Singapore was much less strained than in other developed countries, and there was no need to impose such extreme restrictions as forced closures of restaurants and shops.
Many activities were cancelled there, and on 28 March Singapore began urging residents to stay at home, but schools in which the holidays ended on 23 March were open on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also dealt with the pandemic through intensive monitoring of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions have been less aggressive.
The statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were carried out than the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because more patients with weak symptoms or no symptoms were identified by these countries.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative results of the COVID-19 analyses to one of the 16 WHO control laboratories for confirmatory testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
On the next schedule, the indicators of the "positive results" column depend on the country-specific testing policy.
The country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive percentage than the country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of the virus, under other equal conditions.
Washing hands, also known as hand hygiene, is a process of cleansing hands to remove pollution, fat, micro-organisms or other harmful substances.
Regular washing of hands with soap at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are passed on fecalally.
Humans may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or common colds, for example, if they touch the eyes, nose or lips (i.e. mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day, after which the hands should be washed with soap: before and after defecation, after washing a child's berries or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before food, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If the water and soap are not available, the hands can be cleaned by means of evil.
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or washing the toilet child.
After snorting, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
The health care of the hands refers to the hygiene of medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking medicines or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteries, viruses or other micro-organisms that can cause disease), as well as chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who cook or work in the medical field, but it is also important for all other people.
Washing hands is very good for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious diarrhoea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
and reduces infant mortality in households.
The 2013 study showed that better hand washing could lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders of the benefits of hand washing can reduce diarrhoea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of low-income regions of clean water.
The reduction in diarrhoea by 48 per cent may be associated with washing hands with soap, washing hands with soap is the only most effective and affordable way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory diseases (PRIs), provided that appropriate habits are developed in each home, in schools and in other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of the ORI, is the primary cause of under-five deaths, which kills about 1.8 million children a year.
In general, nearly 3.5 million children die of diarrhoea and pneumonia annually.
The United Nations Children's Fund reports that washing hands with soap before and after the toilet, which has become a strong habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths from diarrhoea by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
The washing of hands is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out under the water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Washing hands also prevents the emergence of impetitis, a disease that is transmitted in direct physical contact.
The minor adverse effect of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to drying and, investigatively, damage to the skin.
A 2012 Danish study showed that excessive washing of hands could lead to the swelling of the skin, a disease known as eczema or dermatitis, which is particularly common to health workers.
Too often, hand washing may also be considered a symptom of obsessive and compulsive disorder (CD).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal oral transmission: after emptying (wet discharge, defecation), after washing a child’s berries (slip change), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases where hands should be washed to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after the treatment of the cut or wound, after the smelling, coughing or snorting, after touching the waste of the animal or animal, after touching the debris.
In many countries, the washing of hands with soap is relatively low.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 showed that, on average, 38.7% of families wash their hands with soap is a common practice. The 2014 study showed that the highest score, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the United States is closer to the middle of the list, 77%; the lowest was recorded in China, 23%. At present, there are several methods of behavioural change and practice in washing their hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group washing of hands in schoolchildren at a specified time of the day is one of such methodologies that helps train children into such a procedure.
The Emergency Health Programme, implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of large-scale child health and education activities.
The national programme is based on dehelmintization, which takes place twice a year, as well as daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluorine.
The same programme is being successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from each cover is more effective when soap or washing agents are added.
The main activity of soap and cleaning products is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water is not in itself an effective means of skin cleansing, since fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollutants, are poorly dissolved in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the cleansing process.
Hard soap, due to repeated use, may also contain bacteria that may fall on it in previous use.
A small number of studies on each cover of bacteria from contaminated solid soap indicate that it is unlikely to be caught, as bacteria are washed with foam.
The CDC still claims that “any soap with a hand dispenser is the preferred way to wash hands”.
Antibacterial soap is actively promoted in health communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, the antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if strains resistant to antibiotics are not selective in relation to antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may be inconsistent with the advertised one.
In addition to surface-active substances and skin protection products, complex compounds may contain acids (excessive, ascorbic, milky) as pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other vents (alle faith, vitamins, menthol, extracts of plants). A comprehensive analysis by the School of Public Health of the University of Oregon has shown that, in order to prevent diseases and remove bacteria from the skin, simple soap varieties are as effective as the usual antibacterial soap containing triclosan.
Hot water that is comfortable for the human skin is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature of 37°C.
However, to remove natural fats that contain pollution and bacteria, heat soap water is more effective than cold water.
Contrary to popular opinion, research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a water-free hygiene tool.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the use of alcohol-free water-free drugs (also known as alcohol disinfectants, antiseptic hand disinfectants or sanitizers) became popular.
Most of these products are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners, such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of gel, or moisturizers such as glycerine in liquid or foam, which provide comfort in the use of these products and reduces the effect of drying of the skin by alcohol.
The addition of diluent hydrogen oxide further increases antimicrobial activity and disinfectants containing a minimum of 60 to 95 per cent alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multiple drug-sustainable bacteria (MRSA and VRE), the tuberculosis stick, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
70 per cent of alcohol disinfectants kill 99.97 per cent of bacteria (reductionlog of 3.5 as a 35 decibel reduction) on their hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99 per cent 99.999 per cent of bacteria (reduction of 4-5) on their hands one minute after use.
Alcohol disinfectants are practically ineffective against norviral (or Norwalk)-type viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. A sufficient amount of antiseptic or spirit content should be used to carefully process and nourish the skin of the hands on both sides.
The face and rear surface of both loins, as well as the space between the fingers, shall be wiped out throughout the length for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully in use.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that handwashing be chosen rather than using disinfectants, especially if the hands are heavily contaminated.
The increasing popularity of such disinfectants is due to the ease of their use and the rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be a substitute for a full washing of hands if water and soap are available.
The frequent use of hand sanitizers on an alcoholic basis may cause dry skin if it does not contain moisturizers and/or moisturizers of the skin.
The effect of drying of the skin by alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other mitigating substances to the substance.
In clinical trials, alcohol disinfectants containing mitigating components caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than soap or antimicrobials.
Allergy contact dermatitis, contact dot syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are practically non-existent.
The less likely occurrence of irritable contact dermatitis has been a factor in the choice of disinfectants over soap and water.
In spite of its effectiveness, the means that do not contain water do not cleanse hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens as conventional soap and water, since they still leave pathogens in their hands.
The effectiveness of the disinfectant for non-spiral hands is largely dependent on components and composition and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or spirit containing agents.
It has recently been shown that preparations using benzolconium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to be loss of effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive side effects.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with evil or clay.
Gold or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or gold are contaminated by microorganisms, it can, on the contrary, increase the spread of disease.
As soap, it is a disinfectant, since it forms a bloated solution in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends use of gold or sand as an alternative.
In order to prevent contamination, the U.S. Disease Control Centres recommend the use of hand washing techniques, including the following steps:
Relax your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is recommended that the running water be contaminated because the temperature of the water does not matter.
Wash your hands by wiping them with a large amount of soap, including the back of your elbows, as well as the area between your fingers and under your fingernails.
The soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap (and not just one water).
Three hands at least 20 seconds.
Trening helps to remove germs from the skin, and the longer you hold your hands, the more germs are removed.
Carefully loosen your hands under running water.
The stripping of hands in standing water can cause a re-infection.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry off on their own.
Wet and wet hands are more easily polluted, and most often people leave areas such as thumb, wrist, fingertips and fingertips unattended.
The artificial fingernails and fingernail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended that wet lotion be used to prevent drying of the hands that may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash your hands: spilling water out of a hanging canister or bottled pumpkin with holes made and/or using evil, if necessary, such as in developing countries. In areas with limited water supply (e.g. in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water saving solutions such as feet and other inexpensive options.
A crane with a foot pedal is a simple structure, consisting of a receptacle hung on a rope, and a knife lever, which should be pressed to hold water, and a piece of soap should be used.
The effective drying of hands is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but some disputes are under way regarding the most effective form of dry land in public toilets.
The growing amount of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.
A study was conducted by Westminster University in London in 2008, sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Salves and Coats, which compared the hygiene of paper towels, hot air dryers and more modern air dryers.
After washing and drying of hands in a warm air dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria on the fingertips increased by 194 per cent on average and 254 per cent on the system.
It was also found that after washing and drying hands in the airflow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips increased by 42 per cent and on the trays increased by 15 per cent.
After washing and drying the hands of paper towels, the total number of bacteria on fingertips is reduced to an average of 76 per cent, and on the latrines to 77 per cent, and scientists have also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-infection of several toilet visitors and the environment of the toilet in each type of dry area.
An air dryer that releases air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 m/h) is capable of blowing micro-organisms off its hands and from its own unit and potentially infecting other toilet users and sanusil within a radius of up to 2 m.
The use of hot-air dryers distributes micro-organisms within a radius of up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
In 2005 TÜV Product und Umwelt conducted a study on the assessment of various methods of dry hands.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the drying method of the hands:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers are compared to dry paper towels.
Clearing hands using disinfectable napkins can be an alternative during travel in the absence of soap and water.
The alcohol disinfectant shall contain at least 60 per cent of the alcohol.
The medical method of hand-washing became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignatz Zemmelweis discovered its high efficiency (in 1846) in the prevention of disease under permanent conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, the use of such devices certainly helps to reduce the level of contamination.
The medical wash of hands lasts at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be carefully pressed against each other by folding their fingers.
If there is dirt under the fingernails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water in their hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
A paper towel should be used after drying of the hands, closing the crane, and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors.
This avoids repeated contamination of hands from these surfaces.
The aim of handwashing in health facilities is to remove pathogens (microbes) and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that handwashing remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: many doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other basic procedures may reduce the level of catheter-related bleeding infections by 66 per cent; the World Health Organization has published a leaflet with a picture of the standard washing and handling procedure to be applied in the health sector.
The WHO draft manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open to public discussion.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby in co-sponsorship.
If compliance with the regulations is required, commercial devices may be used to measure the indicators and verify the hygiene of the hands.
The World Health Organization stands for “five moments” when it is necessary to wash hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
Antiseptics and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap when washing hands (“medical” or “antimicrobial” soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary prior to surgery or in the context of high levels of antibiotics-resistant organisms. The “cleaning” of hands before surgery requires a crane that can be turned on and off without touching its hands; a little chlorhexidine or iodine should also be used to polish the hands, sterile hand-drying towels after washing, a sterile brush brush and other sterile nail polishing tools.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires washing of hands and upper arms usually for 2-6 minutes.
There's no need to rub your hands too long, like 10 minutes.
During lusting, the water with the forearm should not fall back on the hands.
After the washing is finished, the hands dry with sterile tissue and put on a surgical gown.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic before and after taking care of a sick person.
In order to combat staphyoccal infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20 per cent of wash-offs were the most beneficial, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the hand washing rate was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared to washing with antibacterial soap, washing hands with regular soap leads to more than three times the rate of bacterial infectious diseases passed through food. Comparison of hand-contained alcohol-containing solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap, on average, 30 seconds per procedure, showed that the treatment of the hands containing the solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26 per cent compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than alcohol solutions for the hands, in reducing the number of A H1N1 influenza virus and Clostridiom deficile; hand hygiene activities in health facilities can include hand washing training, increased availability of spirit-containing solutions, and written and oral reminders to staff about the need to wash their hands.
Further research is needed on the most effective measures in different health facilities.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap has been recognized as a cost-effective and important means of improving health and even eating.
However, the lack of stable water, soap or handwashing in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to instill regular washing of hands.
For example, in most rural Africa, not every private or public toilet has taps for washing hands, although there are also cheap ways to wash hands in such places.
However, insufficient hygiene of hands can also be caused by entrenched habits, not by lack of soap or water.
Promoting and encouraging hand washing with soap can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term changes in public behaviour.
Monitoring and evaluation of results are needed to ensure the effectiveness of such measures.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies revealed that, in order to improve the health situation in the income countries below the average level, effective community-based sanitation and epidemiological surveillance, while public marketing campaigns were less effective; one example of advocacy for hand washing in schools was the approach of the Children's Fund of the United Nations, Three Star Approach, which promoted simple economic measures in schools that stimulate the hand washing of students using soap and other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can raise their levels from one to three stars.
The establishment of handcuffs is one of the possible measures in the context of the information campaigns on hand hygiene to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
Global Hand Wash Day is another example of a behavioural change information campaign, as a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of handwashing emodis.
Some studies looked at the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to the DALYs (conserved years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that hand washing with soap is a much more cost-effective solution than other sanitation measures.
The importance of handwashing for human health — especially for vulnerable people, such as young mothers or injured hospital soldiers — was first recognized in the middle of the 19th century by two innovators in the field of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), working in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale (Florence Nightingale), English nurse and “founder of modern care for patients”.
At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotting odors called myasms.
In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of diseases spread through food tracts and health-related infections, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have become more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters with “right hand washing equipment” were hung in public toilets, as well as in the bathrooms of office buildings and airports.
The phrase “washing hands” means that it is unwilling to accept responsibility for anything or to participate in anything.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate “washed his hands ” in making decisions about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; later this phrase became more widely used in some English communities.
In the play “Macbeth” Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands arbitrarily in an attempt to cleanse herself of the imaginary stain that symbolizes her unclean conscience in connection with the crimes that she committed herself and incited her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed any unethical act tended to wash their hands more often than other people, and handmaidens were more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who are able to wash their hands after they have seen will participate in any other “cleaning” compensatory activities, such as volunteering.
In religions handwashing is both a hygienic and symbolic goal. The symbolic washing of hands with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual of many religions, including Bahaism, Hinduism, tivilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hygienic washing of hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prescribe the mandatory washing of hands after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, washing hands before and after each meal is considered necessary.
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
Control of productive factors in relation to COVID-19 implies the application of methods of occupational safety and health to control and control the risks of 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper workplace risk control depends on the place and the job, based on risk assessment, the severity of the epidemic in the community and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The United States Office for Labour and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) reported that posts at a lower risk have minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures are required to combat infection, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home on grounds of illness, compliance with respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium-risk positions require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, but are likely to be infected with the current spread of disease in society or international travel.
These may include workers who are in contact with the public, for example in schools, the working environment with high population density and in some large retail shops.
Risk management measures for such a group, in addition to basic measures for the prevention of infection, include the use of high-efficiency air filters, the use of shields and personal protective equipment in the event of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that medical and mortician staff who have contacted a person with confirmed diagnosis or suspected infection of COVID-19 are at high risk; the risk is increased to a very high level when such staff are involved in aerosol procedures or in the collection/processing of samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such staff include the use of engineering security equipment, such as negative-pressure ventilation rooms and personal protection equipment suitable for the task.
An outbreak of COVID-19 may have different effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from the workplace because of their own illness, the need to care for other persons or the fear of possible contamination.
Commercial patterns may change both for the types of goods for which there is demand and for the means of acquiring such goods (e.g. non-scrupulous purchases with delivery or maintenance, without leaving the car).
Finally, there may be disruptions in the delivery of goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The Action Plan for Preparedness and Responses can be used to organize protection.
The plans address the risks associated with different jobs and tasks, including sources of contamination, risk factors, home and community, as well as risk factors for individual workers, such as older age or chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the means of control necessary to address such risks, as well as emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Plans for epidemic preparedness and response may be subject to national or state recommendations.
Some of the objectives of responding to the epidemic: reducing the spread of the virus among staff, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing the negative effects on other organizations in their supply chains.
Responses have an impact on the severity of diseases in the business community.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a broad-based structure used in occupational safety and hygiene to group such funds according to efficiency.
If it is not possible to address the risk of COVID-19, the most effective technical safety equipment is the administrative measures and, finally, the means of personal protection.
Engineering security means the isolation of staff from workplace risks and does not rely on the employee ' s behaviour, which may be the most economically beneficial solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in working policies or procedures requiring action from a worker or a staff member.
Personal protection (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help to address certain risks.
All types of personal protection should be selected according to the threat to the worker, be of the size (e.g., Respirators), used continuously and appropriately, checked regularly, maintained in good condition and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of in order to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Office for Labour Protection and Industrial Health (OSHA) believes that posts at least at risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
The basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all jobs include frequent and thorough hand-washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with the respiratory label, including hand-coughing, hand-coughing, napkins and garbage containers, readiness for remote or replacement work, as appropriate, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, as well as daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of persons who may be potentially infected is a critical step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that staff with symptoms of acute respiratory disease remain at home until the heat is stopped, that there is no fever and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of hot springs or other medications to correct symptoms, and that they be able to provide flexibility to the hospital leaf policy, allow staff to stay at home to care for a sick family member and ensure that staff are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of not more than six feet (18 m) with people who do not have confirmed data or suspected of being infected by COVID-19, but are likely to be infected by SARS-COV-2 due to the spread of disease in a society in the territory of business or the recent travel of such person to the places of circulation of COVID-19.
These include workers who have had contact with the public, e.g. in schools, the working environment with high population density and some large retail stores. Engineering safety tools for such groups and groups at higher risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation, physical barriers such as transparent plastic protection screens, and the installation of non-cash duty boxes. Administrative measures for such group and groups include recommendations for higher-risk workers to stay at home, replace personal communication meetings by virtual means, establishing replacement schedules, ending non-critical travel in places of distribution of CVID-19, development of communication plans for such groups and higher-risk groups, including a forum for responses to disturbing workers, providing relevant training for risk factors of CVID-19 and protection measures, training of non-cash means of communication, emergency situations, including a forum for responses to disturbing workers, providing timely training for staff at risk, training of staff who need to be used by the professional service provider, to assist the labour force and to assist the service provider, to assist in rendering the legal profession, to the service provider, and to assist in the service industry, and to the service of the service services of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service, the service of the service, the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service of the service.
In rare cases, workers from such a group may need to wear respiratory agents.
If a person has become ill on an aircraft, measures such as the isolation of a sick person from another person 6 feet away, the appointment of a crew member to care for a sick person, the provision of a sick mask or the treatment of such a person to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin in coughing or sneezing.
Secondary crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveller or in contact with physiological liquids or potentially infected surfaces and possibly additional personal protection if the patient has a fever, regular cough or difficulty breathing.
Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and contaminated surfaces should be subsequently cleaned and disinfected; in cases of commercial navigation, including cruise liners and other passenger vessels, safety measures include delaying the journey in case of illness, self-insulation and immediately informing the medical centre on board if there is heat or other symptoms on board.
In the case of schools and childcare institutions, CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is in a school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or mean level of infection in the community, social distance strategies may be introduced, such as cancellation of visits to personal meetings, assemblies and other mass events such as physical or choral foam, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between parties, adjusting arrival and care, limiting non-existent visits, and using a separate location of health care facilities for children with flu symptoms.
In addition to social distance strategies, long-term non-school measures may be considered at a significant rate of distribution in the local community, and direct health risks are considered a low risk for law enforcement officials, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of infection of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same instructions as those prescribed for ambulances, including the use of appropriate personal protection equipment.
In the event of close contact during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their formal belts and crews before reuse by domestic cleaning aerosols, or by rubbing them, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and the disposal of used personal protective equipment, as well as the use and washing of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and mortuary workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical, support, laboratory and medical personnel in contact with patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected infection of COVID-19.
They have a very high risk of contamination in the conduct of a process accompanied by aerosol education, or in collecting/processing samples from persons diagnosed with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected infection of COVID-19.
Procedures associated with aerosol education include probes, coughing procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and surveys or invasive sampling.
The employees of high-risk morticians include staff dealing with the treatment of persons with confirmed disease or suspected infection of COVID-19 at the time of their death; if such officers are performing autopsy, they are placed at very high risk; additional engineering and safety tools for such risk groups include the use of isolated premises for patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19, including in procedures accompanied by aerosol education.
In some health facilities and morgues, the use of special ventilation with negative pressure can be an effective measure.
Samples should be subject to precautionary measures for biological safety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be allocated to a range of waiting zones, depending on the availability of COVID-19 infection suspects. In addition to other personal protection tools, OSHA recommends that respiratory agents be used to interact up to 6 feet in distance with patients with confirmed disease or suspected of being infected by SARS-COV-2 as well as those accompanying aerosol education.
In the United States, the NIOSH-approved Respirators for the N95 filter or higher class should be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection programme that sets out the requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for the staff member. WHO does not recommend special use since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for screening staff at the point of admission.
WHO recommends that patients with COVID-19 or carriers who collect samples from the airways without aerosol treatments wear a surgical mask, protective glasses or face, robes and gloves.
In procedures accompanied by aerosol education, a Respirator N95 or FFP2 should be worn instead of a surgical mask.
In view of the lack of individual protection worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protections by using remote medicine, physical barriers, such transparent corners, ensuring access to a patient infected with COVID-19 only those who provide direct care, using only those personal protections that are necessary for a specific task, long-term use of the same respiratory agent, without having to remove, in dealing with several patients with identical diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protective equipment and not using masks for persons with no symptoms.

DECISIONS: CC0: Protected rights not available
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interrelationship of people around the world and our responsibility to one another.
We had no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the capacity to empathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is the foundation of such an organization.
We have observed friendly and caring relations among all our colleagues, as reflected in electronic correspondence, phone calls, and chats — a remarkable demonstration of the fact that, fortunately, we are being accompanied by amazing people.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of the appreciation of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to approach Wikipedia right now and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
This is possible because of your work, whether to ensure the working capacity of our websites, to pay our colleagues or to protect the security of our communities.
Peace needs information in Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever before.
At a time when it is important to achieve meaningful results for the world, not only what we do but also how we do it.
With regard to the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the order of our joint work, starting with the coming week.
Adjustments to our working order and schedules
As Robin was previously told, the c-team team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
During our communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and on how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The vast majority of us wanted to lift the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to resign, so be it.
For all staff, contractors and non-staff:
It will be necessary, as expected, to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before further orders are received.
We do not announce holidays: if you can work normally for more hours, this is allowed for the purpose of our mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs, whether you care about your family, get food or go to a doctor, your well-being is our number one priority.
We don't keep track of your working time.
If you are ill, you should not work.
It's understandable and indisputable, but we mention it.
There is no need to form a hospital sheet or offset: simply inform your manager and help the command to review the calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, please report Brian from T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and due attention from the leadership to your situation).
The hourly rate will be paid in full.
We have already announced and reaffirm our intention to honour our commitments to our contractors and hourly staff.
Everyone will receive payment according to the usual hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This includes periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can have amazing results, especially in such times.
Again, it is self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered significant.
Such activities must always be supported.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising (other) are doing critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess the current objectives and place emphasis on providing support, which is critical to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we just focus on the most important projects.
Deceleration today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work “double more to make up for what has been missed” after the pandemic has ended.
You won't have to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and deadlines, if possible.
What happens to APP (annual plans)?
In order to build on the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the implementation date of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for budgeting, which will enable staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care for loved ones, with a reduced timetable for the next few weeks for all those who need or who want to work.
This extension allows for a significant reduction in the current planning and tension burden throughout the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, the representatives and the teams concerned with relevant information on the following steps immediately after receipt of the confirmation.
Thank you, the APP team, for taking the lead in this work.
State of the office, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to many precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used antiviral solutions from the medical class to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception and elevator halls, through which access to our floors could be made possible.
The building has its own rules of caution, using products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared by the time we return.
Our office in the district of Colombia (DC) is on the WeWork network, which shared with us and all the personnel in DC their COVID-19 rules.
Last week, our office in the district of Colombia went completely to remote work, in accordance with instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our New York colleagues know, we have also discussed the rental of a room in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work away for the first time.
Our old colleagues, working far away, are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended to limit the duration of meetings to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider breaking them into a course of several days.
Set out clearly the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and send out the information in advance.
By default, use video communication, and use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate communication and communication.
For ease of reference, appoint a focal point — a person who will monitor chat questions and monitor the list of speakers, as well as a notekeeper (or a joint comment).
If necessary, please contact the Technical Support Service by e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement program when buying snacks.
Join the #remotes channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomics available in web-based format to promote the effectiveness of distributed work throughout the organization.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel the mass activities funded by Wikimedia, such as “editathons”, until WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may lead to the impossibility of carrying out concerted grant activities, and no one will be affected by forced delays or changes in such objectives.
In the coming week, we will undertake follow-up activities with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
General sentiments in the global community are not only an outrage at the interruption of work, but also a sense of relief in terms of understanding and the ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and not only.
With regard to prospects, CRT is working on a Meta Wiki page that will provide space for the community to monitor impacts and communication.
We remain in touch on issues related to COVID-19.
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time we will take advantage of the opportunity to further share relevant information, to answer your questions and to spend time with each other.
We're in this situation together, and we're ready to help everything we can.
You can also continue to receive information from such e-mails and other important information about COVID-19 from Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries affected by the current situation.
If you have any questions about travel, events, key workflow, problems with reporting or other assistance, please contact CRT.
We are ready to provide support and communication as necessary.
If there are problems of confidentiality, please contact Brian Judan, director of HR International Global Operations, by e-mail.
No such change should be seen as abandoning our work and our obligations.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support one another and to provide the opportunity to continue working to provide the necessary support to our movement and the world through the necessary service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today is the time to support one another and to create space for the important work ahead of the week and perhaps months.
In order for this to happen, we will need the help of each of you; and we need you to be able to care for yourself and your families as well as to work with the greatest benefit as soon as such needs arise.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grand I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membrane) of the cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the respective angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), reducing the angiotensin-II content and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as a point of entry for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal ferment located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-continuous peptidase domain of M2 and the C-continuous transport domain of the renal amino acid complex.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane of type I protein, and its fermentedly active domain reaches the surface of the lungs and other tissues.
The non-cellular domain of ACE2 is detached from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as seddase, and the resulting dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted in urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cellular membrane of most of the alveolar lung type II cells, thin intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of most organs.
Biosynthesis ACE2 and IRNA are also found in the cortex of the brain, the stratum, the hypothalamus, and the trunk of the brain.
The principal function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE anti-venom.
ACE splits angiotensin I hormone into co-stimulating angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, unlocks and hydrolysates the carbon dioxide-end amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) into vasodilatator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also split up a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] - bradykinin, appelin, neurotensine, dinorphine A and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the SLC6A19 neutral amino transporter and is present in Hartnup.
As a transmembrance protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-COV (SARS-COV virus); and SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19 virus).
Strictly speaking, the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the fermented domain of the ACE2 on the surface of the cells results in endocytosis and transfer of both the virus and the enzyme to the endosoms inside the cells.
This process of entry also requires the absorption of a protein with a serum protease medium TMPRSS2, which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent, which has led some to believe that reducing the levels of ACE2 in cells can help to combat infection.
Nevertheless, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing standard therapy by ATP and BRA inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors was due to a 34 per cent reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group”.
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who received APF inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, particularly stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia deaths, although the results were less reliable than patients at common risk of pneumonia.”
The recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a novelty in the treatment of acute lung damage and may improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation from the acute respiratory insufficiency caused by lipo-saccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the duration of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the duration of exposure at 24 hours.
Some data indicate that rhACE2 may become a promising tool for people with classical angiotensin-renin inhibitors ( RAS-inhibitors) or for diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is increased. The rhACE2 introduced was evaluated in clinical trials in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile phones designed to assist in the epidemiological investigation in the context of the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-20, i.e. in the identification of persons (“contacts”) who were able to contact the infected person.
In some regions, many applications officially supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed.
Several options for contact tracking applications have been developed.
This gave rise to a discussion of confidentiality issues, especially those based on monitoring of the geographical location of applications.
The softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to register the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate support functions based on Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government, together with Alipay, has set up an app that allows citizens to check whether they have been associated with people infected by COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore uses an app called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be transmitted to the Government. Northern Macedonia launched the StopKrona! application, working on Bluetooth, helping to track contacts with potentially infected people and to ensure operational communication with health authorities.
The annex was developed jointly by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As at 14 April 2020, the annex was awaiting registration in Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking app was at the final stage and would be available for deployment within a few weeks. Similar applications are planned to be launched in Ireland and in France (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand are considering using the application based on the Singapore application TraceTogether and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an application with a geozonation function to ensure that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security at Cambridge University, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise with applications, including false responses and potential inefficiency in the case of applications to only a small part of the population.
In view of the concern about the proliferation of misleading or harmful “coronavirus” applications, Apple has restricted the list of types of organizations that may offer its applications related to the coronavirus to the App Store, including only “official” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
The members of the campaign for protection of confidentiality expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance on the population through the coronavirus-related annexes; in particular, the question was raised whether the monitoring infrastructure established to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the restriction of such oversight.
Organizations have announced eight conditions for public projects:
Monitoring must be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
The extension of monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by limitation clauses;
The use of data shall be limited to the objectives of combating the proliferation of COVID-19;
data security and anonymity must be protected and evidence of such security provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude cases of increased discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be defined at the legislative level;
Protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse should be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple propose their joint plan to address the problem of continuous monitoring, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their operating systems as soon as the need to do so disappears.
In some countries, network tracking is used instead of applications, which excludes loading of the app and avoids tracking.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network solutions that have access to baseline location data also have major potential problems with confidentiality.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of systems have been developed to maintain confidentiality, which use central servers only for communications (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application system was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including tracking of mobile devices and transactions with maps, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages sent to potentially infected persons.
Not only did the Government use this information to warn citizens of potential contacts with infected persons, but it also made information about the location of the public, which was possible due to significant changes in the legislation protecting information that had been made since the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites, and countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized systems and systems that maintain confidentiality.
As of 6 April 2020, details have not yet been made public.
Monitoring of contacts that maintain confidentiality is a strong concept, a considerable amount of research literature dated at least in 2013. As at 7 April 2020, more than ten expert groups worked on confidential solutions such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized tracer with confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols for confidentiality, mobile tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that the identified personal data never leave the device and that all comparisons take place on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform for maintaining confidentiality in the collection and use of location or intersection data to monitor the circulation of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on the studies of Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic, published in March 2020 by the other similar project, the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, the company developing technology for confidentiality, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies to allow users to exchange confidential data on the location and state of health with other users and officials without risking the confidentiality of these data.
On 5 April 2020, a global coalition of TCNs was established by groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols to reduce fragmentation and ensure global compatibility of monitoring and alert applications, which is a key factor in their wide dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore Government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official annex.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track contacts that they claimed would be confidential and based on the combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography technology to preserve confidentiality.
They also published the technical characteristics of the essential technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
The deployment of tools to enable Governments to establish official applications to monitor movements of nationals infected with coronavirus, but with confidentiality of data
Integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple are planning to solve problems with constant monitoring, first introducing the system through the upgrade of the operating system and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappeared.
Repositioning of a medicinal product (also known as re-profiling, diversion, task modification or therapeutic transfer) is the re-profiling of an approved medicinal product for treatment of a disease or medical condition other than a disease originally prescribed for development.
This is one of the areas of scientific research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a vaccine from COVID-19 and the transfusion of recombinant plasma. SARS-COV-2 contains about 66 proteins that are susceptible to medication, each of which has several ligand-binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides an appropriate basis for the development of an effective antiviral agent against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papay-like protease, RNA-dependent polymerase RNA, helicasis, S protein and ADF-ribofosphatase.
Hussain AA and co-sponsors in their Doklin study examined several candidate compounds, which were then optimized, and analysed their similarity to the structure with the most commonly approved drugs to accelerate the development of a highly effective preparation against SARS-CoV-2, which will be recommended for clinical studies.
Chlorochine is an antimalarial medicine that is also used to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and associated hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the “Solidarity” clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Kuomo announced that the tests of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would start in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate in accordance with an emergency authorisation (EUA).
The treatment regimen has not been approved during the FDA clinical trials and is allowed under EUA only as a pilot treatment for emergency care in patients who have been hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under clinical testing schemes.
CDC stated that “the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection” has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use a drug when there is no other way out.
A Turkish study group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine combined with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale studies are conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University medical school in Langon is studying the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Uhane and Shenchen showed that favirvir is “singularly effective”.
The 35 patients in Shenchen who took the medicine received a negative result on average after 4 days, while 45 patients who did not take the medicine had 11 days.
A study was conducted in Ukhana that monitored 240 patients with pneumonia, one half of whom received faviravir, and the other half with imifenvir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the results of the drug ' s effectiveness were scarce and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase a drug in Japan to replenish its stocks, and that it would be used by military resources to deliver it to university hospitals where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Sinzo Abe informed the Trump Administration about the possibility of purchasing a drug, and the drug may be less effective in cases of run-off.
Its use may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to become pregnant.
A study on the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals concluded that “the effectiveness of the use of drugs has not been established”.
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a connection that will be linked to the SARS-Cov-2 protease. In the scientific community, the re-profiling of drugs that have been specifically developed for HIV and AIDS therapy is critical.
WHO included a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international test “Solidarity”.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections. Subsequently, Gilead Science staff discovered that remdesiver has antiviral activity in vitro with regard to the multiple philo-, pneumo-, paramixo- and coronaviruses.
A problem related to antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transfer.
Some early preliminary studies show that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance; several clinical trials are currently being conducted, including two at Cleveland University Clinics; one at moderately ill patients and the other at patients with a more severe condition.
Three clinical trials are currently being conducted for the intravenous administration of vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a serious COVID-19 form: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
Tests on the antibiotics of azithromycin began in New York State on 24 March 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical study on Alvesco (cyclesonide) of Tejin, an inhalation corticosteroid for asthma treatment, to treat pre-symptomous patients infected with a new coronavirus.
Phase II test, the form of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, is carried out with the participation of 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe forms of disease with a view to determining the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mildly pronounced symptoms of COVID-19.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 years and over were invited, diagnosed with COVID-19, with light symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Pregnant, breast-fed and non-contraceptive women cannot participate in the study.
Italy has several coagulations on the test.
Low-compolecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Department of Medicinal Products to publish recommendations on the use of this medicine.
A multicentre study involving 300 patients on the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on re-profiling approved antivirals that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations.
Umifenvir: imifenvir was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been considered potentially suitable for treatment with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (receptor anti-IL-6): approved in China.
See also the tests in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been tested, many attempts to develop such a vaccine continue to be made.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 to be obtained earlier than 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates conducted phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of this disease spread worldwide, leading to significant investments in vaccine formulation and research in its context.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-COV-2.
As announced in April, the key challenges of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are ensuring the required speed, production capacity, large deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were in place to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the phase I safety research platform are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, IRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, Type 5 adenovir vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines were at an early stage of development, 78 of them were used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 additional candidate vaccines were claimed, but little information was available (probably in planning or development).
In phases I to II, preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing is carried out, generally randomized, placebo-controlled and several sites with a more accurate and effective dose definition.
Phase III tests usually cover more participants, including the control group; at this stage, drugs are tested for disease prevention efficacy while monitoring side effects in optimal dosages.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in human beings (are still in the pre-clinical studies).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular-challenge vaccine that genetically modified viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
On 24 January 2020, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the launch of its own vaccine to start testing in 2021.
The initiation of vaccine development projects was also announced at the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies led by Hanneke Schuitmaker announced the launch of their vaccine.
Janssen is developing an oral vaccine with his biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a productive partnership with Vaxart for vaccine development.
OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a technology vaccine similar to that used for cancer neoantigen vaccination on 8 February 2020.
On 25 March, the head of the Research Institute announced the completion of the work on the synthesis of the vaccine and the initiation of the tests.
On 27 February 2020, the daughter-in-law of Geneex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that a project for the development of a peptide vaccine Ii-Key v. COVID-19 had begun.
Their aim was to develop a vaccine candidate that could be tested on humans in 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Logistics Command, Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reed Research Research Institute, Silver Spring, located in the western part of Maryland State, announced that they were developing their vaccine.
On 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosoluations announced that it had entered a partnership with Novavax Inc.
for the development and production of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for stage I trials and clinical trials by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients, and that even under accelerated vaccination regime it would take at least one and a half years.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company, Quebec, reported that partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Research had created a particle similar to the coronavirus.
A potential vaccine is carried out in laboratory studies and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "large cash" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, against which the German Government had protested.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an iRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162 is a candidate for iRNA-based vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing clinical trials and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, the Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that it would receive the results of the final tests in April 2020, and their final vaccine candidate could start testing on humans in autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the Institute of Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh announced an investment of $4.9 million in a consortium for the development of a vaccine from COVID-19 with the participation of the Institute of Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
Other investment partners in CEPI are Moderna, Curevac, Inovo, Novavax, Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland universities.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different vaccine candidates for animals.
The researchers of Imperial College, London, announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-ablivable COVID19 RNA.
A vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of obtaining consistency from China.
In late March, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of multiple vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan.
At the same time, the Canadian Government announced a special allocation of $192 million to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans to create a national “vaccination bank”, which would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new outbreak of the coronavirus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the Pittsburgh Medical School reported testing PittCoVac, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, stating that “MNA introduced the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines, causing strong responses to the [mouse] antigen-specific antibodies that occurred two weeks after immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian Pharmaceutical School of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine that may be produced in the form of a nasal spray.
With the help of DNA bacteria, it will reproduce within human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to develop antibodies against the SARS-Cov-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, industry and three U.S. universities merged the resources of IBM supercomputers, combined with cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called nonspecific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages than those of disease prevention.
Another randomised study in Australia covers 4,170 health workers.
The vaccines developed may not be safe or ineffective.
Early studies on the evaluation of the efficacy of animal vaccines, which are characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need to contain biosafety 3 infection in the processing of living viruses, as well as international coordination of the provision of standardized safety procedures.
Vaccinations against SARS and MERS were protested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no medicines or protective vaccines that are safe and effective for people to treat SARS.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of new vaccines and medications for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world.
When MERS began to spread, it was considered that the SARS study at that time could become a standard for the development of vaccines and therapies against MERS-CAV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) vaccine from MERS, which passed phase I clinical trials on humans, and three other vaccines, all of which were viral vector-based vaccines, two of which were adenovirus (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
The conspiracy theory was spreading on social networks, claiming that the COVID-19 virus was not new at all and that the vaccine was already in existence.
Publications in social networks quoted the words of some patients who claimed that there were patents on the genetic sequences of other strains of the coronavirus, such as SARS, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19) that is an infectious disease caused by severe acute coronary respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include feeling tired, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of breath and abdominal pain.
The time from the first occurrence of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but may also range from two to fourteen days.
Most cases occur with mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease flows to viral pneumonia and polyorganism deficiency.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection were recorded in 210 countries and regions, with more than 153 000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus is mainly transmitted when people are in close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops emitted into the air by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although these drops are formed in exhalation, they are usually a threat to the ground or to the surface, but are not transmitted through air at long distances.
Humans are also infected with contaminated surfaces and then with their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is most infected within the first three days after symptoms have occurred, although it can be spread both before symptoms occur and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR) on a form taken as a nasal swab.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspected disease as well as for caregivers.
The recommendations on the use of medical masks vary from one person to another: some authorities recommend not using them at all, some recommend using them, and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.
Local prevalence of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may have no symptoms or symptoms of influenza such as fever, coughing, fatigue and retrieval.
Extreme symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant pain or feeling depressed in the chest, confusion of consciousness, difficulty waking up, bruising of the face or lips; if the symptoms listed above are present, seek medical attention immediately.
Symptoms of upper respiratory tracts such as sneezing, stomping, or sore throat may be less common.
Also, there are various percentages of gastric and gut symptoms, such as fat, mercury and diarrhoea.
Some of the cases reported in China were initially only a feeling of chest depression and frequent heartbeat.
In some cases, disease can progress in pneumonia, polyorganism deficiency, and eventually death.
It's called an incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5 per cent of people have symptoms within 11.5 days of infection, and not all patients are reported to have symptoms.
While the role of such unsymptomatic carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, preliminary data indicate that they can contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of infected people with an unsymptomable disease is currently unknown, it is only being studied; while the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Centres (KCDCs) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations related to the virus were unsymptomatic.
The National Health Commission of China began to include symptoms in its daily report as of 1 April; out of 166 cases of infection recorded on that day, 130 (78 per cent) were denied symptoms at the time of testing.
Both wet and saliva can have a high concentration of the virus.
With loud talk, there are more drops in the air than there is normal noise.
A study conducted in Singapore found that, in an open cough, drops can extend to a distance of up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
The virus is not normally transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transfer of particles of the virus by bioaerosolon is still possible, and the testing of air by air collectors located in corridors outside the human room has shown viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiac and pulmonary resuscitation (SDR), may lead to the dispersion of the exhalation products and, therefore, to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus may spread through feces, however, this risk is considered to be low; the virus is the most contagious when people experience symptoms; the virus may spread before symptoms occur, but this risk is low.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that it is not yet clear how easily the virus is spreading, but it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 others. The virus is able to survive on the surface for several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on the cardboard surface the virus was able to live for one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days and on 99% of copper surfaces for up to 4 hours.
These indicators, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
The soap and cleaning agents, when properly used, have a rather useful effect in combating contamination: soap destroys the fat protective layer of the virus, thus deactivating it, and is able to remove it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzolconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against the virus, and in a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalisation.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and the sixth patient identified the highest levels of the virus in the blood on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new severe acute coronary respiratory syndrome that was first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Ucana.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in natives of the nature of coronaviruses.
While outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by a household soap that opens its protective shell. SARS-COV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-COV.
The light is the organ most susceptible to the effects of COVID-19 because the virus penetrates into the housing cell through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most common in alveolar light cell type II.
The virus is connected to ACE2 and penetrated into the holding cell by means of the characteristic surface glycoprotein, “shipa” (peplomer).
Twelve per cent of infected people in the Ukhana hospital were diagnosed with acute myocardial injury, which is more common in severe forms of disease.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during disease progression, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The AC2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities as they participate in the work of this body.
High platelet frequency (31 per cent) and venous thromboembolism (25 per cent) were observed in patients in COVID-19 and may indicate adverse prognosis. Autopsy of patients killed by COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and lymphocytostitis in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropical effect on ACE2-expressive epithelial airway cells, patients with severe COVID-19 experience symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it has been found that T-cells of GM-XSF pathogens are correlated with the recruitment of inflammatory monociths that release IL-6 and the severe pathology of light in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrations were also detected at the opening.
WHO has also published several testing protocols for this disease.
The real-time polymerization chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard test method.
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained from a nasal swab but may also be using a nasal or wet swab.
The results are usually ready for several hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks, and their results are of no direct relevance.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate the strain of the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can develop their own polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of the virus.
As at 4 April 2020, antibody tests that could detect current infection and possible contamination in the past were under development but have not yet been widely disseminated.
The Chinese experience in examining the results of the tests showed that they were only 60 to 70 per cent accurate.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Quality Control Authority (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test to be approved at the end of this month.
Bilateral multi-lower subpleural sealing functions by type of matte glass with peripheral, asymmetric and aesthetic distribution are frequent symptoms identified at an early stage of the disease.
Sub-pleural domination, mucosa bridge symptom (a prolonged thickening of the partition with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
There are few data on microscopic damage and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
Main findings of the autopsy pathology study:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, swelling and swelling of the lungs
Four types of viral pneumonia may be observed:
pneumonia: lung swelling, pneumonia hyperplasia, large atypical pneumonias, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinuclear giant cells
Severe pneumonia form: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exsudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoxaemia.
Pneumonia: organization of alveolars and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: Diffusion intravascular discharge (VAS); leukoerythrlastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include housekeeping, avoiding human places, frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, compliance with respiratory health rules, and avoiding eye, nose or mouth contact with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, cover the mouth and nose inside the elbow area of the hand.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended that a quality hygiene procedure be carried out for the hands.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that tissue masks be used in public areas, in particular to limit the transmission of infections to people with an unfavourable period of disease; social distance strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; schools and enterprises have been shut down in these measures, restrictions on the movement of citizens, and major public activities have been cancelled.
The distance recommendations also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
Since the vaccine is expected to be completed no earlier than 2021, the majority of measures against the spread of COVID-19 are to reduce the peak of the epidemic known as “output”.
CDC also recommends more frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or when the hands are severely contaminated, as well as before and after snorting, coughing or sneezing.
CDC also recommends the use of a disinfectant (a spirit content of at least 60 per cent) for handling hands, but only when soap and water are not available. WHO provides two prescriptions for local production to regions where such disinfectants are not sold.
They use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not an appropriate tool for antiseptic hand-processing.
Glycerol is added as moisturizer.
Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect that the virus is infected wear a normal medical mask.
Extra-corporal membrane oxidation (ECMO) was used to address respiratory insufficiency, but its benefits are still being studied.
Personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to strengthen immunity.
Supportive therapies can be shown to patients with mild symptoms at early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for care for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, doctors of intensive therapy and pulmonologists summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various agencies in a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment of COVID-19.
For the treatment of symptoms as first-line drugs, some health professionals recommend choosing paracetamol (acetaminophen) as compared to ibuprofen.
Care should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health facilities, in the execution of procedures in which air-capulative emissions may occur.
CDC recommends that medical personnel caring for persons with COVID-19 be placed in an air-cape insulator (AIIR) - an additional measure, in addition to standard contact and air precautions. CDC issued recommendations on the use of personal protection tools (CISs) during a pandemic.
The recommended means of personal protection: protective robe, respiratory mask or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves, and the above-mentioned means are preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.
Respirators N95 were approved for industrial use, but the FDA authorized the use of these respirators in accordance with the emergency authorisation (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but are not guaranteed by instructions to protect against a specific biological agent.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends that protective facial screens be used or, at the very least, masks be made on their own in the home environment.
In most cases, COVID-19 is not difficult enough to require artificial ventilation of the lungs or their alternatives, but there is a certain percentage of cases where this is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory deficiency associated with COVID-19 is currently being studied actively, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided by a nasal oxygen canal with intense air flow or two-level respiratory pressure.
It is not yet known whether any of these two ways are as effective for patients in critical condition as the IVL.
Some doctors choose to use invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs if available, as this method significantly limits the proliferation of particles in the air compared to the nasal duct with an intense airflow. The risk of severe disease for older people (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
In many developed countries, hospital beds are lacking per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the sharp increase in cases of COVID-19 infection in severe form requiring hospitalization.
One study in China showed that 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive care, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for light ventilation and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30 per cent of the people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually resuscitated.
The challenge of artificial ventilation of the lungs is complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developing at COVID-19 and oxygenation is becoming more and more problematic.
IVL with inhaled pressure support and PACW is necessary to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure minimal damage to ventilation, which may result in the development of a pneumothorax.
On earlier models of fans, high VAT may not be available.
Studies of potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antivirals are currently being tested in clinical trials.
Remdesivir is the most promising.
The development of new drugs may take up to 2021, but some of the tested drugs have already been approved for other purposes or are at the latest stages of testing.
Antivirals can be tested in patients with severe forms of disease.
The recommended WHO volunteers are involved in testing the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments, and the FDA has granted temporary permission to use recombinant plasma as experimental treatment in cases where human life is in serious or immediate danger.
Its use was not subject to clinical studies that should be conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to combat outbreaks.
The user must enter his name and identification number to enter the login.
The app can detect close contact by means of monitoring data and therefore identify the potential risk of contamination.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is identified, the app not only recommends self-insulation but also sends a notification to local health authorities. Large data collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and persons contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to monitor mobile phone data for people allegedly infected by the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, with a view to researching and preventing the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, it provided Germany and Robert Koh Institute with aggregated data on the location of hundreds of subscribers.
In Russia, identification technology was introduced to identify quarantine violators.
Italy's Regional Health Commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said that hundreds of network operators reported that “40 per cent of people continue to move around the territory”.
The German Government conducted a 48-hour weekend programming marathon involving more than 42,000 participants.
President Kersti Kaleway of Estonia also called for creative solutions against the proliferation of the coronavirus.
People may be stressed about quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: “Enhanced social isolation, loneliness, concern about health, stress and economic decline — ideal conditions for harming mental health and the well-being of people”.
The disease may occur in mild form with minor or absent symptoms similar to other common upper respiratory tract diseases such as common colds.
Patients with mild disease tend to recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may require three to six weeks to be treated.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of receiving severe COVID-19 on the basis of data on other such viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although there are no such data for COVID-19.
For those with the most severe disease course, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or polyorganism deficiency.
The complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, anomalous thrombosis, and heart, kidney and liver problems.
Thrombotic abnormalities, particularly increases in prothrombin time, were reported in 6 per cent of patients who entered the hospital with COVID-19, while 4 per cent of these patients experienced renal impairment.
About 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 had elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to intensive care was seven days.
According to early-stage disease studies, the average time from baseline to day of death was 14 days with a complete range of six to 41 days.
According to a study by the National Commission for Health of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8 per cent and among women was 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological studies of post-mortem lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromixoid exudates in both lungs.
Pneumocytes observed viral cytopathic changes.
The appearance was easily similar to that of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS).
In 11.8 per cent of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were caused by increased troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and access to health resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality vary depending on the condition due to such regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Inadequate calculation of mild cases could lead to overestimation of mortality.
Nevertheless, the fact that death occurs as a result of past diseases may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers generally developed severe COVID-19 symptoms 1.4 times more frequently, and such patients were approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive therapy or die than non-smokers.
The administration of a Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who had recovered from the disease had a slight reduction of 20-30 per cent and their scans had detected injuries.
After recovery, this may also lead to “After intensive therapy”.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients emerging from the virus developed persistent immunity against them.
According to the flow of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but it has also been reported that after recovery from COVID-19 the tests for the coronavirus were still positive.
In these cases, it is believed that there has been a severed prolonged period of disease rather than re-infection.
The virus is considered to be natural, has animal origin and constitutes an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human transmission.
The first 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases, published in The Lancet on January 2020, are named 1 December 2019 at the earliest date of the first case.
According to WHO official data, this date is 8 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All numbers vary according to region and time of disease spread, and are also affected by testing levels, quality of health systems, treatment schemes used, time of outbreak and population parameters such as age, gender and overall health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO attributed emergency codes to ICB-10: U07.1 for deaths from laboratory confirmed SARS-COV-2 and U07.2 for deaths from clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-COV-2 infection. The ratio of deaths and infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a certain period of time.
According to statistics from the University of Jones Hopkins, as at 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191).
Some other methods include the determination of the disease mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the proportion of diagnosed patients who died as a result of the disease, as well as the determination of the mortality rate as a result of the transmitted infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of a certain population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced in all patients who have been infected, the number of people infected can be seen in the presence of these antibodies.
At the flashpoint in Italy, Castillon d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 people (1.7 per cent) are no longer alive.
In the town of Gangelt, disease spread during the celebration of carnival among young people, causing relatively lower deaths, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population can have antibodies, according to the donor blood rate.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates is different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher among men.
The highest risk group is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women has been reduced only since the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but they may be genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender immunological differences, a lower prevalence of smoking among women associated with male diseases (e.g., hypertension in men who are younger than women) may lead to higher male deaths.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected were male, and 72 per cent of COVID-19 deaths were male.
As of April 2020, the United States Government does not maintain gender statistics on COVID-19.
Studies have shown that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and ODS, have different gender statistics.
The majority of health workers, especially nurses, are women, respectively, who are more likely to be infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
WHO leader Tedros Adanom Gebreisus explains: “CO” means “Korona”, “VI” “virus”, “D” (disease), and 19 when the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), species of animals or groups of people, as required by international recommendations on the name to prevent stigmatization. The virus caused by COVID-19 is called acute coronary respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
WHO uses the terms “COVID-19” and “COVID-19 virus” further in its public reports.
Both the disease and the virus themselves are commonly referred to as the “kronavirus”.
During the initial outbreak in Utah, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as “kronavirus” and “Uhanksk’s coronavirus”.
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical sites in disease and virus names, WHO recommended the use of the terms “serious respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCOV” as temporary names of the virus and disease.
On 11 February 2020, the official names “COVID-19” and “SARS-COV-2” were published.
Due to the limitations of standard supply chains, some digital service providers print medical supplies, such as nose swabs, as well as details of IVL devices.
In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time period, then one of the local productions was reconfigured and was able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19 broke out, various conspiracy theories, misinformation and fairy tales on the origin of the virus, its extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects began to spread on the Internet.
It's likely that humans can infect other animals with the virus.
The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, esophagus and chickens.
At present, there is no approved vaccine for virus or medicinal products for its treatment.
Various international studies of vaccines and medicines from COVID-19 are currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO initiated SOLIDARITY Trial (SOLIDARITY TEST), which aims to assess the therapeutic effect of the four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
A vaccine is not yet available, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Both SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 penetrate into human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so scientific research uses the results of previous studies on SARS-COV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers seek to create a whole virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to induce a rapid immune response of the human body to the new infection of COVID-19.
The second strategy, the creation of a subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that enhances the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at destroying S-schipular protein, which helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA-vaccin, a new method of vaccine formation).
Experimental vaccines developed in any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of the vaccine in four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. An antithyroidism has been identified as a potential problem in the development of vaccines from SARS-COV-2, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are conducted.
The drugs approved for malaria treatment were assessed during seven trials, and four of these studies were for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The re-profiling of antivirals is a large part of Chinese studies; by the end of April, nine studies of phase III on remdesivir were conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development of vaccines and candidates for treatment with COVID-19 was conducted. For the same purpose, several other existing antivirals for treatment with COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta, were also considered.
As of March 2020, preliminary data are available on the effectiveness of the use of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III of clinical trials is already under way in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine previously used for malaria treatment was reviewed in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for an expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Ukhani Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to a fatal outcome.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA authorized the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19. The Chinese guidelines of the 7th edition also indicate interferon, ribavirin or umifenvir as a means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-Cov-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for in vivo in-depth examination by demonstrating inhibition of SARS-Cov-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that in order to penetrate SARS-COV-2 by interacting with the ACE2 receptor, it is necessary to adopt a protein of the transmembrane protease beam 2 (TMPRSS2).
Studies on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-Cov-2 in vitro and its role in COVID-19 treatment is unclear.
Hypercytocinaemia may develop as complications in late stages of severe form of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties of hypercytocinaemia, and a small study by the National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in the recommendations for the treatment of koronavirus.
This drug has been released into the 2nd phase of the unrandomized test, which is conducted at the national level in Italy, once positive results have been obtained from patients with severe disease.
In combination with a blood serum analysis on ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract factors that are believed to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, an interleukin-6 antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies to treat the release syndrome of steroid refractory cytokines caused by another cause of CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
Transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by immune systems of patients recovering from COVID-19 to those in need is now considered as a non-vaccinating method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested in the treatment of patients from SARS, but its results have proved unconvincing.
Neutralization of the virus is the expected effect that passive therapy with antibodies can provide protection against SARS-COV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antitelelose-dependent cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using monoclonal antibodies, are at the development stage.
The use of recombinant serum serum, which consists of liquid parts of the blood of the recovering patients, can be increased and contains antibodies against the virus.
