Parliament does not support the amendment liberating Tymoshenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament has rejected the proposal to repeal a paragraph under the amendment of the Criminal Code on the basis of which the leader of the opposition, Julius Tymoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment, which would open the way for the release of a prisoner exterminator, was rejected by Members on the second reading of the proposal to mitigate penalties for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in October for concluding a allegedly unfavourable contract with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not binding, the defendant's appeal has a court to discuss in December.
Tymoshenko refers to the verdict for political revenge of the regime, and suspicion of court bias has also sparked proceedings in the West.
The proposal to exclude paragraph 365 from the criminal code on the basis of which the prime minister was sentenced to support the vote of 147 Members.
It took 226 votes to be approved.
Libyan Victory
The story of Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him is after the war.
The winner remains to be defined.
As in custom, Islamists win elections, but it is whether or not the moderation is radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied to the customary law of Sharia, and we already have an idea about it.
Libya will become a country without crime, for stealing is the hand that is cut off.
Women can forget about emancipation, possibly apostates from faith await execution and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a company consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be a order in Libya that we can't imagine and that we wouldn't want.
But our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and it probably would not fit the Libyans mentioned.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic fighters have taken thanks for the help of non-believers.
The only thing is that, from their point of view, he did not drive NATO raids by some general from America, but by Allah, whose size they celebrated in every attack they had conducted.
So when the winners are found in Libya, the west is not among them.
We took part in the shooting, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of a political ally in the dictator's person without any profit being guaranteed.
After fresh bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, Libya is not militarily occupied.
That's the problem with banishing the cruisers.
But without the occupation of the oil company, they'll have Libyan black gold as a sponge?
They may not be enough, and so the West will finally be able to boast of the unprofitable protection of human rights.
So if it doesn't get you the Sharia lawbreakers.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe came to the lookout for investors
On Tuesday, the statistical shrink was overwhelming across Europe.
Individual States published GDP data for 3Q.
The Czech economy stagnated inter-quarterly, Germany and France growing.
But today, the debt market is breaking records.
Investors are looking not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries of Europe have published preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP rose by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted the data in the second quarter, in which Germany was better off than expected (an increase of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), and France stated that it appeared in a slight decline of 0.1% (the original data were talking about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent this year in this third quarter.
However, the quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated and, according to the ČSÚ, confirmed the trend of gradually slowing economic performance growth.
The results are worse than the estimates of analysts.
Most important events:
The Czech economy grew 1.5 percent year-on-year in this third quarter, but stalled for four years.
The German economy increased by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter according to preliminary and seasonally recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2 per cent between July and September against the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The return on her 10-year bond is 28.45%.
The returns of Italian and Spanish bonds are increasing to critical limits.
Problems begin to be felt by Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
The yields for Czech 10-year bonds are below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
From Germany, votes sound that the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO.
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrated the process for 200 million
The football team has managed the most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro even thanks to the great Czech and beautiful goal Peter Jiráček won 1:0.
The Czech football, with a large portion of happiness in the second half of the year, ran a luxurious headway from the Home Office and will not be missed again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the progress game in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a great serving of happiness in the second.
Czech representation also thanks to the homemade death in the end, the great Czech and hero Jiráček won in Montenegro happily 1:0 and celebrates the process of the European championship.
Because of the precise defense of the Czech whole, the Montenegrins became under pressure in the second half.
The players of the match became Damjanovich with the Vukinic, who burned two big chances.
Even thanks to the great Peter Čech so the Czech team will not miss the European championship next year, in addition the reward of about 200 million crowns will be added to the money of the local football.
He's been playing a lot of football since the opening minutes.
Both teams just had a hard time getting involved in the combination, and it was mostly around the halfway line.
Even so, the pressure of the home football players did not come in the first half, because the Czech defense was precisely averted by long arms.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They've created a living shield.
Several hundred college students created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
In their gesture, they want to express support for their country's nuclear programme before the possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, students prayed in front of the facility and then called the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students in Iran’s Isfahan created a living shield on Tuesday around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre, where uranium is processed.
They show that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear agenda with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) noted in its recent report that Iran has apparently failed to pursue a nuclear weapon.
The possible attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is being discussed in Israel.
The students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then called the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at protecting Iran's nuclear programme as much as possible, the objective of the plant in Natanz, in which uranium is enriched, would be, according to Israeli press, in addition to the Isfahan centre.
Dining table of the obese child: breakfast and dinner of the weeds
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, with an excess of 9 percent of schoolchildren and 5 percent of children.
Obesity children, however, usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as demonstrated by current research.
Again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of the environment in which it grows and the patterns in which it is surrounded.
For example, weeds appear on tables in obese children up to half as often as in normal - weighted families.
Roasted fries were not a coincidence of more than 19 percent of adults for dinner days before a study involving an educational event called Obesity.
In fat families, too, the practice of sports is not common, which concerns the majority of the families of today’s schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children responded that their parents will find time for active movement at least once a week.
Research between 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last year's school year and was attended by almost 900 children from elementary schools throughout the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the Obesity event is not a coincidence supported by the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from 4th to 8th grade have joined the project.
The right diet and sufficient movement in the family is one of the determining factors that causes the dramatically rising number of overweight or even obese children.
"Only half of those asked, for example, stated that five times a day in the breakfast-sweak-sweak-swedding-dinner regime, which is one of the basic prerequisites of proper nutrition," one of the results of the survey is.
No breakfast, no dinner.
Experts point out that relative details are also important for healthy development, including regular family breakfast time.
In the Czech Republic, at the same time, only 23 percent of schoolchildren eat breakfast.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst thing was finding that in a tenth of the household, you don't eat at all.
Breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that unwholesome fries are more frequently consumed in families of obese children.
Almost everyone - regardless of the weight - drinks sweet lemonades (70 percent) every day.
Although she regularly sports more than 40 percent of the children concerned, less than half the result was 15 percent in their parents.
Get your menu together.
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to assemble their own dishes according to their own taste and opinion.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite dishes is a lot of flour, meat and sweet food.
"The alarm is particularly a big taste of sweet lemons," the final report states.
For lunch as the main meal, pasta won right over the poultry.
But children practically did not want shellfish at all, and there is also a low taste for fish and vegetables in the afternoon.
A Health Attraction
At the same time, research has shown that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"There is no coincidence in the audit group of survey participants who have completed the questionnaire after the end of the Obesity Education Lecture, in a number of cases there has been a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," the results of the project state.
For example, it was in sweet lemons where more children would take precedence over ordinary water.
Children also often checked the questionnaire on poultry and fish as the main food of the day and would limit sweet foods and dumplings.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, hard pros
In the opening article on how stylists are taught, I complained so little that there was a lot of it in the opening hours.
I had no idea what would follow.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, dressing up problematic characters and a seminar on how it goes on the place.
And it'll get worse.
The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "found."
This time, Principal Alenka and I were discussing (there's not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who doesn't have a perfectly consistent character.
And most of these are.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's got a boy figure with no real curves, and somebody's got a weight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften the broad shoulders, extend the neck or add the required curves.
We got tips like Jennifer Lopez's wife, i.e. bigger tits and hips and a tight waist, a figure nicely stressed and at the same time a woman doesn't dress too challenging.
For example, if the difference between a belt and a side is such that a skirt or pants really don't fit, then it pays to have at least one such piece of peace sewn up.
You will definitely not regret it, because perfect falling clothes are not to be paid.
In a dress in peace you will feel much better than in a dress that constantly moves,
The boy figure can again afford to wear clothes with abrasion, apps, embroidery or garnishing.
Of course, such information and character types are many, so I am glad that I have all the information in my head all week.
And I'm still afraid that given the homework you've been given, it's a lot to do.
For each of the courses received an assigned celebrity, which is to come up with two outfits: daily and evening.
We must consider the current appearance, fashion style of the personality and character type.
I'll "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret.
In the spirit of I am, for me personally better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained a hundred kilos (please, please, in the matter of overcrowding), or a young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut our clothes off from magazines or search the Internet and print and then print them graphically.
The moodboard, as the result is called, will then express our personal style and relationship to graphic creation.
Thinking about the graphic page styling is also important.
The Stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates so-called product pages in magazines (for specific tasks such as purse trends, coats, etc.).
This is what the stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But it's Sunday.
The Stylist must have a general overview
Three guests from the field have earned the Saturday lecture filled with information about types of characters.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
James reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a skilled stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
Variety is crucial in this case.
Thus, such a trencoat (or if you want originally trenchcoat) can be worn classically through jeans and a shirt like a coat, but you can also dress it on a bare body, wear a boat and paint it like a dress.
Or just pick up your sleeves or collars and the whole look looks different right now.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of all, I appreciated the advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work."
"Then you can begin to disturb them," said James.
So I'm finally clear why we're crushing all the lessons that we can combine, why, even if we see something else in fashion magazines.
Not to mention the show.
Thanks to photographer Ben again, I know that a stylist must have a lot more clothing options than he can take pictures of.
So at the fastion story, which will have ten sides (then ten outfits), I have to be ready to "make" at least fifteen.
And it also looks like it's working in combination with other pieces of lekda in a different way than in fact.
So we have to count on that when we're making outfits.
That image and style makes only half the success, Honza Pokorný confirmed.
All you have to do is look at Madonna, who's not exactly a miracle singer, but the image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, access to the services of stylists is rather cold.
Even familiar faces consider him useless (although I can do something, the way I look at it is secondary).
And if someone's getting a styling from us, then we're going to count on them to give us a completely different size (less) than they really do.
Then it's not just Google and see if the bulwark has written about the fact that the celebrity has stopped/were lost and so on.
Honza and Mario put on our hearts Sunday that the stylist was not enough to be fashion oriented and able to fold out.
In his work, he primarily communicates with people he dresses, and it is important to be a good psychologist.
To know how to judge people, not to encourage yourself, to stand up for yourself.
"When a manager orders you to clean up her wardrobe and fill it with nice pieces, you can't throw out the whole closet and say, for God's sake, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things to commend and recommend what they can be worn for," says Mario.
He also showed us specifically what must contain the so-called "placent" or a bag on the square.
It's the one you fasten around the waist and you have all the propriets you need.
In addition to clear things such as scissors, hair rollers or closing pins, there are also nylon thread (with which a stylist helps to take pictures of products such as purses or hats), special clips that we put on in the back of clothing, if it is larger (the pin or other clamps are not acceptable, they would destroy clothing), or stitch.
In order not to listen, but also to try something, we learned how to bend our shoes properly.
Even when taking pictures in an atelier where the surface is flat, the sole could be damaged, especially outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We can't even touch our shoes with scissors without accidentally damaging ourselves.
So you really need skill.
Mario pleased me when he commended my creation without reservation.
The skill mentioned is not really a friend of mine.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard about the second weekend course.
It's beginning to become more and more clear to me that taking a professional style course really isn't a walk with a pink set, let anyone think who wants what they want.
In Need for Speed: The Run runs across America.
Reviews
Initially carefree driving is turning a series of useless lyjdish errors into a routine morning trip to the shift.
Although the ambition has been largely fulfilled, it is not valid when no one clearly wanted to do anything else.
A new work with the subtitle The Run was awakened before the release of high expectations.
He promised that the summer racing series Need for Speed would once again move a piece in a new direction and from playable shows appeared as a game that in the genre of action racing would not have to be just a number.
We were also curious as to how the passages would fall into place, where the main hero would get out of the car and run his way.
As with the NFS series, however, many are quite different in the result than we expected.
They are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole thing drags down a few unnecessary mistakes that have appeared in the series for more than a few years.
So it's actually not a mistake, but rather an incomprehensible lazyness of developers.
Adventure begins very well.
You are listed in a story whose main hero Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution is offered participation in an illegal race across America.
You will be seated behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to arrive first in New York.
The idea brings with it a few interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then into more than 50 races.
It follows that each race is on another track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
Man doesn't feel like he's offering the same thing all the time.
Some of the environments are also very nice to see, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's not a sacrilege.
But driving across deserts, autumn landscapes or high in snowy mountains seems visibly pleasant.
In addition, races have been seasoned with some unusual element from time to time.
In the desert, for example, you get involved in a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you must be careful not to be put to sleep by an avalanche.
Besides, there's quite a lot of competition going on behind them.
There's only a few of them, but that's enough.
For a while you are trying to prevent the required number of opponents (in fact a classic race), then you are catching up on time (classical match with feet) and then a duel with a single opponent awaits you.
Even from time to time, the police are also involved, which continues to make all your efforts more uncomfortable.
New arrivals are out of the car.
It's more of an interactive animation where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help him by right clicking the right buttons at the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that these passages are much less in the game than you would expect (especially perhaps even three).
In the result, however, it is for the benefit of the matter, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying, and in the context of the above, it is in line with the elements that enhance the game.
The vehicle model is in the tracks of the previous parts.
This means that it is no longer a thing to say nowadays, but it cannot be said that it is a resistance.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But the more well-known racing of the driving model here still fits quite well, although we could find better for the competition.
Until then, everything is in perfect order.
But problems are starting to emerge after a while.
Unlike the model of the ride, it is no longer a good model of collision.
We do not expect this type of game to count complex deformities and collisions, but when you have virtually no idea of how your car will behave before any impact on any object, then it is probably not quite all right.
Typically, when driving or switching cars in normal traffic, you can only gently lick each other, but sometimes in almost identical situations your car will end up in wild pirouettes.
Or even assault.
Thanks to the reboot system, it doesn't really bother you, but it will make you nervous.
The restarts are solved so that if you crash or go far off the line, the game throws you back on the last catch point on the line.
Only five restarts are available in each race.
If you exhaust them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it's more of a help if something doesn't work out that you can't rely on them explicitly.
Sometimes, though, the reboots won't help, they'll have to learn the section of the memory race.
The big incompetence of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be run in a specific way, otherwise you will not fit into them in a short time.
Another time you will meet the "civil" cars at a given location in the same configuration, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or one minute later.
Especially in situations where you can see how between the two opposite cars the opponent will easily pass before you, while when you get there, there are already cars in such a position that you have to ride or slow them down.
It doesn't matter when you get to them because it's "calculated" so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
The rivals have another advantage.
Throughout the game, you will encounter several places where, no matter the time, the same opponent will always pass in the same place.
Most of it hits the end of the game on the long bridge where you're heading in the opposite direction.
There must be an adversarial in front of you, obviously, at any cost.
When it comes to you, it makes it worse for you to have an overview of the opposite cars, so at first, you're going to spread a few times.
You can understand the intention to make the game more intense and adrenaline-intensive, but the execution is so obvious that it will surely defuse you quickly.
And it's a shame, because despite a simple driving model, it's fun and places so much action that sometimes you don't literally follow where everything flies.
And it really doesn't matter whether the concept of 50 unique races, the sort of races, the boredom doesn't have a chance, or anything else.
The unconventional idea is to switch cars during races.
You have to keep an eye on the petrol pumps by the road, because you can change the car there, even though in the vast majority of cases you get enough with what you just have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sportsmen are suitable for urban areas, strong American storms on straight highways and exotic supersports for technical rides, such as by clicking mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand and fashion challenges, which are races in individual locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points to your profile, which is common to challenges and story.
In order to obtain a higher level of driver, different objects are unlocking: starting cars and ending with backgrounds for the profile.
It is also connected again with the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares your results with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the other hard to understand is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car, you will reach the subway tunnel (the building) where you drive it in the dark after the tracks (the building).
On the tachometer, you have numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (building) and in the back of the subway set, and you are uncompromisingly scrapped.
In the newsroom, we're going to have a discussion for a few more days about whether no one really thought a bit about what we're doing, or whether the authors think we're really that big a jerk.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
It will freeze so that in some more remarkable moments, the filming is falling, and in some cases it is tragic.
However, this applies mainly to storms with more participants, where smooth shooting would no longer be valid for you.
The sound page is fine and soundtrack is a question of taste.
In an effort to enjoy the widest possible scale of the younger audience there was a soundtrack from the category "every dog another village", but it can be assumed that due to listening to the music the game will probably not be bought by anyone.
Total impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so much distraught.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary errors, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of the NFS in several years.
But that's how the game works.
I'm sure the fun is fine, but prepare to see that your mistakes will be shaken in the eyes by the force of the airport reflectors.

Ambassador to the EU Vice-President:
Czechs have the reputation of negativists and eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has seriously violated the balance between the individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to settle down, calm down and before all players get used to their new roles," began her lecture at the Faculty of Law, Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová.
As much as she takes her motto "Absolutely and openly about Europe" seriously, she showed in the first part of her lecture, when she managed to describe the various EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that she could envy a number of speakers from the UK Law School.
Vicenová also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, there was a criticism that he was unspeakable that he was a grey official, that he could not play any role, and I must say that everyone was breathed, that the role was served perfectly."
"He is a man who can listen to twenty-seven Member States, communicate perfectly with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? Which phone number should I call?", i.e. as a significant step towards unification and greater readability of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from cheese.
Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Council has lived, lived and lived in the near future.
The Czech Presidency called it a success.
The Czechs solved the coming financial crisis, solved the gas crisis, or organised a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The collapse of the government at this time then marked the great negativity, which greatly damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is very busy at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador, "the fact of the frmole" was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis that is being resolved to this day.
Moreover, the new Union budget of seven years is still to be approved, which is very complicated because of the current economic situation.
The budget will be short and cost-effective, which sectors will get the advantage that countries will be supported more and less, all on the agenda of the next negotiations.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "About Europe in a clear way".
"I really don't like ugly shortcuts, strange words, a joke that no one understands.
How can a citizen understand that in Brussels they do not really invent curved or round cucumbers, bananas in various sizes, or that someone really has to ban us cheeses."
He also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
We have a multi-speed Europe ahead of us.
According to the ambassador, Czechs have the reputation of Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than the positive side of things.
Moreover, she is sorry for the low Czech representation in European institutions.
She blames many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she raised the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me that when Polak and Hungary come to me and the Slovak approaches, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are you meeting there, what is your Visegrad Four?"
In the future, according to Vicenová, the Union is looking forward to new tough rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
As a very real one, he perceives the concept of a double-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, rather than a new "European Federation."
"We have the countries of the euro area and countries outside the euro area."
"We've got Schengen space, we've already got the institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it has been said that only countries who want to cooperate and those who don't want to stand by."
"These institutes will be more and it will be a strong two-speed Europe," says Vicenová.
In this respect, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle that all topics affecting the whole Union should be discussed between all Member States, not just between the euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM Innovator Begins Second Century of His Existence
If someone was looking for a word that would most accurately express IBM's strategy, it would probably be "longevity".
For the general public IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, and yet it has been established for a hundred years.
The foundation of this longevity was laid by the first head of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already pointed out that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His password "Think!" became a print around which the life of the future giant will unfold (and also the name of an internal magazine that started in IBM in 1935).
It was also the basis of Watson's carefully built corporate culture.
"For us, IBM means a long-term thinking of a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for hundreds of years because she remained faithful to her basic values and was not afraid to change everything else around her.
This allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that we will be able to achieve even more in the second century," Samuel J. Palmisano noted on his anniversary.
Processed system
Watson, in the 1930s, had access to care for his employees in the same way as the business owner Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people, as one of the first American employees, had paid vacations, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a developed system to reward the best inventors and businessmen.
The same is true of IBM's long-term relationship with the customer.
From the start, the company has been brilliant in the exploitation of talent - as one of the first world companies to abolish any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana, headed by IBM next year, will be replaced by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
It has been operating in IBM for 30 years, and it is still the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been making so-called caves, online brainstormings in recent years, with many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder there's enough ideas - almost half a million people work at the company.
An institution with a good name
A position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technological firm," Professor Harvard Business School told Economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems for the use of technology," said George Colony of the consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, the difference between entering the market and creating a market is the difference.
IBM - or "Great Blue", as its logo in the United States gives her a family name - has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a hundred years.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
They hold the most patents from all American technology companies, and five of its employees won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include ATM, payment card, financial swap, bar code or diskette.
IBM was about $220 billion this year, becoming the second largest technology company according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when Microsoft was first introduced since 1996.
Front view
Not all products and innovations hit customers and times - IBM, for example, failed to place a bet on its own OS/2 operating system, on-line Prodigy or IBM PCjr.
"If your business is built on moving forward, you cannot emotionally cling to the past," notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms - and if they don't work, then leave them.
Unlike a competitive Microsoft, which basically falls on Windows's operating system.
Perspective technology
In IBM markets, services are the largest, after about a fifth of them are made up of software and hardware.
Even in 1990, he was the strongest hardware representative with more than half a share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profitable assets worth $15 billion, during which time it has invested $58 billion to purchase speculative technologies.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the world’s first financial crisis was overtaken.
IBM is acting according to the reference of its first Chief Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the great economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is undergoing a current crisis that has not been affected.
IBM stock prices have increased by 120 percent rocket since the beginning of 2008, and the company’s net profit is steadily rising.
IBM's corporate password is to change everything, just not its values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will cope with it.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flights
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, originally named Computer Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took over until 1924 - originally it was a brand used for branches of the company in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later IBM gave a merger to four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They owned technologies such as famous "tips," which means hours recording employees coming and going.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the Supervisory Board until 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson's competition manager to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of IBM - Watson’s ideas, an insurmountable corporate culture and identity is built.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business machinery - from meat slicers and cheese to cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson’s leadership, it doubled its turnover to nine million dollars, and the extensive expansion of the company into all worlds began.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that nearly 40 years later, his son, Thomas Watson Junior, replaced him in the boss chair.
Under his leadership IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
During the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA to fly to space - to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous man-to-moon years.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed its first computer family - a series of IBM System/360.
A classic "touch" that established the computer standard at the time, with the name IBM 5150 came to market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold computer production to Lenovo, on the other hand, bought a consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and started to give full advice and high added value services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off in the last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, the Smarter Planet.
Its aim is to use technologies wisely in the previously unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example in transport or city management.
For the area of trade, IBM recently introduced a platform "Smarter Commerce", which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
She founded her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, besides IBM, the Czech Republic also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Centre is located in Prague and there is also a research team of the world level dealing with voice recognition.
Speedy about a cheating husband:
Iveta, leave that donkey alone, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Speeder (53) said the end!
After her husband Joseph Richtara (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartosha (45), but also the lover, Darina hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now it is no longer convenient to wait, and clear rules have been laid down in the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," said Speeder.
When Darina Richtářová gave asylum to Bartoše in her home in the summer, she evidently did not give up on how her marriage would end.
Although Iveta had moved away after 30 days from the Romans, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even admitted publicly that he loved her.
During the course of time, Darina gave up her relationship with her husband, making peace, and now she even gave him good - bye forever.
Fishermen don't care who his wife sleeps with.
If he and Bartosh broke up just once, his wife's open arms won't be waiting for him at home.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will drive him out."
"But he will live to live to him not as my beloved, lost old donkey, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," Rýchtárová said, with the fact that she has already drifted away from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
Joseph's having Darina shut his back door so far, that's okay.
"I respect the decision of my wife."
"I'm going to be with Yvette, and I'm not going to change it."
"The wife set up a paper marriage, and I respect it."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, shopping."
"Darina and I have a normal conversation, except that we don't share the bed together," said Lightning Quicktár.
If Rikhtára also found new love, she won't be able to defend herself.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with, and if he has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and I take all the responsibility," Josef concluded.
The worst women's habits: do they concern you?
When you ask men if they can name any typical female vices, they usually all fall out of the sleeve at once.
Dear women, will you meet in the following lines, where there are several female traits that can perfectly understand men's blood in their veins?
Shopping
Does your other half bother you that you're addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like to shop and shop in discounts?
Then, in your case, you can talk about shopping as a habit.
Some women realize that they should at least reduce their shopping passion.
But tell me, who would resist just walking around in the clothes business, looking for well-fallen ends, and then try them all (usually in different color performances) in the booth?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can literally become a finished hell.
Just remember how many times you've told your family to wait for you outside the front door...
Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I too fat?"
"Do I need to lose at least five kilos? Should I start practicing?"
"Do you even like me?"
Don't these sentences remind you of anything?
Isn't it?
Then you belong to those women who are obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their looks.
The stronger sex also coincides with the increasing frequency of this complaint, making women more annoying.
Order and purity first
It's like an endless run.
Wash windows, suction, carpeting, dusting, scrubbing baths - at least twice a week.
You blame your partner for sticking his dirty foot to the clean floor, to the children, that they were dirty with a scrubbed sink and covered with a glass living wall, with whose polishing you have done so much work?
In case you are suffering from this “distortion”, try to realize that nothing has to be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should definitely not stand within the family in the first place.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can endanger your relationships and family tranquillity.
Scraping
"You used sweatpants throw in the basket."
"You're gonna wear those old socks tomorrow too?"
"The wet wipes don't belong on the ground."
If you do so several times a day, know that you can safely turn it.
Of course, you don't mean any harm, but you want to make sure everything's okay.
Maybe if the men knew, the women wouldn't have to kick as much as they do...
Conspiracy, gossip
For some women there are also gossips, gossips, and insults and fellowships against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us will let a little harmless gossip or slander out there.
Hands on your heart, he's got it for all the women.
However, the gossips of the most rough grains, which they like and often gossip, may be offensive to everyone and are especially dangerous for their surroundings - mainly within the women's working group - are particularly dangerous.
Jágra and Voráček helped assist to win Philadelphia
Hockey Attacker Jaromír Jágr participated in Monday's NHL game by two assistants to the victory of Philadelphia 5:3 on the ice of Carolina and is again at the head of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
From the point of view of the nine - year - old star, Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was awarded the best game player.
Two assistants in the match were recorded by Jagra's teammate Jakub Voráček.
After the game, the Jag told overseas journalists that Giroux had foretold a big evening.
"Before the game, I told him he'd give a hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that way," explains Jagr, after whose action Giroux scored the first Flyers shot.
A little while later, the second team hit was a Czech lead.
Voreček fought behind the goal of Hurricanes wheel and presented it between circles scoring Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first break he reduced in weakening domestic player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to Flyers.
Specifically, Giroux.
After working with Jágre, he scored a third goal, and then his shot ran into Wayne Simmons' fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean to say that he is the best player in the league, but he certainly belongs among the best three," said Jagr of his centre.
"I never thought I'd play hockey like him at the end of my career."
"I'm happy about it."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates have tried to play me, now it's turning," Jagr added.
Carolina's still making the game a drama, Tuoma Ruutua goal, and again Dwyer, who made it out of the shooting, got in the same way as one goal.
Another complication, however, did not allow Matt Read, who completed the count of two to one.
"He's a great hit in our Pronger band."
"I hit the wheel, I picked up the speed and (Read) went to the more distant pole."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked," he described the last goal of the game from his point of view as Voráček.
Philadelphia won the East Conference.
Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček did not win a match against Buffalo, in the second third he resigned for injuries in the upper body.
The Candiens next to the experienced beak lost two-stranded guides and lost after the penalty shoot-out 2:3.
One of their raids didn't change Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach, rather than the lost points, was cold with a large part of the back row, with only five defenses winning.
"It's bad."
"We only played games with one seasoned player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"The trimmings in exchange were falling on us, and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game more, move the puck out of our belt."
In this we had gaps," added one of P.K. Subban's defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed 30 interventions to Winnipeg to win 5:2 over Tampou Bay.
Five different shooters split up over the Jets goals, which interrupted the five-point series of losses.
How Tour Prices Were Developing Since 1989
By 1989 only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourism.
Travel agencies at the time sold only trips to the countries of the Socialist bloc in a fragile majority, since travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists so traveled on vacation to the sea to the NDR (Germany Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi at Crimea near the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when the possibility of travel to Yugoslavia was also possible, but the Yugoslav regime then joined the West and the journeys of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the social era was that it was not possible for citizens of the Socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovakians) to travel individually even in socialist countries.
If the citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation from this country, otherwise it was not possible to make an individual journey.
Travel agencies at the time also offered trips to the West, but there was a need to stand up overnight with a sleeping bag or to have a "good acquaintance" in the travel agency.
Even so, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange pledge, which was a condition for the journey to the West, was not made by "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a free currency without a foreign exchange commitment, so it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) on the way to the West.
Far more often, however, the Czechs spent vacations in the country, which resulted in a large number of chats and cottages that the Czechs have acquired and this habit is still alive.
The journey of the Czechs has thus been a real revolution since 1989.
While the NDR or Bulgaria vacation in 1989 was our maximum, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations abroad in countries around the world.
The enormous paradox that we are not aware of today is that it was not possible for us to travel freely to the most popular country in the present time, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia, until 1989.
Immediately in the late 1990s, a visa waiver took place in neighbouring Western European countries, launching a huge wave of short-term visits mainly to Austria's Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovakians couldn't get enough to travel to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look at it for a while.
For example, in Paris Czech tours were burned in tents in parks, since our income back then did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a guest house.
The typical feature of travelling Czechs was driving their own food, can, salami, etc., to be spared.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely exchangeable Czech crown, which finally allowed our tourists to buy the Western currency freely after many decades.
However, our living standards and average salaries have risen, which emerged around 1997 at another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have been regularly preparing trips with charter air connections since 1997, thus allowing air tours to offer numerous discounts compared to the past to an incredible discount.
By the late 1990s, Czech visa-free contact had practically been in all developed countries of the world, except the United States, which continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-voluntary travel occurred in 2000 when, due to considerable demand, the Czech Republic received the historic first direct charter flight to exoticism, it was to Thailand.
From this year every year they fly direct charters with Czech tourists to warm distant countries, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries will now visit around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. visa for Czech tourists was cancelled and our country has definitely become one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) for the first time in their history, spending more than 15 thousand CZK per person on a foreign holiday, including on-site costs.
The General Assembly is about to find the President, but again, it's dangerous.
For almost five months, Czech football without the president is threatened that the successor to Ivan Hask at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR) will not be known after another extraordinary general assembly, which will take place in Nymburka on Thursday.
There is still no agreement on which electoral order will proceed.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Interest in leading Czech football have Jindrich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hashek resigned in June and, on his departure, urged his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in the post-Hashko era, football slipped back to the trails between the two federal chambers, which could not match on a joint candidate.
This proved to be true on September 16th, when the new President was to be elected.
The delegates of the general meeting to the National House in Prague in Smíchov sat in vain, as the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just a way of choosing.
Nor did it come to pass who has the right to vote at the assembly - whether only the statutory representatives, or also the officers of the mandate, have the power to vote.
At this single point, there has been a partial agreement since then, and the recommendation of the Constitution for the State and the law that representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
However, disputes still prevail over the electoral order.
He did not bring too much clarity into the situation by the executive committee, which, at its meetings, no longer proper or extraordinary, essentially decides anything else.
The view of the choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
Question is: how do we proceed in round 3 to eliminate the possibility of a heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of FAČR Dušan Svoboda, who represented professional football in the leadership of the association.
According to the designs of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate will win, who will have more percentage support in the chamber than he is running for.
Morava is allegedly willing to take a concession to win a candidate who gains a higher sum of the percentage of the votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side advocates a condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds advantage in this percentage of the score.
"But then it would make no sense to the two previous rounds, it would totally deny the two-room concept," he understands the objections of the Moravian side of Freedom, according to which it would be best not to move and vote according to the statutes in force.
Although Tomáš Paclík agrees with this surprisingly, it is estimated that all the candidates in the election regulations are most suitable for Pelt.
"I wish it was elected according to the statutes."
"To avoid making up any general nonsense as in the previous general meeting," said the owner, Victoria Plzen, who was running for the first time and, in his comments, was chiefly against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, the new President will be known and believes that candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All passions will calm today's possible national team move to the European championship."
"Football will once again be on a happy wave, it will be more willing to cooperate," says the Jablonecian official, who has the greatest experience in managing football both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more resilient.
"I hope it's a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very messy."
"It is not between Czech and Moravian people, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations on purpose."
"This could cause the general crowd to be blocked again."
"I hope, however, that common sense prevails," Rachl said.
There's not much time left for the agreement on all sides.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if football generality would be complete in the match.
The special flight in which they were to travel to Podgorica, among other things, Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kuchera and Rajchl, from Prague, did not leave because of the technical disturbance in the morning and looked for an alternative option to transport part of the executive committee to the point of the barzaj vveta.
Finally, there may be a decisive ministerial meeting, which may occur on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Body Education Josef Dobeš would like to bring divided parties within the strongest sports association in the country to an agreement.
There is a lot in the game: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also a prepared general crowd of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the president because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If football chief Tomáš Paclík had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general assembly, who would have met all his ideas about the new Chairman of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not have applied for the highest office.
"If a quality adept exists, I fight for it, and I don't go to the election."
"But in the current situation no one has managed to find one," said CTC Paclik.
To fight Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchlík's wife Paclík's motivation to try to prevent Pelt's alleged favorite election on the way to the head of FAČR.
Paclík also emphasises that, in the event of his victory, he would only last for the presidency until 2013, when there is a proper general crowd on the programme.
In his function he would like to see an experienced and top-notch manager who is not too attached to football.
"With some people who would come to mind, I spoke."
"It was crazy for me when some people said that right now they don't even want to identify themselves with Czech football."
"That's the view I'd like to change," he said.
Paclík said that Pelt’s connection with the president of the Plzeň Regional Football Union, Roman Berbre, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, has the ability to influence the voting of delegates at the general assembly.
It is so unacceptable for Paclik to stand in the presidency.
"If he won, the current condition is preserved and nothing would move forward in football."
"In combination with Berbra's support, which is a good businessman, this football would not be more beneficial," Paclik said.
It also points out that Pelt's name sounded in the wiretaps years ago during an investigation into a corruption affair, from which Pelt came out without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring."
"And what would we look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who is also looking at his earlier statement that "he would sell the Plzeň club if Pelta became president".
However, if Paclik triumphed in the Thursday election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
In the same way, another Richl candidate, who Paclik supported in front of the glowing general crowd, who ended up in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's got great powers."
"I could imagine him as head of the team."
"But the executives couldn't run the association."
"I also don't put my nose where I can't do it," Paclik said, who in September raised much attention by standing behind the appeal of the panel of referees led by Human Macella, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclik claims he'd be tripping to run an association.
He refers to his ability to manage private companies, and since last summer, Pilsen has also been in charge, which, with his support in May, celebrated the premiere league triumph.
"I have the strength to make a difference in the football environment to contribute to his particular cultivation."
"To limit the influence of some interest groups, which may tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals commission, which goes all the way to disgusting situations," Paclik said, who does not touch his antipathies, for example, with the Spartan boss Daniel Křetinski.
He would also consider a priority to be a tightening of FAČR relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby for more money from lottery taxes for political peaks.
"It's one of the key things the new president should do."
"If there is a gambling tax, as the political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they have to say where the money goes," he noted.
As a burden, Paclík does not take his link with the Plzeň club, although he claims himself that the President of FAČR should be "superstantial".
Pelta is back with Jablonce, Rajchl with Prague Duklo.
"It's not perfect."
"I don't see the point in turning my stock into someone's covert in the Flesh Club and in a year and a half," Paclik said.
Pelta promised new FAČR sites that would rule out an electoral pat
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that, if elected, the FACR would have new provisions that would definitely rule out disputes over the electoral rules in the future.
The Jablonec Officer is an optimist before the Thursday meeting in Nymburce and believes that the election fight will significantly dampen today's possible success of the football team.
Pelta vowed to focus on the representation and acquisition of finance before the failed election of September.
He decided to go at the last minute in the election before the last general meeting, so a two-month delay could be appropriate for him to defend and present his ideas about football management in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time for the association to lead someone," he thinks, which is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, but which has worked for many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the union.
That is why he thinks he has enough experience to drive Czech football.
He believes that the euphoria that prevailed in the reign of Ivan Hask is behind the current election problems.
"Unfortunately, regulations were approved for the Red General Assembly, which were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they did not accept the various interpretations, we had the President since September," Pelt warned.
In fact, the reworking of the most important document of the civil society has been promoted as a branch to delegates.
"If I become president, I'll take it as a personal task and I'm willing to take personal responsibility if that doesn't work."
"It's a fundamental thing that we can't be without," Pelt says.
He says he's still trying not to define himself against his rivals.
He had previously avisited that he could imagine working with Jindrich Reichl, whom he recognises for his legal education, and well knows that his opponent would be his first vice president.
He didn't attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, which, on the contrary, left no thread on Pelt.
"In football, he's been moving for over a year, he's had some success."
"But his attacks were disrespectful and many people in a way jumped the election campaign."
"Therefore a number of them now doubt his true character," Pelt said at the opponent's address, which he said remained faithful to the proclamations, which he announced in September.
His strongest weapon, according to him, is the knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the representation.
It should be an exposé box of football.
"And I would also try to end all affairs starting with the cause of the Bohemians or the sound of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would then go to negotiations with the private and state sectors to secure enough money for the whole football," the CHT said a 16-year-old candidate two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his arrival at the head of football would not mean any staff cleaning.
"I should first introduce myself to the fullness of the individual employees," he said to Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness from long-term turmoil.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the general crowd, they believe that on Thursday the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If the only issue is how he's going to vote in the third round, we can get through it."
"The football needs credibility, and it is only by having its leader back at last," Pelta remains an optimist two days before the possible decisive day of his functionary career.
Rajchl promises that under him FACR would start to work hard
If the new President of the Czech Republic's Football Association was elected to the Thursday General Assembly by the current Vice-President Jindřich Reichl, many people in the Association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that if he chooses, he will work hard.
He wants to introduce systemic changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for each football area.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemian cause, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work initiated by previous President Ivan Hasek.
"As president, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football after youth."
"I do not say that I would do everything myself," Richl said in an interview for the Czech Republic.
"I am a team player, and I want to share competences in the executive committee so that each member will be dedicated to certain areas."
"And I'm going to be handing out hard tasks to move football forward in each of these segments."
"Many people would probably not be happy because it would start working really hard and not just criticising the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he was thinking about not running again.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people who will constantly throw sticks at my feet and question every step of me," he explained.
"A lot of people told me I couldn't give up because others would give up."
"This is a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He also said he's motivated by the continued work he started with Haske.
"In the last two years, there's been a lot of work going on, and I don't want to throw it away."
"There are processes in place that will not be heard in a few years' time, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said with concern that if the election of another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the union situation could return to The Hague.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelta can do."
"There are mostly people behind him who would do football so that he'd be just for the chosen ones."
"I can count on a lot of things, but certainly not the fact that I'm taking someone away."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just an election," Rajchl noted.
He also refutes the claim that he would only be the Czech President.
"Although some people try to argue otherwise, I intend to do the most for Morava."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into Czech and Moravian parts whose winners would go to the first league."
"There would not be such a current situation where there are only three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
As the leader of the Pilsen Club Tomáš Paclík also took part in the fight for the President, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of election.
"I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its Vice-President and sees that there are clear successes behind me," Richl said, who considers his achievements to be saving tens of millions of crowns on unfavourable contracts, contracting television contracts and negotiations on lottery law.
On the contrary, he takes as his accomplice the fact that the tie does not pull a rope.
While declaring Pelt "disqualified from returning to the Czech football of confidence", the second of Paclík's rivals considers him a strong candidate who has a football offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If he was elected, he would have continued in those things that Ivan Hashek had started here and would not have fundamentally changed the staffing of the committees."
"He wouldn't want to squander it in his favor," says Rivaly Reichl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to Blue
Julia Stanek
Bustaway from Ufona's point of view, luxury swimming pool in Budapest: The traveler of Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after sightseeing cities or travelling let his tired feet rest in thermal baths.
The book will show you where wellness is most beautiful by water.
When Iris Meder appeared in the past one-and-a-half-year discovery journeys, her swimsuits could not be missing in her luggage.
Lying on the water, looking up at the height of the artisticly shaped domes, swimming across from marble trails (a small naked boy, a child (with wings)) who waited for her at the edge of the pool and admired carefully restored secession fairs.
If she liked a swimming pool, she carried it into her notebook in the blink of an eye with remarkable details about the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been examined in this way by the history of Meder architecture and are now represented in its published book "Badefreuden (Joy of Bathing)": People's Sailing in Munich, the historic palace of Swarzwald, "The hard core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "The road behind the most unusual spas in Central Europe": Next to Germany, Austria and Switzerland visited localities in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old Germany is a real enthusiast of floating culture.
With sport, it doesn't go too far, says Meder - only in water is it something else.
The only thing to anger is that fans must be satisfied with blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while jockeys for health can breathe in the snorkeling smell or listen to the cheerful birding in the park.
"One day I asked why the swimming pools must always be so ugly," said Vienna living Mrs. Meder.
"That's how I started gathering nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Snoring in the diving pool and the etheric oils for sauna - the factor of comfort is therefore so great that it concerns all senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the boats can be a true trap for the eyes: "A man has a water level in the baths."
"But it's transparent, on the other hand, but it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is optically redoubled: high klanba, wide tiles, jump boards.
The "Badefreuden (Joys of Bathing)" little-formed picture notebook provides 190 pages of everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historic wellnes oasis - arouses but above all the desire to jump into the blue.
Amazing specimens were discovered by Mrs. Meder's collector during her search in Hungary.
Alongside beautiful healing spas, like 100 years old Széchenyi spas in Budapest, they found water with nitrogen content in the original karst cavern (the cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath whose swimming pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a building shaped like a bottle (Városi Termalfürdö in Jásberéna).
A beautiful view of this is offered by many heated swimming pools under the wide sky in Switzerland and Austria. While a man has a curysh swimming pool in the city’s eyes, a snow covered by Arlberg can be seen in the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton’s snow covered by Arlberg – and: In steam baths there is a window from which you can watch the movement on ski slopes.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool is expected by spa guests in Längenfeld: Aquapark Ötztal looks like an ufo that has just landed in the Alps.
From three ups and ups in winter, steam rises while in the background of Mount Ötztal it goes to heaven.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not every swimming pool picked up Mrs. Meder's scent of chlorine in the flu.
Many thermal baths are felt after the sulphur, in spa Arpad in Hungary Bekessab it smells like warm oil to the extent that one can hardly believe that he has gotten into a healing bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal water containing alkaline hydrogen carbonates, which is almost black and whose sediments are found on the skin as soon as only a person slips into the pool - a somewhat special experience of wellness.
However, Iris Meder was disappointed in one place: when she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate spa Luhačovice, she came across a closed terrain.
In 1902 architect Dusan Jurkovic proposed baths were closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the falling windows of the red-and-white-yellow secession building, she saw how the weed between the tiles was likely to grow.
On the other hand, they stood up at a magic fair in Schwarzwald: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wilbad.
These spas are already in three phases of construction; one can discover not only the novel elements that come from the time of its creation in 1844, but also the Maura Hall in Alhambra style, which was joined around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation of 1995 Palais Thermal is the popular spa spot of the acquaintance of Mrs Iris Meder’s swimming pools, not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"It is already some kind of power to connect such diverse building structures into such a beautiful complex," said Mrs. Meder.
At such a palace there's probably a borderline matter sinking into the thermal pool.
Agrarian Speculation
Deutsche Bank lets check commodity trading
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave his trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to information, SPIEGEL-ONLINE commissioned Josef Ackermann to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
Then, in January, the head of the company wants to draw the consequences.
Hamburg -
It is clear to the federal citizens: 84% of Germans consider one study to be unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of the respondents even require Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to come out of this business because the problems of the poorest world are deepening.
This is the result of a Forsa survey from the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study builds on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
It shows the author Harald Schumann that betting on global commodity exchanges is pushing prices up and banks are therefore part of the world's hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically directed against the chief of Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann, although also large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Initially, commodity bets were meant to ensure that traders were secure against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that the participants in the capital market with interest in high-risk trade have withdrawn from supply and demand - and profited at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, he responded to Ackermann’s criticism: He promised to check the prizes and said that no trade "is worth not having the good reputation of Deutsche Bank placed at stake".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the International Working Group controls the foodwatch-Report prizes.
By the end of the year the check is to be closed and the results will then be presented to Deutsche Bank - along with the recommendation on how to load it.
In the end of January, the bank’s representatives would like to know what the consequences are.
At the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even total rejection.
Ackermann is working with his own help on his image.
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but strengthened his criticism of the financial sector at the same time: "The betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastic, how it is damaging to the general welfare of the bank today."
May Ackermann, as the highest banking lobbyist, be worthy of duty.
"Deutsche Bank must delete from its portfolio all items in which money is used for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"It's a shame if Mr. Ackermann is hungry for people who suffer or Deutsche Bank's reputation."
Ackermann’s view appears at first sight as surprising, but it is clear that the company’s boss would like to leave a perfect picture several months before he left the office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Head of Board would not go to the Supervisory Board otherwise than planned.
By turning away from the disputed agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And the possible losses don't have to be taken care of - he should deal with it eventually by his successor.
Any other investment in raw materials would be declared
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have been involved in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which 1001 people were questioned by the Forsa Institute on 7 and 8 November.
Just 11 percent of all people say that Deutsche Bank is legitimate in offering investments that are linked to the food price bets.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they found out that their bank was involved in such transactions: each other would have disclosed all the investments in which the money flows to speculation with raw materials as a result of the survey.
43 percent would warn a known bank to do so, 49 percent said that they were thinking about clearing their account and moving to another institution.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
Moved Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion from the World Show in Brussels 1958 won prizes, became a Museum in Vienna, remained empty and released.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition house.
When it climbs for modern post-war architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials, which are typical of belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is an excellent and famous example.
Schwanzer's pavilion was then received by Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and resilient structure of steel and glass.
The building is still regarded as a milestone in the current architecture.
He celebrated the architect by building an Austrian pavilion for the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-war BMW plus key built by the secondary building in Munich, it was internationally celebrated in 1973.
As a temporary exhibition building designed by pavilion after the world exhibition, it was located in Schweizer Garten near the Vienna Südbahnhof (South Station), reconstructed and opened in 1962 by the Museum of the 20th Century - it was called "The House of the 20th Century".
But suitable for the museum building was neither spatial nor technical - there were no walls for hanging artistic exhibits, no air-conditioning.
Still, it was used until the contemporary art reached a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has chatted more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz pavilon reconstructed, now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as the Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday night, the Belvedere Museum will open, to which the palace belongs, the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a promoted art historian with a prominent career, i.e. in the youth of a scavengerfisher, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as the founder of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, has strongly reconstructed politicians and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsorship money and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, works by sculptor Fritz Zruby with the same name foundation should be exhibited, a coffee shop and a bookstore should be created, and an office building must be built to do so.
Strict surveillance, low budget.
Krischanitz was then an ideal occupation to be carried out.
Not only did he emotionally reconstruct and expand the secession buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzer at the Technical University Vienna and the pavilion was for him "an immeasurably important place", at which he "almost every weekend" looked at the exhibitions.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which at its transfer to Vienna and the change of use lost on its generosity and ease.
During the reconstruction, there were far bigger problems: The building was a "catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
Windows profiles of glass facades were replaced, glass fibers reinforced with insulation glass and glass roof replaced with special safety glass.
Cold steel bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been preserved.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, a running lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, leading to the entrance of the bridge - almost a new building, but still a reputable Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door remained preserved, the building is carved in an old anticorrosive red color tone.
And the kinosal is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all for the strict supervision of the memorial office and the low budget.
"Frequently, material must have been found which is good and cheap and also liked the memorial office," Krischanitz says, pointing to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
The difficult thing was with the pavilion, "which came here from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, the typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
It's the kind of architecture that stands "always in the wrong place" and yet "being the right self-esteem".
In this case, however, the 21st-century House is not in a bad place, as there was a urban happy coincidence: In the area around Schweizer Garten a completely new design "City quarter at Main Station" with office and residential houses.
And perhaps there will be another happy occasion: House of the 21st century could receive support from another Krischanitza building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as they are heard, is already dealing with the town of the neighbourhood in Schweizer Garten.
The track plans a million-dollar package for the winter crisis
The track issued a crisis plan to prevent train crashes during the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against the winter caused by train accidents and delays, Deutsche Bahn issues more than 70 million euros in newspapers this year, according to a report.
The newspaper "Bild" brought a preliminary report calling back on the internal business plan that it is estimated to account for a total of around 300 million euros by 2015.
It is said that better use of trains and rail networks should also be achieved under extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external staff per 16,000 to remove snow on railway facilities and platform.
The aim is to remove the platform from operation and 90 per cent for the operation of the required fluctuations over four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the head of the Rüdiger Grube warned after meeting at the highest level with government and industry representatives against train crashes and delays also during this winter.
During the last winter period, the track had significant problems in passenger transport, as, inter alia, under difficult weather conditions, there was a shortage of reserves.
This is how many new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Authority for years.
In addition, ICE trains are delayed.
For years now, the track has also failed to control that ICE train repairs are likely to have more frequent partial controls when one ICE train occurred at Cologne’s main station to destroy the axle.
Deutsche Bank pays a million-dollar fine in the USA
After a riot around Josef Ackermann's boss, there are new roadblocks in the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of damages there.
As if the problems at home were no longer enough, Deutsche Bank caught up with his past in the US: the Frankfurt institution is paying 145 million dollars in one settlement procedure (€106 million) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's a mortgage sale.
NCUA’s financial market regulator estimates a number of large banks that they have led cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that they may have reduced risks.
In the course of the crisis, such papers have lost significant value and brought banks to ruin.
"We are pleased that we could have resolved the topic without having to drag the parties to court," said New York's spokesman Deutsche Bank.
The bank does not accept any blame by compensating them.
This is also true for the Citigroup, which committed to paying $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the kindness of the two monetary institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the USA and helps in bankruptcys to protect customer claims.
The NCUA is seeking compensation for the billions of damage caused.
Now the ending of the settlement is the first of its kind.
The regulator also relied on other large banks, and in summer he sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In questionable mortgage letters, these are so-called Mortage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the American bubble around the properties collapsed in 2007, it became fatal for a number of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed their minds.
Even though the event occurred years ago, the banks are now blowing a sharp wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous complaints in order to obtain correction or to raise doubts.
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) launched the biggest wave of complaints.
It lists 18 international banks that two US state-owned real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in mortgage trades of about $200 billion, were at risk.
Deutsche Bank also has to face FHFA's lawsuit, this is a multi-storey total of about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be responsible for "substantial losses" without, however, indicating any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the demands as unfounded and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters IBM with 10 billion
The Financial Guru Buffett invests heavily in IBM IT industry.
Since March, he has purchased more than $10 billion worth of shares.
So far, a major American investor, Warren Buffett, has always declared that he will not invest in IT and computers, because long-term company development is only allowed to anticipate with difficulty.
However, he now read IBM’s business reports and changed his views on investment in the industry.
He had to understand a long time ago that IBM offers mainly services and acquires computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
The investment of Warren Buffetta in the financial world is considered to be a match on the knights.
As a result, it may be called the IT IBM mother horn now "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett told the CNBC's U.S. Economic Broadcasting Station that he had purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM's largest shareholders, with a stake of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM didn't even know anything about his engagement yet.
He praised management, which tried to make even good returns in the economic crisis.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
IBM has been betting on lucrative IT services for a long time, such as operating computing centres.
More than a 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consultancy and powerful computers for companies.
Buffett's been avoiding tech companies until today.
He claims to invest only in undertakings whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffet hit a freight train, after a lubricant manufacturer or after machine manufacturers.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 of his own subsidiaries also shares in a number of large concerts such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, former Municher Rück.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old master took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and made it one of the most valuable investments in the world.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult character for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money brought him the nickname "Omaha Oracle."
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM shares rose by one percent before the storm began.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, has a total value of more than $220 billion on the stock market and is regarded together with Apple and Microsoft as the most valuable technological enterprises in the world.
At Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to go on.
The founder of Bill Gates is said to be his trusted friend.
The threat is tangible.
The Turkish media doubts the German state of law after the discovery of the "Bunks in Zwicka".
The newspaper even speaks of the "blood ideology", which is now alive again.
The killings of eight small entrepreneurs of Turkish origin and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a rightfully extremist background.
This report was addressed in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
For for many German Turks, it brings back the horror that has long been considered dead: Since the burning attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background.
That there is xenophobia in Germany, however, there was never any doubt.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals a range whose dimension is long overdue.
"He relives bloody ideology?" were the headlines of the internet edition of Turkish newspapers "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" emphasises that one of the perpetrators should have been a secret police agent for the protection of the Constitution and fear that the German authorities could also be involved in a right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany acted with discretion: it recalled the weekend of a demonstration of silence before the Brandebur gate of victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish municipality in Berlin remembered, together with the German and Turkish policies, the solemn act of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, a shared life was staged as a history of success.
As a field, several Turkish media reports are: "The gift of Germany to fifty" is the title of the article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which reports on the background of the murder series.
Also, the issue of the letter "Hürriyet" for Germany cannot be taken so as not to carry out this thought link.
"It's starting to smell," sounds the headline of the column by Ahmet Külagci.
He points out that the people who paid taxes and paid their jobs were murdered and made an important contribution to the restoration of Germany.
The most critical is the German Internet Forum's police procedure and its late success in the search.
Why did the German authorities not think much earlier that the suspects should be looked at in right-wing extremist circles, the authors are surprised.
Thus many are presented rhetorically ready to use drastic means: "If the activity continues so superficially, there will be nothing for immigrants but for their own defences and weapons".
"That'll be the best self-defense."
"The quality of clarification and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network is highly dependent on internal peace in Germany," writes Selen.
Which means that if internal peace in Germany is at risk, the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s explain.
The photo of the burning site in Solingen is deeply engraving into the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has made it more clear to the Turkish living here that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that distrust and retreat can trigger right-wing violence
However, the assassinations made the Turks feel more mutual.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, German policy failure after assassination was mainly criticised: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the burning attack in Solingen, he sent a compassionate telegram to the Turkish state president, but he was allowed to represent his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel at the sad celebration in Cologne - Kinkel then calculated the fees they paid to the Turks in their speech.
It's as if man's value is measured according to the amount of his tax.
Current Turkish media coverage shows once again how profound the mistrust of many German Turks in the state-run regime is.
In addition to seeking extensive clarification and a new assessment of right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
A scandalous bank near the Lake Curyš
The most comfortable bank in Europe has no headquarters in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered almost bankruptcy in the financial crisis, and since then it has shifted from one crisis to another.
Now some German has to settle it.
That's certainly not what Axel Weber meant.
Following his loud departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank, he became famous in July that he will enter the almost equally spectacular new job: the President of the Governing Board of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber looked forward to the public, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidarity and said friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has reached a turning point."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But it was clear in September that everything would turn out completely different.
One UBS dealer in London went around all of the bank's security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
Head of UBS Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland, a respected banker, had to leave.
Since then, the President of the UBS Board has also been burned - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber Bank can advise since February 2012.
And the Presidency of the Governing Council will take over in May - not just in 2013, as the bank communicated on Tuesday.
It's gonna be tough for Axel Wester.
He's not a banker, rather an economics professor and an emission banker, and he would certainly need time to work.
Suddenly, he will take responsibility for the bank's strategy, which has proven once again that he deserves the title "Bank of the biggest scandals in Europe"
Because the UBS is huge - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and it's been sliding from one scandal to another for years.
Nothing, so it seems, will remain a proud Swiss bank spared.
It started with the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had excellent reputations.
The image of a silent and solid but also resourceful asset manager combines with ambitious goals: It also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
So she managed UBS 2007 on the one hand with $1.6 billion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she went as an investment bank to the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
A former banker and a later longtime banking professor at Zurich Hans Geiger says: "I have always described UBS as a model for my students as a good bank."
"From today's point of view, how could I have been so wrong?"
He was wrong a lot.
For the first time in 2007, it was obvious that something in UBS had gone wrong properly.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, who has been regarded as a highly intelligent and also a brilliant banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, he wondered why he had left.
The investment division of the bank has lost Subprime Papers and had to write off billions.
In order to keep it steady, UBS is approving an increase in capital of indeed 13 billion francs.
Thus, she found real investors, of course, that she had recently covered with her nose: the opaque Asian State Fund of Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that man did not even know his name.
But it was just a first impact.
In April 2008, things were getting worse.
The Bank had to admit new billions of losses, the president of the board of directors, Marcel Ospel, 2006 the second most paid administrative board of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS stood in view of its wrong investments in the financial crisis and had to be saved by the state.
Nationalbank bought from UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs to compulsory bonds for which it could be co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was shaken - as it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has such large banks on its territory.
Finally, the balance sheet of UBS 2007 was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see picture).
"We could not save UBS once again," says bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster follows the second.
For several months now, UBS has capitulated the tax dispute with America and has shown a willingness to issue data from wealthy customers, who, as much as possible with the help of the bank, have cut taxes.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return of illegal profits from these stores, including a fine.
By doing so, UBS was more or less open to helping reduce taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in a competition for wealthy clients: a sanctuary of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer what it was before.
Following the resignation of the Head of the Board of Directors and the President of the Management Board.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, the Bank lost its credibility in both central commercial areas over the course of several months: in investment banking due to poor speculation and in the management of assets to help reduce taxes.
And just as it calmed down a little bit, just when UBS was thought to have recovered again, here comes this unfortunate business base: The only dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
And it's clear: with the risk management in investment banking, it's probably still not working.
"In the case of Adoola, it has probably been found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanz professor of finance at Zürich University Banking Institute.
The financial director of the large German bank is also certain: "The UBS problem is that he does not control the risk."
Yet it was precisely the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers advanced a long time ago to become guardians of the world's great assets: no too great a risk, therefore security for money - also from this side the Alpine Republic collapsed the world again.
Swiss bank vaults have become a symbol of unshakable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for especially quality chocolate.
UBS Centre in Zurich is still suitable for a cliché of good Swiss private bank - it is just a bit larger.
The position is classic.
The bank has its main headquarters in Bahnhofstraße of Zurich, which leads directly to the Lake Curysh, which is framed by snowcapped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, renting shops belong to the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's will be found here among Swiss traditional shops like the sprüngli sugar shops.
For centuries, the Swiss banks have been established: from Nationalbank through Pallast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is accessible through a heavy rotating door.
Inside, they are covered with marble, and before them stands a mighty leather chair, next to the logo of the bank a large direction towards the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank of both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometimes - suppressed or betrayed how the boss finds out one small Swiss private bank.
His name would rather not be read in the papers, he eventually closes, like all Swiss bankers, also with both large banks.
UBS has probably grown too large, it finds - especially in investment banking, where Anglosas have expanded.
I don't think the Swiss have anything to say to that.
"And if so, they adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways long ago."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon Investment Banking that changed UBS, brought it high profits at first and then a disaster: No European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of small seven million countries rose to the biggest rescue event in the history of its nation," author Lukas Hässig writes in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros have been approved by politicians to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If they're speaking to Swiss bankers, they see the problem primarily in UBS size.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks joined a powerful company.
There was a bank that was already too big for small Switzerland, and it kept growing.
However, it helped to complement the two different bank predecessors of UBS: One wealthy but sleepy bank in Zurich with the burden of managing property and poorer, but more internationally involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came in favor of a lot of money with which they could spin a big roulette.
Two names are associated with this rise in UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of UBS and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors from 2001 to 2007.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, a man who manages feelings around the stomach, who has developed completely up since banking science."
But Ospel said he trusted Wuffli to the end.
And Wuffli probably made some big mistakes at the end, "He thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
Clearly, pride precedes a fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the possessors of the executives, at whom the Wuffli company chief repeated the same password over and over again: Hit Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She listed "League Tables", a ranking that documented the success of the banks of the day.
In it, UBS tried to place it all the way up.
She's had a few moves.
In the foreign exchange and stock trade she participated in the games at the top.
However, business advisors, who have been entrusted, stress one weakness: In the international interest trade, in the words of the bankers "Fixed Income", there is probably a great distance behind the largest banks.
UBS seems to have gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS decided on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hunger after growth, the bank itself invested as well as its established venture fund in the US investment of Subprime.
It developed into a powerful machine that rewrapped securities to US mortgage loans and passed on - but also left its own risk.
Also when the other banks were looking for an exit.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS bought it there," says bank expert Geiger.
How big is the euphoria, so deep is the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than they thought.
The UBS positions have become a catapult seat, and by now they are swinging.
Whoever's running the bank now has almost impossible work to do.
They need to find a strategy for a bank that all close business models have disappeared.
Bank expert Geiger already has an idea: End of investment banking, focus on property management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far.
But the investment banking industry is about to get hit hard, so much so now it's clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, the 51-year-old Swiss Italian was only understood as a transitional solution when the bank unexpectedly broke up with the predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he argued: He has long run UBS trades, the Curysh bank reported on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to put the investment bank back on track in the mid-1990s.
3,500 seats are cut off.
But that won't do.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's her?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is already asking himself.
But the only thing he's saying so far is that he's going to find his lady in Curych's apartment first.
Next year.
The fear of recession in Europe weighs heavily on the U.S. stock market.

"We're not an island, but an addict," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe may not recover so quickly from the recession, in addition there are other signs of weaknesses of banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett just confirmed this view: He said in a CNBC survey that it will probably not be clear yet whether Europe is strong enough to do anything to end the crisis.
Therefore, it is probably too soon from his point of view to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left Buffet a few decades old principle and entered the American technology industry.

Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places, the ravens of the field are laid down as "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals cannot be expelled from the cities long ago, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have been in the city’s image for centuries, yet in some communities there are complaints of uncleanness and noise caused by animals.
But it's not against "problem birds" yet in sight.
The ravens of the field may not be able to leave the cities anymore, experts at the first symposia on crows in the eastern tip of Leer.
There experts from all over the federal territory consulted on possible exits.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Protectors of nature, however, also derived the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected harbors of the field: The use of chemistry in agriculture seems to be destroying the traditional area of life to an increasing degree.
Persecution, growing construction and laying of typical trees to nest birds make life difficult.
Crows are protected.
The large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are among other things in the West, in the northwest, including in the Jever, Diepholz and Achim, in Brem and in Leer.
There, the controversial project of mass killing crows in the rural district called for negative headlines.
Critics have identified the capture of animals in bird traps and killing ducks as particularly brutal.
"Normal banishment, fear, nothing brings," so discovered the urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver of Leer.
The removal of nests by spraying water or cutting trees often has adverse consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Badensku-Württemberska.
"The animals retreat, the great colonies split and split into other places."
Scare is only thoughtable as an exception to hospitals, pensioners' homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
A combination of expelling animals from sensitive residential areas and attracting them to settle elsewhere is thought.
"The information board instead of chainsaws" was promoted by the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens because of a completely different treatment of animals: "One sin in the face can finally break our self-esteem."
Mrs Jürgens co-founded a scientific gateway in Schleswig-Holstein ascherberg to provide information boards on the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
They say the project has already been accepted by tourists.
Also, Mrs Jürgens had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "This is every volume of communication, they have many things to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: The ravens of the field do not only use the aid to reach the memorial, but they will even make their instrument as a tool.
Researchers at Cambridge University have recently tested the behavior of four field ravens as far as the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment the birds quickly learned that the stones must lead to the collapse of the structure to get to the larvae of the pier.
Without great training, they knew the size and shape of the stone to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, dirty crows had to solve a more convoluted problem.
In the vertical structure of the cylinder, researchers placed a small container with a larvae of the pier.
Poultry couldn't reach its prey.
Of course, the researchers put a piece of wire there.
All four animals were made up of hooks that were used as hooks to hunt a container from the pipe for the holder.
Three of the four field ravens even made it through the dock.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to European Championships 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for the cup didn't come out.
Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are participating in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the Play-offs.
Leaded by a twice successful superstar Cristiano Ronald (8., 53.) Portugal defeated Bosnia-Herzegovin 6:2 (2.1) and made after 0:0 in the first game the fifth in a row at the European championship perfect.
The Czechs had enough in the playoffs with the outsider Black Mountain score 1:0 (0:0), when the first game was already a clear thing.
Brandu did not even give Croatia 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland reached 1 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) scored other goals for Portugal.

On Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal made its start in peace.
Ronaldo made early lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 meters to the net.
About a good quarter hour later he showed Nani's quality in shooting at a long distance and trfu from 25 meters modified at 2:0.
The Bosnians who didn't serve in the first half hour had their first clear chance at goalkeeper Edina Jack.
Ex-Wolfsbury from English at the head of the standing Manchester City club put the headball on the lower edge of the log, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek skins for Czech Republic
He was eventually standing in the middle of Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
After taking action against Helder Postig in the Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and gave the Portuguese a yellow card. (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark carried out a controversial criminal kick following the action of Fabio Coentraa, which Misimovic had made with certainty.
But after a break, the European Vice-Minister of 2004, with four tickets, clarified everything.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended his last doubts in 81 minutes.
This leaves the Master of Europe from 1976 to the fifth in a row at the European Championship.
The men of coach Michal Bilka with the legionaire of the Bundesliga Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second at the beginning.
Brankař Petr Čech prevented the possible identity of Tomáš Sivok (9.) from being refracted at the last minute.
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo of Stephen Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired at 40 minutes from the border of the criminal territory only close to the Czech branch.
After the break, the crossbow had to save the place of the already hit goalkeeper of the world class Bohemia, again reducing the attacker FC Soul (50.).
Branka cleared everything up shortly before the end.
Turkey missed that moment a football miracle from Zagreb.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not exceed the state 0:0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Gus Hiddink has to release his third place at the 2002 World Championships, Croatia can enjoy its fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
Before the 31,000 viewers at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks should have almost a fairy tale start.
Selcuk Inan shot seven minutes away with only a pole shot, Kazim's attacker also couldn't put the bounced ball in the goal.
After this terrible second Croatia was taking control more and more.
They didn't get the goal after the interruption either.
Along with Mario Mandzukice from VfL Wolfsburg, who had released Dortmund Ivan Perisice from 62 minutes ago, the legionaries from the Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were in action.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who took care of the 4-0 success in the first game for the preliminary decision, in the 32nd minute lead.
Konstantin Vassilev (57) settled for guests.
Ireland set a pace from the beginning, but it had to wait up to 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last minute did the Estonian defense prevent a possible goalkeeper.
At 32 minutes it was a long way from here.
After the failed defense goalkeeper Paul Londak was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to state 1:0.

Personal Massacre
Peter Englund's emotionally powerful new book called Beauty and Grief: The First World War (The Beauty and the Sorow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with such a long list of emerging characters as your head turns.
One piece of advice on how to behave at this point: carefully pull this page out and make a backup of it.
For all persons, in Mr Englund's novel story, you will get to know each other very well, and this list will serve you as a navigation - like a beacon - in moments when, like men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in various situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards Nobel Prize for literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author describes it himself, quite fittingly, as an "antihistoric work".
It contains a number of well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, and, on the contrary, there is almost a lack of ambassadors, energetic journalists, and debates on tactics and equipment.
It's not even a book about what happened, the author explains, as more of a "book of what it was like." It deals mainly with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beautiful and sorrowful" combines war experiences of 20 more fewer fat men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, rescue drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, lose their minds or die.
Their lives flicker like the flames of candles lit in the church - new ones join the complex of fates while others put out.
Mr. Englund's book differs from classical historical novels.
It regulates the idea that the first world war was just a terrible burial battle in the West Front.
"Beauty and sorrow" explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with bee nests falling on them, have to spend Christmas in the shadow of pyramids or face the presence of much tse-tse.
It's almost a very touching reading from the beginning.
War will consume people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of gunpowder.
When the gunfire starts in the distance and you're the woman who's at home with your kids, are you gonna run away or are you gonna stay?
Who's coming?
Almost nobody understands what's going on, even why the whole war was fought.
"The vacuum created by the lack of facts," Mr Englund noted, "was filled with speculations, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and fears."
"Beauty and sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are all taken from resumes, letters and other published materials.
The descriptions of their lives may sound frightening and entrenched, but the integration of small moments and details makes them absolutely alive and credible.
Many of them discuss suffering and coping with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "Remarkables, all over the place."
"Coffin substitute, aluminium copy, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
It goes further and describes the substitutes for food in Germany.
It refers to "masses made from pressed rice cooked in Skopje fat (and supplemented with fake wood bone), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato dumplings, boots with wooden soles".
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
There is an American in him who has an inner instinct for savagery and brutality, and he declares about war: "You will finally understand that this is what human nature is. No sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or a good book and pretending that this mask of yours represents civilization and that there is no barbar behind this starched self in the interior."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon, and no one will even notice, let alone grieve.
"When one finally accepts the sacrifice, at least one would expect it to happen before the eyes of the grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he feels like a "convict he hangs secretly".
Other comments relate to the departure of old Europe and the onset of new horrors.
"Conflict was becoming more and more an economic competition and a competitive battle," writes Mr Englund, "a war between factories."
He's caught what he calls "a new kind of beast of the coming century: a pronounced and ideologically entrenched mass murderer in a dress cut to the degree that he does his bloodshed without standing up from the table."
People act completely unexpected, depravity being replaced by heroism.
Mr Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a sexual disease from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front.
"The most comprehensive example of this behavior was the trade in gonococo’s manure that soldiers bought and used to wipe out genitalia in hopes of ending up in hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate of all even put him in their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this Swedish translation from Peter Graves, Mr Englund's prose is fresh, but it does not show up, which fits perfectly with his human subject.
In dozens of small outputs, it captures the way the war "has spread completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to ask why their leader is forced to fight.
The best books of World War I were mostly more than a comprehensive narrative, working with signs such as "First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fassell or novels such as "In the West Front of Peace" by Eric Maria Remarquea.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most devastating ending, which in popular scientific literature has no parallels.
But I won't tell you.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, ripped the page out of your list of heroes and set it on fire.
After a previous miscalculation this time per minute, the precisely planned event
She was attended by hundreds of police officers, some in helmets used in street riots.
Monday night on Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park should be almost empty at that time.
No one knew about the event except for a few high-ranking officers, and the others were first told it was a drill.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence highlighted the problems the police department had to face during the operation.
They were not allowed to repeat cases in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper sprays against demonstrators, which violated the rules of the department and, in addition, the wave of public sympathy shifted to the side of the squatters.
Therefore, police operations aimed at clearing Zuccotti Park from demonstrators were launched after up to two weeks of careful planning and training.
Leaders were inspired by operations carried out in other cities.
Massive behavior exercises in crisis situations took place in the Randalls Island area, which was a preparation for action in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have strengthened the so-called anxiety training - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - with a focus on the town of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park literally came "at the last minute" by someone whose actions were originally explained only as "training".
"I know a couple of officers who were also called to this action, and they certainly didn't say they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person who spoke only on condition that he would remain anonymous.
"About going to Zuccotti Park, they knew only the highest position as a member of the department."
One reason for secrecy was the lesson the city once learned.
On October 14th, city representatives were to clean up the park plan, but then they withdrew from the plan because once the demonstrators heard of it, hundreds of them were enrolled before the start of the operation in the park.
Tuesday's events were attended by police from various units, including intervention groups from around the area - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen quarters with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day, a large number of people were coming to the park and leaving again, so one hour at night was the perfect time for the event to begin.
"It was appropriate to do so at a time when as few people will be in the park as possible," he said.
Before the troops left, they lined up at the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge Bridge Bridge, freight wagons of emergency units with arched lamps and amplions.
The light and recorded report from the amplion scared many demonstrators.
When members of law enforcement units entered the park in their blue windshields, many demonstrators packed their belongings and left.
The police say that until 1:45 a.m., she didn't touch the only tent, so she wanted to give the demonstrators time to pack their things.
Other police teams were seen gathering at the edge of the park so that they could infiltrate it if any arrests were to be carried out.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, chief spokesman for the police department, claimed that this was the case for their safety.
Many journalists, however, feel that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing their units in action, and some policemen treated them rudely.
Mr. Browne claimed that television cars on Church Street leading along the western border of the park could film without problems.
Police were heading west, and there was a heavy mess of personal items protesting, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the hygiene department, who immediately collected everything left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were pulled out of the park. Documenting images appeared shortly after on the Internet.
The most entrenched group of demonstrators retreated to the vicinity of the kitchen at their camp, which lay near the middle of the park.
Some created a roadblock and the police started their methodical arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp joined in.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, said Kelly.
Emergency services members were called to cut the locks.
Until 3:30 a.m. in the park, no arrests were made, Mr. Kelly announced.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most arrests took place due to "the organisation of riots and resisting arrests," he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, was the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, head of detectives in the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he didn't share in managing the operation," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of officers were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it was necessary to call her.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, there were roadblocks.
The police then developed the security belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
At one point, police officers, many of whom were equipped with shields, were seen pushing people even further beyond that limit.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
About five o'clock this morning a protester was seen south of Pine Street as he jumped on the hood of a police car, and several others who fired air from the tires of a police delivery.
At one point, a piece of crossbow came out of the crowd.
One policeman and one protestor were hospitalized at the end of the operation.
The union of auxiliary workers will sue the city for release
Committees representing hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday. They claim that the release was not necessary and in addition was a matter of discrimination due to the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The Court is likely to be the last option left to the District Council 37 unions in their attempt to reverse the decision on release.
On October 7th, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other staff members, who were among the city's worst paid employees, described their dismissal as the city's payback for not allowing him access to the health care fund managed by the company, through which the city wanted to seal the budget gap.
The city representatives categorically rejected this accusation.
At a meeting of the City Council last month, Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott said that the release was part of a budget approved in June.
One member of the Council immediately argued that the budget did not specifically mention the release of auxiliary workers.
The representatives of District Council 37 announced that they had already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him. On Wednesday, a press conference was called where they formally announced the lawsuit at the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendants will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the prosecution will have eight workers released, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as will most of the other assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the city’s legal department, said that the city had not yet seen the lawsuit, and that is why it will not be brought to the stand.
According to the motion for a complaint that the New York Times managed to obtain, the unions focused on the number of workers released in the poor parts of the city, which they wanted to support their claims of unfair conduct, because the view remains that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have been denied sufficient funding for a long time.
They point to the fact that while the schools in Staten Island did not release at all and in the Upper East Side part only at least, in Brooklyn, in District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants were lost, and in District 8 and 9 in South Bronx, as many as 46 assistants were released.
Reminds me that five out of eight assistants lost their jobs at Public School 36 in Harlem, although this is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty, and the lawsuit says, "It's not a neighborhood full of talkative parents who can provide funding to settle the deficit in the budget."
The Public School Budget 36 was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way in which bonus finances were calculated for every student who was registered.
In addition, the boards argue that the principals of secondary schools may have been confused by the way in which the document approving the release of parent coordinators was written.
The document used the word "excess" to describe the action, which is to cancel the position, although the word is often used to describe the transfer of the teacher from the school's payroll to the database of available workers whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators have been released," says the complaint proposal, "and not just moved to the database to position available workers."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to adopt an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress will agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
But before this happened, the revolution had to succeed, the long-standing dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, had to be captured and killed, and the participation of United States troops had to be terminated.
On Tuesday, the Senate International Relations Commission will decide on a statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass) together with Senator John McCain (Ariz) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn) in which it should congratulate the Libyans on their successful rise and thank the American units for their "resistance".
"With this statement we want to appreciate the courage of the Libyans who began to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
These sentences may seem innocent, but there is no debate concerning Libya until now that it has not been easy.
Over the summer, legislators from both sides constantly argued between themselves and the White House for a series of declarations to approve or, on the contrary, to reject the military role of the United States in the NATO Mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution allowing limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of the differing views of both political parties, so it was never voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same date that the proposal was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected measures to halt the financing of US operations in Libya.
This led the American mission in Libya to literally find itself in legislative purgatory - Congress criticised the way President Obama manages the mission, but his members apparently did not get enough annoyance to stop supporting him in his efforts.
The importance of the convention was eventually preceded by further events.
The rebels conquered Tripoli in August, and on October 20, he was killed by Gaddafi.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31st.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission for International Relations in its statement "grates the Libyans for their immeasurable courage and awe-intention, which they have committed to liberate their people" and "the praises of the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies who have engaged in the operation to protect the Libyan population for extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The declaration also "confirms the United States' national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal receive the full support of the Commission for International Relations, or will the legislators be split back into two halves, as was the case with the approval of the June proposal?
Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the chief representative of the Republican Party in the commission, stood up against the latest version.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
This week, in the House, there will be a vote on the addition to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, implemented by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addition to the Constitution in respect of the budget or other subject matter on which the entire House or Senate will vote.
For the time being, the other legislators have not yet been able to push their proposals to the vote.
Goodlatt's proposal is only one of 68 additions to the constitution that were presented in Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to both the House and the Senate - and others are only minor changes of others.
Only in the House can you find at least 15 versions of the balanced budget allowance and another handful, which would like to "regulated federal expenditure".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters - especially the beginnings of republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their "authorities".
The revenue on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, required that both the House and the Senate vote on the subsidy relating to the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of an independent declaration in support of the creation of such an additive.
In addition to the budget, several members wish to discuss the limitation of the number of periods in which the members of the Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods in which the President may serve.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill) offered a number of supplements that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
An extension prohibiting the marriage of couples of the same sex and a supplement prohibiting the burning of the flag shall remain a permanent proposal.
Some legislators also want to allow for the annulment of federal laws if two-thirds of the states oppose them.
Although the members of Congress appear to be very active in proposing various additives, they do not significantly exclude them from the average compared to previous years.
At 111, they offered 77 supplements to Congress, while at 100, there were 66 of them.
Their activity is even pale compared to the early 1990s, where according to statistics, members offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
But they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last addition that was added - the 27th supplement - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Breaked but not defeated," says Gifford in his first television interview since the shooting.
Ten months after she was wounded by a gunman at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz) appeared on national television on Monday night, she sang along with a song from a Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that more than returning to Congress was worth getting better.
Giffords appeared on show "20/20" at ABC News station with Diane Sawyer, and it was evident that the construction of the sentence was still making her trouble and she needed help walking.
The entire show documented her difficult reconstruction, which was necessary for a bullet wound that penetrated her skull in the front, penetrated the left half of her brain, and left her at the back of her head out.
Three months ago, she suddenly returned to the House to vote triumphantly on the debt ceiling.
During her first television interview since the January shooting, during which six people were killed and another 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - while her recovery described her as "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, one-and-a-half-year-old Giffords replied, "That's pretty good."
Interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hourly special program of the show "20/20", which was sent in the evening of the release of the new book of this couple, entitled "Gabby: Story of Courage and Hope".
The special's been tracking the entire Gifford Reconvalence since the 8th of January shooting.
On the videos Kelly made during the first week, Giffords is seen in a hospital bed with shaved head and a long scar across his forehead.
While her husband encourages her, he can't do more at the time than just raise one or two fingers.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and the therapists are teaching her how to carry out simple activities.
Shaking your head.
Ripped lips.
And then, her first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords said another word -- " toast" when she demanded changes in her breakfast.
Videos broadcast by ABC Station show that the crucial role for the recovery of Giffords played music: Congresswoman sings on them together with a therapist on the tune to the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During an interview with Gifford, who spent two hours a day in therapy, Sawyer said that he didn't remember anything from the day he was shot.
Her husband said that Gifford read newspaper articles on shooting until March 12 when she first asked him who she was, who was the six who was killed in the incident.
From the shooting, the suspect is Jared Lee Loughner, who is detained in the Missoura prison, where he is awaiting trial under the influence of violent drugs.
"A lot of people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Woeful, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer said that at one point his wife said during the reconstruction, "I lost."
"So I said to her, 'Gabby, you didn't lose,' said Kelly.
"You just got hit.
But you can do it, you can get together, and you can come back stronger than ever."
Military units meet with compassion rather than respect
The event was a gala night on Wall Street, bringing out millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots, and marines ran past it.
The solemnly clothed crowd rose up and applauded enthusiastically.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organised the spring benefit.
The then chairman of the Staff Committee attended the celebration evening. In addition to him there was Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of the military units somewhat differently.
"They were all introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respect.
So completely opposite impressions only illustrate the uneasy relationship between the army and often measured, sometimes celebrating the American public.
The army is scrutinized with praise for its victims.
But this praise is worth something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting like an individual in a uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who was in charge of Iraqi troops and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or to ruin their relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that troops had to face returning from Vietnam once was much worse.
As a result, most words of regret are spoken in silence and privacy among war veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Canciana returned from battle activities where they served as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that people outside the army would look at their service from two angles.
From the standpoint of some, they will feel respect and admiration because they defeated the enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
But to others, he will drill his head if "there is no evil, violent veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who took part in the fighting in Iraq and took a place in Washington, D.C., on his return.
He claimed that when he was looking for work, some of the people who interviewed him were insidiously suggesting that he could resist the stress of working in Washington soon after returning from battle.
"When you talk about your service, you must count on negative reactions," Cancian taught his sons.
Concerned by the army, partly the source of American indifference to war.
The success of the battlefield will only ease the recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own army and finds little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer respect military heroism as was common in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition of politicians and the public focuses primarily on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are rewarded for the number of actions they suffered, the number of friends they lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to take a hard turn against rape
This week, it will decide whether the trial of 28 women and men against the military will be initiated because of alleged inaction in the case of rape.
If not, they are prepared to file complaints against hundreds of other applicants.
The first-class soldier, Elizabeth Lyman, was allegedly raped by a fellow soldier in the army for 25 years and was 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008 and she was heading to the barracks at Miramar air base north of San Diego. After dinner with her friend she ran into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her so she could have a little drink in her room.
"The warning light lit up in my head," Lyman said.
But the native Texas ignored her objections completely.
I thought to myself, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
He claims that only minutes after they entered her room, a man passed over to her, threw her on the bed, and raped her.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 other existing or former members of the army will be waiting for a verdict of a hearing that could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and will discuss whether the charges against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The indictment states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to fight the proliferation of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The charges were filed in February by Washington's lawyer, Susan Burke, and the prosecution had 17 members at that time. In the coming months, however, their number increased to 28 - 25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army and that the army failed to investigate, punish and prosecute any prosecution for justice.
Burke says he's going down the throat to the highest-ranking military commanders, because the problem starts with them.
"Armada is a legislative system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent any attempt to take measures against such acts?
Burke also claims that since February she has contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of whom could be part of other complaints filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than gathering all the charges into this case - she laid all the eggs in one basket, as she says - would file lawsuits in several different cases, if necessary, to pressure nepolil.
The defence team is led by the U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, together with his associates, has filed an appeal against the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek discuss in detail the defence strategy - in principle it is that current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the 1950 Supreme Court Order, known as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injury suffered by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries relate to the military service of the defendants," the document reads.
The Ministry of Defence has refused to speak on this matter.
Things have changed since the 1950 ’ s.
Although women still officially cannot serve in battle, it is only vocabulary: in modern wars, it is difficult to find a clear front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women's soldiers played an increasingly significant role, especially in the area of communication with civil women in the war zone.
Result: 150 female soldiers fell among these wars - two-thirds of them in battle.
The time has come to modernise even in the army, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight, except in the case of three other legal representatives.
At Yale Law School, visitors to the Veteran Seminar on Legal Services are preparing an appeal to the four main military academy for the alleged development of an atmosphere that promotes hatred for women.
Independently of this, the unprofitable organisation of American Vietnamese veterans collects the grounds for their lawsuit against the military. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of "personal violations", which was allegedly found in the victims of rape to have the army's excuse for their release - according to activists such as Anna Bhagwatiová, belonging to the human rights group Service Women's Action Network, is a completely normal practice.
Her group had already filed a motion in December for an action against the State organisation for dealing with veterans, which it accused of discriminatory practices that were to occur in processing requests for assistance from persons who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented in Congress, which were presented by a group of senators and members from both political parties and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Office for Prevention and Solution of Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defence, 3 158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unannounced in most cases and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this number corresponds to approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19 000 incidents that occurred in the given year.
A report issued in March also discusses the rate of prosecution of suspects: 20 per cent of the cases reported in the military came to court in 2010 - half of them against the civil justice system.
Prosecutors in the case of Agent Burke describe the attacks as the first of a series of traumas.
First - class soldier Lyman, for example, reported an alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was due to happen.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape to 11 different members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She subjected all the tests necessary to determine the rape and in her bed was found the blood of the attacker - from the wound she made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended the hearing before the court, during which she was asked questions about whether she had made love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned to testify as witnesses of the reputation in favor of the alleged offender, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down," Lyman says.
"I had the feeling that I would deliver right there in the delivery room - with a scream I ran out of the courtroom."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "It wasn't his judgment. It was mine."
The Lymans ordered a military psychiatrist to visit her, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, thus calling her incapacitated.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without honor and therefore without entitlement to benefit.
Whether or not the Lyman case and the other prosecutors move to the next stage, it is a long run, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington Law University.
Of course, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to proceed to further stages of the discussion."
However, between them and the verdict is the mentioned doctrine, which has been criticized since the first moment she saw the light of the world.
I am myself a lifetime critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is a few decades behind because their duties fail to comply with the same degree of motivational incentives and deterrents.
He adds, "The chances are hard on them... but it's important for them to try."
Change will take place only when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided in their favour, Burkevoya, the prosecutor's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other persons prepared to file an action and will start working on other cases related to the subject.
"Let us not stop fighting the army on this issue, where reform will not come from," he says.
Or until we die, according to what comes first.
The walls have eyes: how scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his opposition views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murderous rage that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, in cyberspace he was definitely not alone: during the preparation of the attack he spent a lot of time on the computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social networks.
After this summer's tragedy, scientists want to know more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
"We realized that finding them is not really that hard," says Jamie Bartlett, the leading author of the recent British research team's report on European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, Bartlett says that scientists were sufficient to easily use the advertisement on the site and, by doing so, to be absolutely accurate, to identify the demographic group that has been sought - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups to focus on them and to send them ads, but instead of inviting them to join a newly formed group or offer them some diet products, they called for questionnaires on their level of education, their relationship to violence and optimism in view of their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
"It is a completely new way of carrying out research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not quite surprising: online right-wing groups are all young men who are encouraging an increasing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are smarter, more democratic and less violent than those who remain permanently hidden behind the screen of the computer."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, medical scientists and political researchers use these pages to study everything, from health problems to social trends, hiding in state updates, dead posts and pressed buttons "I like it".
Facebook reports over 800 million active users. Each of them will provide on average three different data, which makes this social network literally "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic works in which the name Facebook appears has increased against the state nearly five years ago to 800%.
For some scientists the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"It used to be true that when you wanted to conduct a survey among British nationals, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to a side where they'd never let you go," Bartlett says.
"This is all Facebook breaking up - you're just going right to them."
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a social-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who were discussing their drunken performances on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent on the subject.
Moreno proposes that classmates on the site monitor and come with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunk statuses.
"The problem cannot be solved if you can't diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Morena and the director of the Centre for the Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We've found a way to identify endangered children that we wouldn't otherwise have a chance to discover."
Facebook itself constantly probes the data of its users.
The website’s information team has developed statistics on the relationship status and Valentine’s Day, the 2010 election participation and the coefficient of satisfaction of the nation (mainly using the information they had access to - Internet freedom advocates have long argued that the website should make its information available to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the website is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometers away, the site needs to provide its personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect off-line data. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
"As far as I'm concerned, most users didn't even think that scientists could look into their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, of a 2006 study conducted using the public facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it so that there was only information between them and their friends."
Next, consider the question of methodology.
Even with off-line research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There is no way to verify on Facebook how much information on the profile and contributions to the wall is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook, these are two completely different things," explains Selwyn.
That is why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, thinks that pencils and notebooks continue to remain the best possible tool that can be used in research.
"When you go into the real world and you talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still happening off-line."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to the establishment of two attacks during which 77 people were killed this summer in Norway during his first public court hearing in Oslo, described himself as a fighter of "rebellion".
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance and among the Norwegian Templar Knights," he declared before a court where 500 people were gathered.
"I object to the court because your mandate has been given to you by organizations promoting the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I do not admit any guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik interrupted during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could report his views."
For the same reason, he refused to speak to Breivik, who brought with him a speech prepared, to allow his relatives to address their victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivika in custody for another 12 weeks, to prohibit any contact with the media for 4 weeks and to announce that the competent authorities would have complete control over all his visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives and survivors attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope that they would be able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure that he was held firmly under the castle.
They all took part in the effort to move the case to early closure.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," the NRK commentator said one of the survivors of the attack.
"It was nothing pleasant, but I can say for myself that after I saw and heard the suspect, I went a little bit further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. On coming and going to the building without difficulty by sighting the present journalists and survivors into the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge admitted that he was not crazy, and noted that there was no evidence that he had any accomplice.
For someone, it may be comforting to know that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the sorrow and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she'd look like a monster, but she's not," said one of the victims.
"If I did, everything would be much easier."
7 lessons from the lost conversation with Steve Jobs in the movie going to the movies this week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5th, the views of the people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear, and they chose him for his genius as the greatest modern inventor.
In the recent reproached Jobs interview, which was pollinated for the special film that goes to the movies this week, Apple’s fans will find the fact that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and the workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, dreamer and self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but at the same time, he was also a pedantist organizer and man who put every detail in the smallest detail - believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "the idea that a really great idea is 90 percent of their work... [but] between an excellent idea and an excellent result is still a long way to work."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on a TV show called the Triumph of Computer Fools, which discussed the dawn of personal computers. During the filming, there was a unique, more than an hour interview.
At that time, it had been ten years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he had his hands full with his new computer company NeXT, and he was impatient to see how the wide public would accept the Internet.
In the TV show, only a short part of the entire Cringely interview was used and the original copies of the interview were claimed to have been lost during the transport.
Shortly after Job’s death, however, VHS copies were found in the director’s garage.
This material, slightly cut off, forms the basis of a 68-minute picture of Steve Jobs: Lost Interview, heading to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
To someone who has heard his distaste for longer interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly excited to be able to discuss his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it also turns out to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, when to see how Job's answer perfectly contemplates to be as prestigious and as precise as possible.
There are also moments when Job’s perfectionism comes out on the surface when Cringely’s questions are impatienced and stimulates him to get into more important problems and issues.
The interview was recorded before the age of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, and there are frightening prophetic ideas in it when Jobs evaluate what other companies do well and poorly, offering their own vision of the future in computer technology.
One thing is to read the postmortem evaluation of Jobs' career, but on Jobs, which we see here as a keen dreamer in the bloom of his genius, is something raw and inspiring.
He has here his own vision of what they might and should look like.
It did not last long, and after his thoughts had been spoken, he also began to put it into practice.
Quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noticing:
How he learned to run a business:
"Over the years of business, I've always asked myself, "Why are you doing this?" and the answer was always the same: well, that's just how you do it."
No one knows why he does what he does, never thinks deeply about business matters.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing his efforts to simplify accounting in Apple.
He was completely confused about the way the costs were recorded - often started with the inscription "standard costs", about their height he could only have guessed. At that moment he decided to take his own route - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that the commercial costs could be determined within a moment.
As he did the Pope's bidding:
Jobs remembers the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that enabled people to effectively hack into the phone company and call anywhere in the world for free.
A number have been written about the device in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as an instrument of power, is virtually contagious.
It tells how Wozniak was tested using a paid phone, and during the call they were transferred from one AT&T network to another, while using as many satellites as possible.
"At least half a dozen times we got this confused around the world, so when we screamed at the paid phone, it came out a minute later from the second phone at the door," he laughs.
"We were young, and we found that we were able to construct ourselves a thing that is able to drive infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world."
Two of us made a tiny little thing that was able to control a much larger giant - it was an incredible experience, and I don't think Apple would ever have started without it.
Jobs continues with a description of the joke that almost reached the end with Wozniak. By means of the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called in the Vatican and asked if they could speak to the pope, with the best appearance for Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, members of the Catholic Church were called upon to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they had raised the pope himself to the telephone, the couple were scattered and the listener lay down.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and he was looking for spare parts so he could build a mayor, he found a number on Bill Hewlett's phone list and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had a secured summer brigade in Hewlett-Packard.
It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what this company is and how it's supposed to treat its employees.
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer ever made".
He was big as a trunk, he had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him right away.
As a teenager in HP, I progressed higher and higher, hanged myself around that computer and started writing programs for him.
How innovation is invented:
In several places, Jobs discusses how new products are being invented during the interview.
At the beginning of his career, when he sold a few boards with flat circuits, a customer asked him to assemble a whole computer for him.
There were only 30 paid days available, during which he had to invent, install and add finished equipment.
When he was later in Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember how we fought pretty wildly... they shouted at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] when I stopped having fun, I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies breathe:
Long before leading Apple's resurrection, Jobs prudently predicted that many industrial leaders in his vision would collapse and lose their market share.
"Let's say you work with IBM or Xerox, so you do better copiers or printers, well, what else?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At that moment, there's a lot of distance and marketing going on, so the companies are being run by people who are in charge of this, while the people in charge of their own products are being run out of decision-making process.
The technological genius that the company has brought to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That's exactly what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times as big as it is, it could have been Microsoft in the '90s...
Instead of winning, however, they won the prize.
How does he take innovation as a form of art:
"There's a long way and a lot of work between the excellent idea and the excellent result product... and as this great idea develops, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to enter a whole range of compromises - certain things you just don't force electrons, glass, robots or factories to do.
You have to remember 5,000 things all the time - different concepts - and put them together...
In the end, it depends on the taste - you try to think about the best things that mankind has ever created, and in some ways you try to project them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I was never ashamed that I stole the best ideas.
MacIntosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and, by the way, also the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they would have done amazing things in completely different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the Health Care Act at the time of their trial
On the day when the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether to adopt an objection to the law on the healthcare of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a solemn dinner sponsored by a legal firm to participate in the proceedings before the court.
The event occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the proposals submitted.
One of the cases under consideration was the lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging the radical processing of health care, which Congress approved last year - a law that mobilised conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the action. In March, however, a five-hour hearing is expected, the result of which will further develop the presidential elections planned for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and try to enforce the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. Attorney General for the Government of George W. Bush.
Clement's legal firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has been defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations challenging the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which there are huge funds at stake in the process.
Dinner was held at the Washington Hotel hours after a court hearing on the subject of the case.
She was also attended by Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of the Senate and confirmed opposition to the Health Care Act.
And the guests' introductions?
It is nothing new: these two judges have been participating in the Federalist Society for years.
And it's certainly not about anything that contradicts the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct to which the lower federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their behaviour would definitely fall under principle C4, which says that "a judge may participate in actions which are directly related and other organisations holding for the purpose of obtaining funds, but a judge may not be a speaker, an honest guest, nor be included in the action programme."
However, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas to two law firms active in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in this case, was largely enough to alert ethical activists in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the statement of several judges that the highest court behaves according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause organization.
"The judges drank and dineed on the social benefit together with legal representatives waiting to discuss their case before the court."
Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds through this action undermines the legs by alleging unbiasedness, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little understanding to their critics and told them that they, too, have no problem combining their judicial duties with actions by groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a highly-built conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that the ethical problem is primarily the case of Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kaganová worked as Attorney General for President Obama's government when the first objections to the law appeared before the court.
Khagan’s critics are pushing her to abandon her involvement in the case and claim that she fought for the law at that time rather than now unbiased.
Kagan never indicated that she was going to resign.
Boeing has won a record contract for power airplanes worth USD 18 billion
The Emirates airlines offer 50 two-way Boeing 777 jets with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it collects more than USD 1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, it's usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if this company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aeroplanes totals a record USD 18 billion, it is something else.
Similarly, the important message is where Boeing obtained the contract: Middle East, growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast issued Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need $2,520 worth of USD 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced on the weekend her biggest order in history regarding the dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 two-way Boeing currents 777.
The sensational order came from Emirates airlines based in Dubai.
Boeing at the 2011 Dubai Air Show announced that airlines have the opportunity to purchase another 20 aircraft, making the total value of the contract rise to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air Airlines had ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which boasts significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six aircraft exceeds USD 1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the whole Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil-dwelling nations there.
This means that they have not only money to pay the aircraft, but a rise in fuel prices - mostly damaging airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so crucial because the country itself earns higher oil prices.
This is important because it is not as likely for them as for other airlines that they could cancel or postpone orders of aircraft due to an increase in fuel prices, Dihora says.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The Emirates Airline contract strengthens Boeing’s leading position on the wide-hulled aircraft market and brings Airbus SAS to its close company, which tried to disrupt Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus’s representatives announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, which is a direct competitor of aircraft 777-300ER, would take place.
The deviation was due to the fact that the customers required more useful loads of the plane and the flight, so it took the manufacturer time to give the machines more power to the engine.
The price of Boeing Co's shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexico's President's sister was reportedly defeated in the Michigan elections.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon of the PRI, was helped in the pursuit of the governor’s chair by drug traffickers.
Sister Felipe Calderon seems to have lost in a violent state election to post governor in Michoacán. On Monday, she announced that one of her opponents had been helped by drug traffickers.
Preliminary results have been attributed to the leadership of the Western State governorate, Faust Valley, by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The involvement of members of organised crime in the entire electoral process, and especially until yesterday's election itself, is alarming not only for Michoacán but for our country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in an interview for the radio day after Sunday's elections.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the public opinion research group... confiscated the election urns, built roadblocks... and let people vote on the order for PRI.
The PRI ruled in Mexico for seven decades until the year 2000 when the Presidency was lost.
However, it plans a swift return to power and victory in the elections in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PR Party hopes to win the presidential election in July as well.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who led the election the day before, only very closely.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative side of her brother's National Action Party, or PAN, refused to accept Vallenon as the winner.
The third was located by Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left hand side of the Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, which until now controlled the governor's office. For the disputing and unfortunately persecuted party, the presidential election in 2012 was very unfortunate.
Aureoles also refused to consider the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital city of Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and invites other candidates to recognise the results.
Michoacán has been controlled for a long time by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
This is the birthplace of President Calderon and it was in Michoacán that the military struggle against traffickers began in December 2006.
However, violence persisted.
PAN mayor Luisa Marie Calderon was murdered only a week before the elections and many candidates for the election gave way to fear.
However, whether the results of the elections in Michoacán appear to be for the PR side anyway, the victory of the party will help to gain a new momentum.
The expected representative of the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Wahington Valley, congratulated and said, "I think this victory, given the coming year, could be very encouraging."
ADB calls on Asia to help save the eurozone
Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be ready to help save the Eurozone from its serious debt crisis, otherwise the overall decline in the world economy, which would have a negative impact on economic growth in Asia.
Rajat Nag, CEO of the ADB Bank based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help quickly recover the currency block through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned against the fact that the states of the Bric group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] are monitoring all European difficulties "too unsettled" and declared that Asian financial assistance, combined with European leadership and resources, will help to spark the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is in line," he said to the Financial Times during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asie may be protected to some extent, but she is certainly not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
For several months now, the European Monetary Association has been struggling with a serious debt crisis.
In recent days the borrowing costs of Italy have risen dangerously, and both the Prime Minister of Italy and Greece have stepped down.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that the global economy could come into recession again, and calls have begun to appear to bring the emerging leading economies together and to help the euro area find solutions.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian aid would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as buying bonds from the European Union Financial Aid Fund - would give the Asian partners of the European countries more negotiating options.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do what it can" to help the Eurozone, because its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and the draining of foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are facing a difficult challenge and must maintain a high growth rate."
"It's not an alternative, it's a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies, such as Indian economies, have nothing to do to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to explain aid to Europe to 1.2 billion people in India, when 800 million of them live on $2 or less a day.
"One could find out that the Greeks are retired in their 50s and enjoy vacations on the beaches, which would be difficult to explain," he noted.
Lee Howell, Director General of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain well-paid employment for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and lost sectors, such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis is threatening "the dangerous domino effect".
The Bank's forecast that between 2011/2012 and 2011/2012 there will be 7.5% of economic growth, now faces a "danger risk" due to the European threat.
He stated that vulnerable emerging markets must create "unforeseeable expenditure plans" in order to be protected from decline and a significant capital outflow from their economies.
Alert from the Pentagon on possible defence cuts
On Monday in Congress, Defence Minister Leon Panetta firmly added to the boiler when he warned that emerging automatic budget cuts could endanger national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting in the Pentagon and continuing through the Afghanistan battlefield to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend $450 billion in budget cuts over the next ten years, but now it fears a further $600 billion reduction if the Congress fails to conclude an agreement on expenditure.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senator John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and that the so-called situation would cause 23% of the flat-rate decline and stop many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, used in this reckless way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you cannot buy only three quarters of the building or ship. Moreover, there could be serious damage to other modernisation efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will also have to send almost certainly civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake with the faith of those who care for our army and seriously damage its readiness."
In the end, the cuts will also be touched by combat units, Panetta announced.
"Although the accounts for financing possible overseas war operations will not directly affect this situation, the operations there will be negatively affected by serious changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will be cuts in contractual personnel, which will result in the delay in contracted contracts supporting the war effort of our people."
"The status of paid employees will be reduced, which will also result in delayed payments to suppliers and subsequent disruption of legal and political support."
Both Senators of Pant wrote down ten days ago and asked for details on the possible impact on automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of a stay at the Ministry of Defence could cause a rapid degradation of view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this tough measure," the senators announced in a joint statement Monday afternoon when Pant's letter was published.
"It's not the conclusion that we can live with, and we definitely don't want to sign it."
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It is only to be seen whether Pantt's letter and fresh warning will increase the pressure on Congress approving the budget and will increase the votes calling to exclude the Pentagon from the list of screeched areas.
Panetta has recently been more open in talks about possible cuts, although he himself moved to his high position in the Pentagon with long years of experience in approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew that he was going into a tough fight.
At a press conference organized a minute week of defense, the Minister indicated a brief picture of what his department might be waiting for - an army shell, but within which the core will be missing.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors."
"It'll be like a brigade without ammo."
"It'll be like aviation without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without a sufficient number of trained soldiers who could complete the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of the speech in the Pentagon.
"He'll be like an unethical unit, unprepared and unable to deal with a potential enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In the Annex, which has been added by letter to McCain and Graham Panetta, it will specify how the reduction will result in "excellent operational risks: late responses to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant restrictions on the possibility of landing and deployment worldwide; anticipated unacceptable risks in future combat operations."
Panta added that some of the biggest defence projects could be expected to end, including those already tested, even those that are only in the early stages of planning.
For example, the F35 aircraft project, the planned new bomber, the ballistic submarines of a new generation, the new coastal battleship, and the new ground combat vehicle that the army and marine infantry wanted to replace humvee.
The end of further development and testing of F35 would save $80 billion over the next ten years, but its supporters argue that it is a necessary further step in improving the army that needs to be addressed by China and other rivals.
How to Recognize the Lie
The summer view of recent newspaper headlines tells how serious and widespread lies and lies are in everyday life.
Republican Presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy accusing him of sexually harassing several women - both sides claim that the other lies.
University administrators at Penn State were accused of perjury when they tried to hide the records of a retired football coach sexually attacking a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was found to be lying to the American President Barrac Obama, as he said with the microphone launched, that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie was able to destroy entire careers and make many countries feel stable.
The New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published information that was immediately returned with irrefutable evidence.
Former Presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of using his campaign funding to try to conceal his unmarried affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that crashed around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period in office about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinska.
It's all about cheating at school and university.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make them look good in their opinions.
Men who should teach the opposite are reporting that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much fraud are we dealing with?
Studies show that on a single day, you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Suppose many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that during the first ten minutes of the first meeting in life, strangers lied three times.
Determining lies, or "recognition of lies", is a necessary skill that everyone should acquire for personal or work reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, let's say, Sharada, when a person shouts, "I have you". Recognition of deception is a serious sector of science working with scientific data gathered over the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of research is that most of the old myths about lies have been reversed.
Liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're shivering, grunting, blushing, or stitching.
However, do not make it difficult for a liar to notice and reveal himself.
A trained liar identifier can reveal the truth from the eternal structure, small expressions in the face, the way questions are created and their timing.
I have spent several years collecting scientific knowledge from a vast and developing sector on the recognition of lies, and it is clear that revealing deception is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can be very helpful in today's complex world - especially if your work obligations include hiring, organizing interviews, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them water them in care, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other party accepts them.
We know from research that extraverts lie more often than introverts, that men passing more "self-centered" lies, while women say more lies "focused on others" - mostly because they protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than free people (but the lies they say are usually "insultive").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
It's called "the initial observation."
It will allow him to find out later what he is comparing.
Notice the holding of the subject's body, his laughter, his voice work.
You should know if someone regularly knocks on their feet so that they don't wrongly accuse him of lying just because they start knocking their feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to determine the sounds of false verbal and non-verbal behavior.
But consider it only as warning signals, not as proof of a lie.
People who carry a lie can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their fictional story, they can shoot the boots to the door, move to the east, significantly change the hold of the body or give an indication of "relievance after the conversation" - exaggerated relaxation and change of position when it is difficult to confess behind them.
People conducting interviews often give a false signal that there is an end to the interview, just to see what a relief it will look like after it ends.
Also notice the subject’s language.
The famous story is how Scott Peterson once overturned himself and used the past time to claim that his murdered wife was alive, which led to a nationwide search for her body.
Deceptive individuals may also express themselves disproportionately: "I had no sexual relationship with this lady... Miss Lewinska" or the difficult question will be repeated.
The most common verbal signs are only very insignificant.
Someone can use a lot of "relieving language" when he answers the difficult question, "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... according to my best knowledge."
We will not know too many facts in such a response, and this is often another warning signal.
There is no magic to expose any lie, but it is possible to acquire skills that can help track the lie.
With these skills, a person will have a better chance of not running into a liar and a fraud in his personal and work life.
The controversial plan for the construction of oil pipelines will be redirected after the threat of delay of approval by the US government has emerged
A few days after Obama's government threatened to delay approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - making it possible for the trade unions, but calming environmentalists - the construction company announced that it was willing to redirect the project to put things back into motion.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it would move the planned pipeline route from the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and is convinced that the project will be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference in the headquarters of the Nebraska government.
TransCanada Alex Pourbax argues that the company is convinced that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it will lead a different route.
This notification came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it was delaying the decision on the federal authorisation of the project, from which it would not carry out a study of possible alternative routes, which would allow it not to reach Sandhills in Nebraska and the aquifer Ogalala, a vast underground water supply facility.
"This is really a shift forward," said Republican representative Lee Terry of Nebraska for Fox News.
The new environmental assessment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably not have moved any decision until 2013, i.e. one year after next year's elections, but the authorities refuse to play a role in the decision.
Obama described the decision in a written statement last week as a request from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and expressed his support.
1,700 miles of long pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Albert to the refineries in Texas, 700,000 barrels of oil flow daily.
Six states will have to cross this road.
This project is totally hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by the task force, who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear when working on the pipeline.
However, the laws in Nebraska opposed this plan and considered the introduction of laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and in the aquifer Ogallala, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The ongoing study on the environmental impact ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but a source from the energy industry said that the general inspector from the Ministry had ordered a new review of the whole process of the initial study and focused mainly on two issues.
One was whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's advisor in 2008, was not a conflict of interest in the programme.
Furthermore, whether the company that was hired for the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBell is accused of throwing up fears over her.
The New York family claims that Patty LaBelle's singer stormed into their Manhattan house's lobby and scared their daughter by throwing up her fear.
The result of the hit singer "Lady Marmalade" scared the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "change of personality, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family claims in a lawsuit filed with the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10th last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were planning a family trip.
When Kevin Monk got the car back, Roseanna Monk gathered herself down to the lobby of their house in the Riverside Boulevard, carrying Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door for a moment and put the baby away for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter's doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went to pick her up."
Labelle was infuriating with a pregnant woman.
"In an aggressive tone, she said to me, 'You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,' said Rosanna Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care what you think."
She got angry and started talking dirty - loudly shouted the simplest expressions...
She had a bottle of water on her, and she began to catch water from me.
She claims Genevieve got a hysterical seizure.
"I told the woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," the mother said.
LaBelle took her mother - who was still in her arms Genevieve - threw her and had to stop her until her escort, who then dragged her into the waiting car, told Rosanna Monk.
Meanwhile, the daughter screamed so much when she puked, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter requesting an apology from Labelle, but they received no answers.
Labelle's lawyer and spokeswoman don't respond to our calls to make a statement about the whole cause.
The lawsuit requires a closer indemnity, but the family attorney, Sam Davis, said that the case was taken free of charge and that the family plans all the money they have earned to devote to a charity organization dedicated to children with cancer.
"The aim is to get Patti Labelle to take responsibility for her starting," Davis said.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate disengages the economy
During the first year of the reign of Maria Lópeze Valdez, unemployment and insecurity grew in Sinaloa, foreign investment decreased, and economics
This is the first year of the government of Maria Lópeze Valdez, which is called the Government of Change. This government has brought with it great expectations for economic progress, but because of the adverse climate conditions at the beginning of the year, there has been no growth and even a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
Low February temperatures have caused millions of losses in agriculture, reduced the growth potential of the state economy, reduced economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In the area of agriculture, there has been a historic decline of 31.16%, which has disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors as well.
According to the report on damage caused by the Mexican Rural Sustainable Development Board, the damage was recorded at 582,835 hectares of farmed soil, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and partial damage was detected on the remaining 21.07%. Among the main crops destroyed are vegetables, maize and peas.
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the state’s unemployment rate increased steadily during the first three quarters of the year. Between January and March, 55,053 people in Sinaloa were unemployed, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the country’s economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5.28% and between July and August, average unemployment increased to 6.19%, representing approximately 74,000 unemployed.
Liabilities
According to Gerard López Cervantes, director of the UAS Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, an increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly on the basis of steps taken at public policy level.
"We are witnesses of rising unemployment, which has to do with various factors. These include, among other things, the loss of liquidity on the market due to limited resources as a result of legislation approved by Congress in the fight against the laundering of dirty money. For people who illegally acquire dollars, it is not easy to earn them, invest them or use them," he stressed.
Stop migration
López Cervantes said that demographic factors are also involved in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who go abroad to work in the United States has fallen, however, for reasons of difficult entry and then because even though these people get abroad, it is difficult for them to get a job. People are staying and demanding work from our state, and so unemployment is growing," he said.
Untrustworthyness
The analysis of the working market in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the growing volatility prevailing in working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed population in the state is working without providing benefits to social security administration.
Other features of the labour market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and lack of reliability. In this administrative territory, the lowest wages from all over the country are stated by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa until September 5 352 pesetas, deep below the national average, was 7 375 pesetas.
Reduction of foreign direct investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and growth in unemployment, the most significant decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance between January and June, direct foreign investment reached $630,697, which represents a decrease of 87.74% compared to $5,143,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Government sets out investments of 17,280 million pesetas per year.
Debt
In connection with the economic downturn scenario, the government of this country asked the state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be for investments in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to revive the economy. Local Congress approved a loan of 2,600 million pesos. No debt gains were recorded in November, no state economy sector.
Response
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government, Maria Lópeze Valdése, pointed out the lack of government management capabilities.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that there was no convergence of the will of the individual sectors in 2011, including the government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa has been really inconceivable during this year. We need to work intensively to get back the land that we lost this year. In 2012, we need to redouble our efforts, there was a lack of harmonisation of our efforts, especially the proper and synchronized functioning of this new government. Let us hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowdown
Loredo López said that events like frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to reintroduce the dynamics that would allow for an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. Therefore, at the end of the year we found ourselves deep below the expected forecasts," he said.
Re-definition of the mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriarte, President of the Mexican Confederation's Confederation in Sinaloa, it is necessary to push the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"We generally observe that work is being done. We believe that a long-term plan needs to be prepared in which the objectives and economic orientation of the state should be redefined, because it is important to mobilise all the potential of the material and human resources Sinaloa has," he said.
The Work That Is Before Us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that would better drive the government's efforts.
"I would normally say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, in the area of economic development there have been some progress, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He said that the current administration has shown progress in public policy management.
"There are elements that make it possible to claim that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is to be work done here, and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Condemned for 8 kg of marijuana
The resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for holding eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of a crime of endangering health, specifically for holding marijuana for business purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the Mexican army on 7 June 2010 on a footing in Cipriano Valdez, opposite station 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
Dealer drove in a truck type pick up the white color. In the car in the shelf he had a black bag and on the passenger seat a small backpack. Soldiers found 8 kg 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured man remained available to the Judge of the Second Division and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Impact of Crimes.
Debt of project contributions
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as the Habitat, the Rescue of Public Places and 3x1 for migrants, face the danger that they will not be reached to the end or that they will be greatly delayed due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel Ágel López Miranda said.
The director of urban social development said that if construction works had gone forward so far, it is now threatened that the government will not be able to provide the relevant supplies requiring more than 11 million pesos per three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos. The state is 25%. By now only the Federation and the city have added funds to work, so it is possible that projects will be delayed.
"They have to provide almost 12 million, and although the year is almost over, we have got nothing at all. Even though we had to get some in July," he said. "To make sure that we don't waste time, we started projects and continue very well, but we do lack money."
He stated that last year, under the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the relevant supplies, and therefore at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan to pay more than 7 million which were not granted by the State administration.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six years because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes went on. In order to get to the mentioned programmes, we had to get the means to cover what did not end the state," he explained.
Despite the State’s commitment to the transfer of these resources, he stated that an application had been sent to Armando Villarreal, the Secretary of Administration and Finance to speed up the procedure and that the corresponding percentage had arrived as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to give us 12 million and even though the year is coming to an end, we haven't even got a dog yet."
The Court approves "end of analogue transmission" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court of State (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional action filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which seeks to speed up the so-called "off of analog signals" and to implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
The majority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued a decree listing the individual steps leading to the transition to Earth's digital television.
This result was rejected by the Senate because a qualified majority of eight votes had not been reached in order for the court to express itself to the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the said decree, which thus remained valid.
The motion for a judgment drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter which, according to the law, is reserved to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Coffet).
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted for the project.
With this argument both the Senate and the House of Representatives supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described therein, leading to the transition to digitisation.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the action brought by the House of Representatives without entering into a discussion on a proposal which also concerns Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his statement, the Prime Minister stated that he did not refer to the arguments of the proposal in the sense that a federal execution could not be structured through general standards of measures to prepare public administration.
"I don't think that even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority," and recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is subject to a federal execution which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The replacement of analog signals is one of the biggest changes the world has seen in recent years. It has to do with better use of radio spectrum, better quality signals and more channels.
It is believed that to delay the change would be to delay the benefits of digitisation, which requires decisions in the matter of public interest. Digitalisation does not only have a technical dimension, but "it also concerns economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he pointed out, these questions "require the operation of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It includes a range of competences which the Constitution entrusts to the government of the state".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to a digital system and had done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialized technical authorities.
He stated that it was not possible for the government to introduce an unconscionable decree, which to some extent interferes with the scope of the Congress's powers, into the area of administration of compliance with laws prepared by legislative powers.
In Michoacán they analyze the possibility of adding "voice per voice"
According to data published by PREP, the difference between the first and second seats in the governor's elections is less than 27 per cent. 879 out of 6074 polling stations have not been counted.
The possibility of adding "vote after vote" appeared in this year's elections in Michoacán, where, according to the figures published by the Programme for Preliminary Election Results (PREP), the difference between the first and second places in the governor's election was not 27 per cent, and the votes of 879 out of the total 6074 constituencies had not yet been counted.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Election Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that several days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a number of measures to harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán officially did not confirm his political constitution, nor his State Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act. The National Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was even in this election period, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel warned of their publication within the time limit set in the Law of the Official Journal that he had any objections against them.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of State (SCJN) settled the constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislative power and declared the head of state's vote in constitutional reform "free and illegal" because he has no right to "or approve or veto".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that, thanks to the approval of the relevant measures, it would be possible for the General Council of IEM to carry out a partial and overall census.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, will be possible under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no record of vote counting and calculation in the relevant box or is not available to the President; or if there is a mistake and a clear violation of the electoral results.
In addition, the overall recalculation of votes in all electoral urns will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the elections and the candidate in the second place is less or equal to one percentage point; whenever an express request by the representative of the party and/or coalition appears at the beginning of the session, which proposed the candidate in the second place.
A total recalculation of votes will also be possible when, after a proper census, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the second-place candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point and also whenever there is an express request from the political party whose candidate ended in the second place. In such a case, the voting packages for which partial counting has been made will be excluded.
It should be noted that in such a situation there is an election in Morelia, where according to PREP there is a difference between the first and second places of less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 polling stations have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinam, confirmed by the family.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday there will be a ceremony and a mass of breath.
According to the family, the Colonel's last wish was that his ashes be dispersed in the mountains of Zapalinam.
After receiving the highest honours in the accident, the Bacio Cortése family returned to the capital of Coahuila on board the plane of the Mexican Air Force. Family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
In the afternoon the ashes came to the chapel located in the class of Nazareth Ortiz Garza, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, which was organized by his former students from high school technology and members of the American football team, whom Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla and his wish was that his ashes be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinam. This is what he always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, pilot's sister.
According to her, the Colonel fulfilled all the wishes, he was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, a remarkable father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and joined the college of Collegeo del Aire in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always went to his dream to be a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davilo remembers him as a very good man, "just arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapan to promote his uncle, so he is convinced that he died in what he preferred in his life: flying.
They gave him one last good-bye.
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said good-bye to all the honours he had come to give up Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Technology High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled in both study and sports.
Bacio Cortés died in the last days after the helicopter that was driving fell. Also on board was the secretary of government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all officials of this state.
At 18:05, the remains of the saltilen native Bacio Cortés (crewed) arrived to be handed over by the funeral service to the Mexican Air Force under the direction of Major Jaime Martinez to the area where his family, his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies have been found on Cadery's NL ship.
A few hours before the search, the military representatives presented a media release of 11 persons detained in this area for organised crime crimes.
The bodies of three men murdered in various parts of the body and head were found on an abandoned ship of the village of Caderyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
It was found on a 1.5 km road from Cadereyt to Santiago, at the level of an area known as El Castillo.
People who were moving around in these places noticed that a house with beige-coffee fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, about three feet [three m] away, they noticed the corpse of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One person wore a sporty shirt of yellow and dark cotton pants and was not wearing shoes. Next to him was a man in a sport shirt with white stripes.
A few meters further there was a body of another person dressed in a red sports T-shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three lay face down.
According to the location data, all three people were probably killed elsewhere because no bullets were found.
The chateau fence found messages addressed by one group of organized crime the second, as well as a number of bullet marks, both on the site and on the door.
11 suspects were detained in Cadereyta.
The secretary of the National Defence presented 11 persons, including youth, who were members of the criminal group, who operated especially in the area of Cadereyta, which is associated with kidnapping, murder, persecution and illegal burial.
According to published information, 8 persons were detained in the Los Alveros colony on November 11th and were released.
Three properties and a mobile phone have been secured, confirming that they are members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
A further raid took place on 12 November at 6 p.m. Military personnel were visiting the Rancho Viejo area in Cadereyta when they noticed cars with no SPZ and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they searched and discovered one rifle, shell and 18 bullets.
Then, on the basis of these statements, on 13 November, about 14 hours, one of the accomplices in La Frauda was arrested.
They were charged with illegal burial in General Teran, China and Cadereyta municipalities.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that keeps this country above the brink of an economic catastrophe.
The appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that keeps this country above the brink of an economic disaster and which has put the entire euro area at risk.
The Presidential Palace issued a report declaring that Monti, appointed on Sunday, meets President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected that it will present the government with a complex majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti has announced that he will present to the President the results of his talks, which he conducted with the political parties in an effort to create a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti explicitly did not say that he would be able to create a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The framework is now well marked", he added.
Monti completed the process of creating a government in less than three days, much shorter than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has caused the debt to rise to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Montim must approve the firm package of austerity measures required by the European leaders, which will only make it possible to restore Italy's credulity.
The pressure on Monti has been put on him to hurry. Due to the instability of the markets, they exceeded interest from the Italian BTP bonds with a ten-year maturity of 7 percentage points, the level when Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian employers' organisation Confindustria, told reporters after meeting with Monti: "We said we would very much support this government".
We believe that this government is the last option for Italy to get out of this pressing situation.
Monti’s hope of success was greatly multiplied by the support of PDL Silvia Berlusconi, which forced the crisis on Saturday to resign.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," she told reporters Angelina Alphano, the secret of the centre-right side.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is important because up to this point, a number of its members have been opposed to the government with the technological majority of Monti.
Parliament's support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support in order to promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in this effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti started talks with political parties, unions and business groups, youth organisations and women on Monday.
The round of negotiations ends on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitan, who made it possible to react to the crisis very quickly.
After a brief decline at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would submit to the demis, the interest on Italian bonds had returned to the critical border, responding to uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would bring about a reconciliation of success.
Saving Italy, whose public debt amounts to EUR 1.8 billion, would be beyond the possibility of the current euro area financial reserves.
Monti has announced that his government should remain in power until the next elections planned for 2013 are in spite of the general forecasts it claims that politicians will only give him time to carry out reforms and then declare early elections.
Monti stated that he would like to incorporate policies in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to draw Italy out of the difficulties that the country has experienced because of financial pressure.
Political sources have stated that mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties complicates the attempt to integrate political personality and government.
Spaniards take part in international games more often than Costa Ricans
Out of 22 Spanish football players, ten exceed the limit of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of 22 eligible players reached the number 50 matches.
Huge contrast on the Costa Rica side, if we compare 22 players of both countries who met at a friendly match today at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While world and European champions, number one of the monthly FIFA ratings, have a wide range of class A cross-choice matches on their account, Costa Rica has only Michael Uman's defender, who has played 50 international matches as the only one.
This figure reached last Friday during the match against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernández stadium.
Spanish football players, who play in the Battle of the Stars and the powerful clubs of the English First League, have for over a year maintained intensive activity in league championships and home cups and high-level games within European Cups such as Champions League.
We also need to add experience from the national Spanish team in complicated European and world championship elimination matches.
On the contrary, Costa Rican players have very limited possibilities of foreign games in the area. For example, there is Concaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We can see that the largest number of foreign games from the Spanish team has a goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who made the last Saturday before England (loss 0-1 in London) at the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international matches.
Casillas will take a turn against Costa Rica today and win a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's key player, has 106 matches on his record.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week by UEFA along with other Spanish players who have hundreds of matches on their list. Among them already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and Central Attacker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The hundreds are approaching Charles Puyol with 97 matches.
Following Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fabregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and near Michaela Uman are moving left wing Junior Díaz with 48 matches and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Furthermore, only 5 overcame the limit of 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't even exceed 20.
While Nacho Morel has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Viktor Bolivar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
The best shot of Spain is David Villa with 50 goals followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side has the most hits Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in his tour on the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence
"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have waited for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures them that the opportunity to play Costa Rica is a dream come true.
That's what the bassist and the founding member of Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of the tour on the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20th.
This day he will be performing from 7:30 p.m. at the National Stadium along with the angel band The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a copy of the interview, which you will find on La Nación’s website.
For your Costa Rican supporters, it's a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The road to Costa Rica is also our dream that becomes reality.
In South and Central America, we barely had a second and we had a great experience.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're very happy to be able to bring you our music.
I ask because the group literally loves it here, fans experience these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your most touching supporters?
Thank you for standing with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry it took us so long.
Some people have been talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that make you feel more pressured?
Some of the biggest shows we've shown over the last 21 years have taken place in the horizon for several weeks.
We've performed some great shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that's how we got into the form of a concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to this concert.
We love this country, we love surfing, we like the jungle. For both activities Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have many friends of surfers, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends are going to surf Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico, and they're the best surfing places, and so we learned about Costa Rica, by means of people who love surfing.
If we take a look at your tours, you've prepared a huge show with lots of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we don't have any limitations that we can't do.
We will try to perform the best show with various compositions. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a good and varied repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes other songs, so it's hard to choose what songs we'll play every night.
When we have two three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played in a long time, we focus on them and we are also surprised, because we'll remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it already.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
You've been celebrating this tour for 20 years.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, I'm sure.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined that we'd be in one big rock band and that we'd stay in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much we have been given, and we are impressed that we can continue to play together.
We love each other, and we like to make music.
We're lucky to see the places we've always longed for.
We couldn't have gotten better.
What meant to you that you were an important part of the creation of the genre of grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, in which the greats themselves are represented.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when the movement comes from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time, a group is formed in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to come out of one city.
We're proud of it, and it's our honor to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we play with some of them.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are fortunate that these are all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement that was created in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to stick together and still have the same members after those years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) has joined us 13 years ago, which is already in itself a much longer time than the usual duration of the group.
I think, first of all, we're all lucky that we're still in this world, and second of all, the fact that we're always interested in each other.
We're all close friends, and that's why we've managed to open up musical paths that leave everyone enough freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, we appreciate each other's music, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship with the word fame was not easy. However, thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew older, it became easier and easier to find a balance.
We try not to travel too much because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you'll have to remember that you have to respect the music and what you gave it, and you can't let yourself be carried away by being famous rock stars, and neither of us ever really cared.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs, and at first it was something grand.
We had been a band for three years, and we never produced an album until after Andy died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at pictures, I remember Andy, how incredible he was, how I laughed with him. It was always a joy to work with him, to laugh, to talk about music or football and a lot more.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her so much.
The National Band of Las Robertas will be assigned to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as jumpers?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and we liked this group the most. That's why we're curious about what Las Robertas will offer alive and must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words of Yellow Ledbetter alive?
It's an Eda question, so I don't know.
He's singing it, and I think he's adding the first thing that comes after him.
Who's influencing you as a bass player?
A lot of people.
I'm the first to be attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them that I could talk all night about bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge, even though it's no longer fashionable?
I think we've always felt a little detached from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, I'll imagine groups that I referred to as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that were created at the same time. And if music is valid today, it's something great, because it's music that's worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever before.
At first, your music was slightly cloudy and is now more positive.
What's the difference?
That's interesting, because I have a feeling that in the new album there are a few songs that are easy to read, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very cloudy, though they may sound positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they're very dark songs.
I think if you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from a family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent this for me.
I also think that you can be a happy person and still do cloudy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was reinstated for medical tests
On Tuesday, former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital where he will be tested for muscle loss in the area of lower limbs by his medical doctor.
72 - year - old Fujimori, who spends 25 years in prison for violating human rights committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, which has caused him to operate four times and is under medical control at the moment.
Ambassador Alejandro Aguianga, who is his personal physician, told Canal N television station that Fujimori would undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases within three days to find out why he was in pain and why he was losing his powers in the lower limbs.
Aguianga said that, in his view, Fujimori could get mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not want mercy because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times because of the cancer of his tongue, dropped 18 kilograms, and other infirmities such as severe erosion gastritis, a cyst on his saliva, kidney stones, high pressure, and circulatory problems in his legs were added.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people who killed a murdering squadron of troops operating illegally in the first years of his reign.
Mujica visits Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. It aims to achieve an expansion of trade between the two nations and to address the political issues of the region.
Mujica meets with her Mexican counterpart, Felip Calderón on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of extensive meetings with the full representatives of politics, commerce and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan Presidential Office.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries," the Uruguayan Presidential Office published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy placed South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that would continue to remain in the tax havens would be excluded from the international community.
Mexico President of the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world. With the above-mentioned Latin American country, the Agreement on the Exchange of Information has been concluded since January this year to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has sought to specify fiscal exchange agreements with a view to getting out of the "black charter" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to which are countries that have not implemented all the required international tax cooperation standards.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have, since 2004, a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which has led to the strengthening of the exchange of goods between the two countries.
The bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from a pair of Bowser villains, but he has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to all shops around the world this month, has been created from the beginning to use all the characteristics offered by the portable Nintendo 3DS console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses is to work," said a journalist specializing in Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this medium", because until this moment successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The speaker Nintendo said that, apart from the fact that the picture is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you overcome this level, you can go to the "second round" on the levels of the game, which are more difficult this time.
In addition, users can choose the real time between "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome the various challenges and "do not succumb to optical lies".
This new Super Maria in 3D also assumes the return of the character to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo plays in notes to those who watch the saga and repeat a successful formula from previous parts. It is in that the installer of the bearded man will have to pass through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in motions, in the area, in disguises and also among enemies, Luigi's playful will also appear.
Colom approves the release of Portilla to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that steps had been taken on the issue of the release of former President Alfonso Portilla, who is to be answered by a conspiracy in the United States to launder $70 million.
This concludes the process, which was aimed at having Guatemala respond to the request of the northern country that requires Portilla's release so that it can judge him.
At the Colom press conference, he confirmed that his decision was in conformity with the independence of judicial and executive power and that he remembered that the criminal court had already ordered the issue.
He made sure that during his term of office, he "did not interfere" with the court decisions and allowed all the editions that got him on the table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be released for murder and serious injury to health and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Parades, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's move is a step of execution after all judicial and constitutional instances have been exhausted to lead the trial against the former president who ruled between 2000 and 2004.
Pursuant to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found innocent in the case of embezzlement of 120 million at the Ministry of Defence at the time of his presidency. This trial preceded the release, but the Public Ministry called off and returned the case to play.
Trinijo helped 6,000 young people in danger
The organization was created to help children without education so as not to move at the edge of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the organization’s social support for Trinijo is very important: 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion have been helped, and the organization has been helping them to overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
In addition, it is necessary to add to the hundreds of jobs that have been acquired for this social group.
Last year's anniversary also served to present a balance sheet under the festive act that took place in the former production premises of the factory Fabra and Coats, which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinitat Vella was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, no work, drug addiction or social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andre took part in a large number of representatives of organisations and institutions that have cooperated with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the uniform nature of Trinijo's work.
Along with President Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the festive act of former socialist education adviser Ernest Maragall, and former Mayor and current Environmental-Social Councillor Richard Goma.
The present advisors for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Clearies, and the Director-General of Social Work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also arrived at the large Fabra and Coats Hall.
Mas said that Trinijo was created at a very difficult time and that today also has many obstacles, but added that the work the Association has brought to this day "is a good foundation".
The president cited Trinijo as an example of how it can be combated by adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is not for this organization and for the work it does, nothing new," he said.
There was an eviction of the forbidden house, where the giant parties were held.
Intruders owned 11 out of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 invaders left the house yesterday afternoon without resisting
It all points to the fact that the nightmare experienced by neighbors at 51, Balmes Street, is finally over.
Twelve people left the building yesterday at noon voluntarily, illegally inhabited and organized giant parties that woke the neighbors, abandoned the building by court order, without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation, a lock on the door was replaced to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," the warden said.
The occupations that took 11 out of 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - carried all the electrical and partly water equipment, also painted the walls and left all kinds of waste behind them, especially cans after alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties that lasted up to two days and awakened the other tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that while the building was occupied, the sales fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque emphasises that the occupation of the building made her unfairly competitive because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while at the discotheque it costs 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors because of the noise. However, the problems were not caused by the visitors to the discotheque, but by the residents of the seized house and especially by those who participated in organized parties, whose frequency and intensity had increased in recent weeks, according to the distraught inhabitants of the surrounding area.
The disco owner explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and for nine months she had been fired.
The city police also confirmed that in recent weeks they received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the PP city group at the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week, demanded that "the building be immediately relocated and thus ended the problems of civil co-existence suffered by neighbours and destruction of the area".
The president of the people explained that only one floor had been taken away before summer, but in recent months the invaders had reached all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and in one of them there had even been thefts.
In this respect, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be consistent when it comes to actions against civil responsibility that occurred in the building".
Yesterday, city police also cleaned out the building in Nou Barris.
At 15 hours, 30 minutes, the police got into building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being summoned by neighbors who saw four people enter the building.
All four of them were immediately detained.
The park or the mountains?
Architects met on the occasion of a process that brings with it more than controversy about fees
The city's 16-gate tender opens again the debate on the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80s, at the time of the biggest boom corporate Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this government printed several pamphlets to support the Collserola Park.
The plane defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with the New York Central Park.
After the CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many like the Barcelona upper boundary. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not focus on the north-south axis, but up (the mountain) - down (the sea).
The qualification of Collseroly as a natural park goes this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with savages instead of Yogi bear.
This was the position until September, when the town hall declared a mega competition with 16 auditions for the same number of entrance gates to Collseroly.
Of course, the gate records the park's idea rather.
Either this or someone's trying to place a gate on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, from a purely organisational point of view and from a reflection on the city, this question becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already as sober a topic as when two members of this old caste chosen when meeting in the elevator hand in hand.
And it is this process that has caused one of the rare coincidences between what the three Barcelona architects and the pre-graduate university professors think.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayon: the selection procedure has its justification.
According to Roldan, after the question of the Gulf side began, "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain side", so Ildefense Cerda's speech about green apples was not touched to the end.
"We have to rely on the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex", declared the architect, for whom the name "gate to Collserola" carries "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as defining a zone where it is possible to operate".
Fashion, like Roland and Bayona with experience from the urbanist world, qualify the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
The danger arising from the "uncertainty presented today by the project of the public place" after the experience of the 1980s, which in the Forum had "its swan singing".
The first concern is the definition of the boundaries to be built.
"Something to define means to take another step," it is basically to move forward.
"It is necessary to keep in mind new urban and planning instruments, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster."
If we focus more on the question, Modol believes that the valley slope of Collserola can be "considered as a park", but the Barcelona part is not, for purely topographic reasons.
Modol also recalled that there was already work done by Patronat de Collserola, which "must not end up in the dump", although he welcomed the fact that the town hall offered his play that he would hit the project from "the first moment".
Moreover, it understands that the proximity of the mountains and the city is a kind of a pass that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "questions" that it should be this technical profile that will lead the multidisciplinary teams ("it is all about skill", it adds), which should be created: "The architects should only be instruments".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question given by the name of this game is complex, because the basis for the selection process lacks the global vision of Collserola: "There have been 16 selection procedures that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that would look at the area and see it as a whole".
This causes at least him to apply for all 16 tenders.
Otherwise, the project of a single gate may run into the concept and definition of the architect of the adjacent gate.
In his view, the council should guarantee that the zone immediately located over Ronda de Dalt should secure an entire area of equipment to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino pardoned Jonas Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days incarcerated, the legal official, Cadino Red, granted mercy to the Mayor of Monterey's brother in a process in which he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jonas Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after the lawful official of Casino Red granted him mercy before the Second Criminal Court in the district in question, which discussed the case of extortion, in which the brother of the mayor of Monterey was accused.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos on which Manuel Jonas had to ask him to pay for the economic quota to allow the town hall in Monterrey to operate illegally in the betting house.
After a public indictment, the State Prosecutor's Office initiated the prosecution of the brother of the mayor. On September 2nd, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then, after 4 hours spent in front of the Public Ministry Agent number 3 for property crimes, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the capital city of the state.
This site remained for 49 days after the second detention order was issued, and the agent of the Ministry of Public Affairs turned down the possibility of co-participating or organised crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the Cadereyt criminal court for suspected extortion of the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. However, only a few hours remained in prison with moderate supervision because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to remain in the city cells in San Nicolas de los Garza during the process.
On 25 October, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who stated that nearly two months after the investigation, sufficient evidence was collected to prove Jonas' guilt.
On Monday, the legal official of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, arrived with Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the Mayor's brother, and he will be able to return to freedom soon.
During the legal proceedings, the representative of the Ministry of Public Affairs assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gómez whether the damage had been corrected and who of the associates decided to grant mercy. However, the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain secret.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, the legal grace of Jonas Larrazábal is granted. In the process which he was brought against him no complaint can be lodged. Nor can it be requested to compensate the damage or punishment.
After re-examination with the legal authority around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton.
The Registrar of the Court, Jorge Yanez, arrived at the San Nicolas de los Garza prison to inform Jonas that he had been granted an official grace and his case was postponed to the archives.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Perez James presented details of the air accident, in which the secretary of governor Francisco Blake died, and seven others.
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results of an investigation of an accident in which Government Secretary Francisco Blake Mora was killed, and seven others showed that the helicopter had hit the ground in full force without the pilot having a chance to try for forced landing.
At the press conference Dionisio Pérez Jácome, the secretary for Communications and Transport, said that prior to the start of the flight, the pilot noted that air condition conditions allow for flights.
"The parts that appear indicate that the unit came several times in contact with the terrain, the wings were entangled in the tree branch 25 meters from where the unit lost the hull."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 persons and therefore met all requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he stated that no components were found on the ground on the basis of the impact investigation.
"The search found that the parts of the plane were not located elsewhere, so the plane hit the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, meeting all the requirements for the transport of persons.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The Registrar has made sure that it is most important to obtain the results as quickly as possible at the moment. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Assistance Services, announced that the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was moving at a high speed at the moment of impact and there was an accident in a soft uphill terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a routine flight operation," he said.
At the press conference, SCT representative Perez Jácome named six key points of investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the air standards, the flight was carried out in accordance with the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports state adequate start-up conditions, according to which the aircraft moves towards the border, between DF and Mexico, the apparent layers are cloudy at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that the dark crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca.
The location of the impact.
The collision coordinates and the final helicopter record from the radar are likely to match that there was no loss of control or flight trajectory before impact.
Dispersal of the rest of the aircraft in a restricted area:
The information that we have at present allows us to assume that the collision occurred on an equal trajectory and on the side.
The flight balance diagram indicates that at the time of the land impact, the helicopter was complete.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the scene of the accident that there was an explosion or a fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that several contacts with the mainland may have occurred.
During the field work, the rest of the plane was found at a height of up to 9200 feet above the sea, the terrain is considered to be from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show images that are likely to break down along the mentioned route.
The information provides elements that appear to suggest that the helicopter could have gotten into contact with the countries in several places.
After a thorough search in the vicinity of the accident, no remains of the helicopter were found in the territory that is larger than the area of destination, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in the condition when the helicopter was still intact.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has launched research on the gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to discover the gene responsible for obesity of children and adolescents.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to reveal the gene causing obesity in children and young people. Research called "Genetics of Obesity in Children and Youth" will enable you to obtain results on overweight.
In a report by the head of the Research Medical Unit in the field of biochemistry from the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Centre of the 21st Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team composed of doctors, nurses, nutrition experts and social workers had been set up.
The team relies on the support of specialists and students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Political Institute (IPN).
Involve in research can also be a wide public, whether or not authorized. People can come to participating IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where youth tests will be conducted every Saturday from 8 o'clock.
He stressed that research started at the Cuahtémoc Sports Centre (Mexico State) and since 8 October this activity has also been carried out at the Nezahualcóolt Sports Centre (East of the Mexican State).
As soon as data from 500 to 600 children are obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Centre (in the south of the Federal District) and eventually at the Morelos Sports Centre (north from the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the components and importance of genetics in terms of obesity development and to identify risk factors on Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day, celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim was to collect data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and the family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He pointed out that anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist area), blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin are determined, and genes are examined (they are trying to identify genes that are involved in child obesity).
Cruz López said that this research reflects the concerns of health professionals over the alarming rise in child weight.
'A health survey carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that only 77% and 47% of obesity in boys occurred in just six years, and 47% in girls. The dramatic increase also occurred in overweight', according to an IMSS expert.
He said that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is that the country's population differs from other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African, and this is reflected in genes responsible for diabetes and overweight.
He explained that generally the genetics of obesity is commonly explained as the inability to burn excess energy that we consume (calorie) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The investigator explained that the direct benefit of participants is that they will be given an overall assessment of the condition of children, thereby finding out whether they exhibit any known overweight or obesity.
He said that even the presence of dark color spatter (acanthosis) on the neck and forearms suggests that the individual will likely suffer from metabolic problems and prediabetic conditions.
The information is confidential so far, the doctors are handing it over to the parents in writing and explaining to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make in order to avoid their children’s disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary life-style which means a lack of daily physical activity, day-long exposure to television and the use of means of transport instead of walking at short distances.
Overweight is also caused by large calorie intake, it is a higher consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and a genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
In Asfalt, UNAM will not be crying
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, creates modified asphalts with polymers and creates a mixture with better functionality, independent of climate conditions and temperature
If it was to care for well-being, it would not be necessary to correct nearly 200 000 embankments after each rainy period in the Valle de México Metropolitan Region, said Rafael Herrera Najere, a scientist from the Faculty of Chemical (FQ) of UNAM, who added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt deposits were adequate, there would be a significant restriction of prayers, or even it would be possible to completely eliminate them.
In his lecture, the technological cause of pomegranates, which he carried out in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory under his direction develops modified polymer asphalts, which should produce a mixture of similar characteristics as asphalt, but also greater mechanical resistance, both at low and at high temperatures.
Herrera Najera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely hot climate, for example in some cities in the north of the country.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is a group of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with a large molecular mass called asphaltines, and other low molecular weights called maltenes. Together, they supply asphalt with a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic nature of asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, behaves like liquid, at 120 degrees high viscosity, and at 50 degrees it is almost stable, while at low temperatures asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperature, an expert on chemical engineering noted.
A scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México were covered with a flexible tile, consisting of six layers of materials, three of which were mixed with asphalt.
Among the highest layers is an asphalt cartridge, made up of small stones covered in asphalt and then compressed.
He stressed that every stone that forms the cartridge is filled with asphalt.
When passing cars or creating pressure, it is so possible that the forces in the board are well distributed.
If it were modified asphalt, it would be even better to disintegrate, a chemical engineer would assume.
He added that the last layer of the coat, made of fine stones, would be placed on the asphalt cartridge, also covered in asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with the vehicle rails, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt cartridge and must ensure the friction of the vehicle.
Since a heavy load will be exposed as part of the longing, the coat must have sufficient thickness and must be alert to the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind. In particular, water has a major impact on the functionality of the asphalt cartridge.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads in and it's hard to get out, it softens all the layers of the tiles and thus the formation of prunes.
He explained that during the formation of pomegranates the film is first ruined and then the asphalt cartridge is damaged. However, it is not at one moment, but it is a slow process that should be stopped at first signs using suitable maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of molds, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of board must correspond to the load of vehicles and must ensure that this load does not exceed.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that as far as asphalt is concerned, we still have a lot of work to do and research at the beginning. For example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries, allowing us to easily repair spillages without having to use high temperatures.
What was the lack of a Valle candidate to become the new Miss Colombia?
The analysis of the factors that contributed to the failure of Melina Ramírez Serna to obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle thus wins the 14th title of the first multimiss.
Once again, Valle del Cauca did not reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied that she was on the podium of the winners, winning a silver crown and a sherpa, on the basis of which she became the new multimiss of Colombia.
On the basis of the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico won the title of the 14th multi-mission. Melina joined the women of Valle del Cauca, who reached the winning crown, but were finally released by the first multiples. Among them are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Cataldo (2007), Stephanie Garre (Alu Alu 2008).
What was wrong?
The result is the defeat of the great favourite, which in all previous rounds showed that she had to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing became the Queen of Police and the most beautiful face of Joel de Volgue. These titles were achieved, for example, by Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who later took the title Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to appoint her only the First Multimiss is the fact that she did not convince her of her answer to the question, "Which book you liked most and why?" by Martin Murillo Gómez of Leamos.
The candidate replied to the question:
"I believe very much in the role of literature, I believe it is one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me most in my childhood was the "Little Prince", a very deep book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the worldwide literature that we should all know. And today I have a book with me from Irene Nemirovski, Russian author. It is a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
However, because of the term "culture" she did not like, and secondly, because the candidate did not explain what she had been noticed by the individual books mentioned.
After the festive ceremony, Melina declared that she was calm and happy with the result: "The world is wise what is to become will happen.
And you people, read it if you can.
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed her favorite position.
From the beginning, the Bogota journalist indicated that the candidate was the most popular, the most famous, and the one who took all the previous prizes (Oster’s Gastronomy Challenge, the public title for best art dress and Mother’s Queen) had aroused envy for other candidates, shaken the queen, who then burned her on the scene.
It was evident during the first presentation of swimsuits on Hilton Beach and during two exhibitions before the final coronation.
Even though she was radiant for both, she was aware that she lacked the strength and the fire that had shown the representatives from Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at the Canal RCN program, believes that Melinda's winning the title of the first multimiss confirms the fact that a candidate who wins the most titles does not eventually go with the queen's crown.
Plus, Valle's attitude towards the media has been rather unkind in recent days, and it hasn't paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Only on the edge, two days before the election, an international member of the jury, Lucy Doughty, said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In Miss Colombia's competition beauty is not enough in itself, there is also a need to see more than just physical beauty. It is important to focus on social feelings. It is important that candidates be involved in such projects before they enter the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that candidate Valle lost points due to her lack of background and fibrosis, which was apparent on her buttocks. This is completely contrary to the jury's verdict that elected her "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who is preparing the queen, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls here, but problems with fibrosis on her butt which, in my opinion, was not too significant, took her points until the last day.
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos believes that a relative of Valle has made a mistake when she has undergone several surgical procedures.
"Surgical interventions are fine, but they didn't do it in Valle.
The body was never its strong side and this is where it chose its tax."
Because of this award, which was awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Assembly, there was a cruel prediction that was fulfilled after the swimsuit show. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melina allowed him not to finally grant her the highest crown.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that Melina has launched today's year of reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions to which she will be named the National Competition itself.
However, it will be recorded in history as one of the queens who, despite the crushing success of Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
That was the work of Cali's resident, who identified the body of Alfonso Cana.
An expert on fingerprints from Cali came into history as a man who confirmed the death of "Alphons Cana".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, last year, an expert on fingerprints from CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the top leader Farc: "Alphonse Cana", by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven experts on fingerprints working for the CTI department, Eliazar González, a 21-year-old man working in the field of judicial research, was employed this week.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at the Chocó City Hall, where he often had to search for more than five days in the forest to get to a place where there were bodies that needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle, and after graduating from the courses, he specialized in fingerprinting. This science deals with the study of skin friction, hand and foot.
In the week when the operation against the said Alfonso Cane was carried out, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
Friday night he went to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he would have to identify two dead bodies and that he suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world. That is why they asked him to take the card with the fingerprints of Guillermo Leon Saenze (his real name).
However, when he came with the investigation team to the scene where the body was located, he didn't recognize him because of physical vision, and he looked completely different from the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a villager in a given area, no glasses, much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Along with a gallton magnifying glass, ink and transplanter, Eliazar began comparing the dactile records of the dead with the records of the card.
He wasn't disappointed in his eye. It was Alfonso Cano.
That very night, a man from Puerto Tejad was entrusted to the Secretary of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzoon, to confirm whether it was indeed Commander Farc.
Search stop
For a daktiloscope from Sijan de Cali, the recognition that Eliazar González has shown to President Juan Manuel Santos at a press conference of operational services against "Cano" is very important.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Daktiloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in the decision-making of crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people assist in investigating crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When caught, many delinquents present false documents or have no papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that in the event of injury, he had to remove a piece of the house wall because at this point the thief resisted to pull out a vault full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to get a complete handprint and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicions in the event of a murder.
A few days ago, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
On the basis of the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and that the print on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it can't be 100% confirmed that he was a real killer, it's obvious that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
The expert on fingerprints from the CTI explained that the articles "screw off with chemical or physical reactive substances".
When it appears, a transplanter or tape is used for their collection.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of delinquents, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are currently many Colombians whose data are nowhere to be found," said a CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI TV program.
Like everything that sparkles, it's not gold, not everything you touch, there's traces left.
However, if it can be used, appropriate comparisons shall be made.
"Growth" protesting in New York City
Hundreds of manifestors were struggling in Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to stay.
A large part of them waited for an order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the movement Obsati Wall Street provoked on Tuesday the representatives of New York as they tried to re-enter Manhattan, where they were taken from in the morning, and then tried to take over another New York park.
Hundreds of manifestors were struggling at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get to because of a court order allowing the "comforted" to come back to the scene. The second part of the movement responded to the clearing by taking the park north of the city where further detention took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will sit elsewhere and continue in the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through assemblies and peaceful manifestations," said one of the spokesmen of the Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray stated that the response of the "excited" to the eviction of the camp ordered by the mayor of New York himself, Michael Bloomberg, reached the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced eviction of the site and allowing the manifestos to continue to stand.
In addition, "comfort" took another park located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the land of a farce in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take their place, but then the police came and detained some manifesto. Bray didn't know the exact number, but he said he saw that the handcuffs were imposed on some journalists.
The organization assures us that several hundred people have settled on the ground, and a delegation of religious representatives has also come to express support and also to try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is private property, remains closed, pending a court hearing that should take place on Tuesday and during which the legality of early evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the displaced manifestos even distributed and handed out copies of the court order and even gave them to members who were guarding the square, which triggered "some small clashes", Bray, who condemned the fact that some police manifesto were beaten.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or using "the laws that were published after the ban started, or to prohibit the manifestors from accessing the park with shops or other places that they had previously used".
Mayor Bloomberg stated to the press that, in view of this court order, the city suspended the reopening of the public space and the manifesto indicated that local laws did not allow them to return to the tents and the packers.
The city's highest representative personally defended the early eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and joined because the manifesto "broken the law".
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the evacuation of the square because it was "a place where people did not protest but break the laws and in some cases hurt others" because "some businesses received threatening letters" and "neighbors feared the quality of their lives".
"Early clearing was shocking and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people," added the spokesman's movement, which accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
The representatives of the Ocupa Wall Street movement also said they were planning to organize a "big action" on Thursday in cooperation with community and union organisations to remind them of the two months after the protests.
Pamela Anderson will be representing Miss Maria on a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other important Canadians will appear in the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December
Canada's Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a swimmer in "Baywatch", a bunny in "Playboy", a wife of a year-old musician Tommy Lee, and now an actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show of Canadian television.
A private television station CTV announced today that Anderson, together with a singer of sentimental songs by Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, will appear in the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st and will embody Miss Maria.
Today, the CTV shows footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known for her online pornographic videos, appears with his ex-husband, the engine "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Leem, as the Virgin Mary in the doll representing Jesus.
As Joseph appeared on the scene Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as moderator for the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheena.
Krome Anderson and Peters will appear in a special Christmas broadcast of CTV by Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March, who is close to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé named America's Kim Kardashian at one of her New York concerts as a "chill."
Japan Returns to Life After a Ruined Earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to household consumption and thus ends the period of falls that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe the country has had to face since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government accounted for material losses of $300,000 million, a wound that is healing well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of the fall, the GDP value between July and September reached such a position that it was possible to turn the page definitively: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% per year.
The results of the second quarter - the tax year starts in March 2012 for Japan - also predicts the highest growth rate compared to the January to March 2010.
Recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machinery required to restore areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
Businesses increased their investment by 1.1%, spending by 0.9% compared to January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy stems solely from an impulse that forces us to use the crisis to make us stronger, or to rebuild infrastructures.
Japan has woken up, especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable has increased by 1% thanks to increased expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
Stigma yenu
Toky was committed to the internal market when yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "saving values" for investors fleeing the debt crisis from the euro area and from the worrying forecasts of the USA. It is a privilege, however, that is a great burden for export companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony credited their weak results in July to a course of yen in September.
While markets continue to be plagued by EU countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government is cautious.
"We have to pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of certain foreign economies, the impact of the flood in Thailand and the rapid increase in yen," the State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohis Furukawa said yesterday.
And really perspectives aren't encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) pointed out that most Member States showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts inflexibility in the world economy, has shown that the economy of the main powers is slowing down.
It dropped four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even got below the average of 100. It reached 99.13 points.
Athens once again spreads uncertainty
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment.
With fast and risky marginal guarantees and uncertainty that has taken over again, Greece is becoming increasingly entangled in a maze that leads to an exit from a major debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "conclusion" of the new Greek transitional government is more about the demands of Brussels than the true conviction of the political forces is beginning to confirm.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms, and that the 100-day period he received on his appointment would probably be short for their application, the chairman of the conservative New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, declared that the new austerity measures would in no way support and reiterated his request to write down new elections on the expected date of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the 26 October summit decision," Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow in a vote of confidence in the government.
A package with 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras does not in any way clarify doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have committed ourselves to nothing else."
The chairman of the conservatives went in his speech to the EU and the IMF a little bit far. These organisations are expected to unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs. At the same time, he said he would not support and sign any commitments regarding the implementation of austerity measures.
The European Commission, angered by the already impact of Papandreou's playing with the referendum, stressed yesterday that its demands are inexhaustible: it does not unlock any assistance unless the new government and the main parties sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika will return "very soon" to Athens and will act with the new government on what "needs to pay the sixth part" 8 billion.
There's only one thing left to do.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a significant position at global level in terms of microfinance".
The Queen of Sofia reminded yesterday that the country has become the second donor of the planet in the last two decades, as regards this cooperation instrument, whose essence is that "this is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is a tool based on trust in man".
The Queen opened the 5th World Microloans Summit in Valladoli yesterday, believing that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation "is absolutely necessary" in order to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the UN by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the targets to achieve a reduction of half the number of people living with less than one dollar a day, i.e. the amount set by the poverty threshold".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly", stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", to which these loans are intended in particular.
"We have achieved much already" and "many challenges are still ahead of us".
The summit on micro-loans should not only be a discussion forum, but also a platform to support "basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families had access to these financial services and 100 million families had reached the poverty line they currently live under.
The concept of micro-loans to Spain and other countries of the world was expanded after "a pioneer of Muhammad Yunus' ideas went on this trip," said the Queen, adding that it was "an act of justice and necessary recognition".
The father of this instrument described it as "a wonderful idealist who set out on the road to fighting poverty". She met his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet his loan policy directly on the spot.
Another was followed by this experience. The first world summit in Washington and another meeting such as in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006. "In all of these meetings, I was able to establish a constant development, explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned the title "head of the family", which she was given in Valladolid yesterday by the "movement of the poor".
The Queen of Sofia finished her performance by inviting participants to engage in discussions and search for solutions, allowing them to continue fighting poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez has declared solidarity "is an ethical imperative" to be followed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with the period of loquism, because this cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent a "serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty", and now more than ever before, governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criterion of solidarity and not allow solidarity to be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, micro-loans are one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The National Mystery for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on trusting the people to whom everyone else closes the door. The Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed the participants in the city, who "opens its gates to the spirit of solidarity, which is contagious".
The CDU proposes to elect a European President on the basis of general electoral law
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Congress was held on Monday, November 14th, in Lipsk, without serious difficulties for Chancellor and President Angela Merkel of the Christian Democratic Party.
The question of Europe's future for the programme was originally not, but it was only in the autumn, especially to be satisfied with the members of the parties who consider the government's policy today to the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow to the Italians as lax.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission put forward by the leadership was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were opposed and 10 delegations abstained.
Several minutes later, a very pro-European finance minister left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: the response to the crisis "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the Chancellor of Europe, the time for change has come.
This could be expressed by changes in the Treaty of Lisbon, allowing the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general electoral law "to give Europe one face".
In any case, this is one of the ideas of a proposal adopted by Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly it is unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: the United Kingdom is opposed, and the leaders of the CDU think that we will take the same position also by Nicolas Sarkozy.
But the direction is set.
Likewise, the delegates rejected, by a large majority, the proposal to assess the weight of each country in the European Central Bank's management, depending on the weight of its economy, which would likely result in the strengthening of Germany's weight.
A concern about calming the climate within her side, the Chancellor made several references to Konrád Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. She did not, however, try to obtain a convention talking about "small" European states or states that are in difficulty, willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal for Europe is one paragraph of the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
It's only indirect.
When she reminded me that just two hundred years ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does cheating represent incapacity?
After support, the UMP party and the government launch an offensive against incapacity.
On Tuesday, 15 December, Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux and will visit the Social Assistance Office, where he will speak on the topic repeated since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As a follow-up to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased rigour, but is not less clear from the perspective of the right presidential campaign, the right majority wants to focus on job incapacity.
First of all, because of budget savings, the government intends to impose a fourth day of incapacity on private sector employees before they start taking aid in sickness.
Clearly, without the company's consent, the employee who gets sick would lose four days' wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
Measures that risk causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring in 280 million euros.
As well as measures that would be accompanied by another symbolic measure: to give state employees one day of unpaid incapacity (until they have no incompetence compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of discussion, the right-wing majority also launches a topic of fraud, which is aimed at predators associated with incapacity.
"The controls will be much more extensive and additionally: if you are caught, you will return," Xavier Bertrand warned in an interview with the RTL station on Sunday 13 November.
Similarly, as in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about irregularities in working incapacity.
These have, in fact, been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and the political effort that brought their fruit.
The French are no longer sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance of maladie (CNAM State Health Insurance), more than €237 million of daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, in 2008 the daily allowances, with EUR 11.3 billion, represented 5% of health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternal contributions and labour injuries and 54% concerned labour incapacity, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
That is, only 2.5% of health costs.
According to Alma Consulting’s study, the French had an average disability of 14.5 days in 2010 compared to 17,8 days in 2009.
The average that hides some deviations: another poll published in 2007 on Monster.com's job opportunities pages showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees questioned replied that they had not chosen a day of incapacity.
Another study carried out this time by sickness insurance institutions points out that in 2010 37.8% of job incapacity was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% longer.
When compared to their European neighbours, French employees are no longer more prone to job incapacity than elsewhere.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the overall absence (for health reasons or not) was between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in Great Britain and 18% in the Netherlands.
Deception in working incapacity represents only a very small part of the work in black.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only small scales.
The extension of legislation since 2002 has caused systematic checks aimed at incapacity to work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM noted that 13.8% of the 285,000 performed due to short-term incapacity of "unauthorised or too long" controls, i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacity for more than 45 days, 11% of the cases "unadjusted or unauthorized" count on 1.2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169 000 "unauthorized" cases for several million employees who had incapacity.
The number that represents much less than the number expressing work in black.
According to MP Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this issue, this number would represent 9 to 15 billion euros missing in the year-to-year tax collection, i.e. more than the total amount of daily allowances and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue programme to restore its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke these words to Parliament and added that 100 days of unity given to his Government would not be enough to fulfil this task.
"In order to put our economy back on track, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget plan," the head of government announced when he announced on Wednesday his first public statement in the opening of the debate to vote on confidence in Parliament.
The application of the decisions taken on 27 October at the euro area summit will be the "primary task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the euro area is at play, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be "in the vicinity of 9%" of the gross domestic product from 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Justice rejects new austerity measures
Justice leader Antonis Samaras expressed his support on Monday with the measures already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but noted that his party is not committed to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hands for any new measures," Samaras stressed his meeting with the Members for his side of New Democracy.
We have agreed on the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economy and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU are not blocking the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without the written guarantee of all parties supporting the envisaged measures, said Antonis Samaras that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the committee of experts
According to the report of the Royal Canadian Society, Canadians have been denied death.
In matters of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Canadian society is living with the idea of resisting death.
Only 9% of Canadians really accept the possibility of talking to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and making decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society’s extensive report, involving six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This Commission recommends that the Government amend criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this choice appears necessary for a patient considered competent to make such a decision.
At the beginning, experts cite a recent survey by the independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created cultures in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts tell us the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die at home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die at the hospital.
This average applies to Canada as a whole, while in Québec, this is the highest number with 86% of the people who died in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicides, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that the criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicide does not change anything.
According to experts who have also falsified all countries where these approaches are legalised or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this criminalisation causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicides against persons who are inappropriate or disagreeable.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday, during teleconference, more than a number of cases of these premeditations just in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Eutanasia is also being carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians are prone to euthanasia
Let us recall that according to an investigation by Angus Reid in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already expressed themselves in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it will enable people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message that the lives of old or handicapped people are less valuable.
With regard to persons who practice assisted suicide, 41% of the persons questioned are of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear when it comes to maintaining or interrupting patient care, say the authors of the report.
They also propose in their list of recommendations that criminal law should state that the withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Commission of Experts also requires professional doctors to be trained to respect the rejection of treatment at the end of life without fear of prosecution.
In matters of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the matter of palliative or final silence already widely used in Canadian medical facilities, the Commission requires that it be considered no longer to be used to reduce physical pain, euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Exclusions of other experts
Some medical law experts have already made their remarks regarding the findings of the report of experts of the Royal Canadian Society.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a medical law specialist, qualified the position of experts-signators of the report as "extreme" because, inter alia, he did not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old could ask for help in committing suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who was studying the rhesum news yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also underlines that it looks like the authors of the report have put the autonomy of the person above all other values that make up the social front of society.
For in society, he says, there are warning signs and limitations.
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as "a manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, a member of the Royal Canadian Society herself, particularly doubts the date of the report on the absence of doubt in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the US state of Oregon.
King Jordan urges President Assad to resign
Damashek speaks of "complete"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The followers of Bashar al-Assad yesterday manifested before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures intensified on Syria, President Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists and speaks of the "complete" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, the countries neighbouring Syria, took an opinion in favour of President Assad's departure.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was the first ruler of the Arab state yesterday to call on President Bashar al-Assad to have about 40 civilians and members of the regime killed in Syria, "to surrender power".
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to demise, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for the new phase of Syrian political life," said King Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, in an interview for the BBC station.
For his part, Turkish diplomat chief Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that efforts to mediate Turkey's regime since the beginning of the year have not been crowned with success.
"Those who in the Middle East do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, pointing to neighbouring Syria, against which Turkey is applying increasingly hard lines.
The United States was pleased with the "strengthening a consensus against Assad and the unfair conduct of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"International Communities, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries such as Turkey are using a increasingly harsh tone towards repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, during this time 16 civilians and 19 members of the intermediate forces were killed in Deraa in southern Syria.
According to this NGO, two other civilians were killed "in shootings and concentrated shootings from heavy machine guns in the city of Jobar" in the Homs area.
At the press conference, however, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moualle estimated that the country "was on its way out of the crisis".
After all, he also responded livelyly to the decision of the League of Arab States to suspend Damascus's membership, which according to him is a "hazardous step".
Syria "will not bow", he added with assurance that "competments against Syria will not succeed".
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the membership is currently considering the League of Arab States "the mechanism for the protection of civilians" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also favors the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he believes is "paranoid".
The new Special Meeting of the League calls for tomorrow in Rabat to take an opinion on a plan to resolve the crisis which was decided on 2 December and in which the withdrawal of armies from the cities affected by disputes and the liberation of the imprisoned manifesto was assumed in particular.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered the Arab League's decision yesterday to be "missing", while China urged Syria to accept the crisis plan, while completely avoiding aid for any sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands Italian time and sacrifice
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has requested markets for a little time to form his team and start implementing a program that will contain the "sacred" in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday before meeting representatives of trade unions and employers today.
It should consist of relatively flexible cabinets composed of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke about an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the appointed Prime Minister.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask parliament by Friday to express confidence to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti presenting a small team of 12 ministers to President Giorgio Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented on the nervousness of the financial markets yesterday and asked for time.
In "democracy pays precise deadlines" with regard to the preparation of the government and its programme, he stressed and added that "it is certain that markets will be patient and understanding".
His appointment as president was welcomed from the outset, but concern arose again after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team, which includes technocrats in particular, even though he stressed that he would like to be admitted to it by "politicals".
He expressed the conviction that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranca Fini, the new government will have confidence in Parliament on Friday.
Mario Monti promised to act with extraordinary urgency after taking office and to make Italy a powerful member of Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's speaker stressed that "and with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its target of balanced budget in 2013 and calls for new tough measures.
Confindustry's head of business, Emma Marcegagli, who meets with Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy "because a country that does not show growth cannot meet the deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for his professional knowledge and independence, "professor" symbolising, according to the authors of the editorials, "the call for seriousness" and "the other Italians", represents for Italy "the moral change" after 17 years of "berlusconism".
The great unknown will be the time of his team's life.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections because Italy has to place government bonds for 200 billion euros by April 2012.
Soviet scientist aided Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop an atomic weapon detonator, US NGO specializing in nuclear risk reported on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is relying on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents that have escaped from this United Nations agency when it identifies a scientist.
Last week, the IAEA announced its "serious concern" about the "potential military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to the Institute of ISIS, a widely drawn document of IAEA, V. Danilenko (born 1934) should have worked for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet Military Research Centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where it was intended to produce synthetic diamonds by means of an explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, the centre had to leave to start a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company should have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he would then cooperate with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls "clear evidence that the development of Iran's detonation system" was based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked during a substantial part of his work career on this technology within the framework of the country's military nuclear programme, where it came from".
Anti-Muslim crimes and delinquency increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics published Monday, the number of crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by almost 50% between 2009 and 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% increase compared to 13% in violence against Catholics, 4% in crimes against Jews and 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" was very easy to raise in 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After the decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and delinquencys rise again," Human Rights First said, "the rise in anti-Muslim violence is particularly important," the organisation added in its communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," one of the leaders of Paul Legendre adds.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these criminals," he adds, and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports of "hate crimes".
"Hateful crime" in American federal law is an inheritance of civil rights times.
This law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence associated with race, colour, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and resembles more Facebook
The site providing microblogging services Twitter introduced on Monday changes in design to allow its users to observe the activities of followers, which somewhat resembles its services to Facebook.
New offers of "activity" and "name" allow you to better understand and directly know the activities of other persons who are watching you or persons whose answers ("tweets") you are watching.
This makes it possible to know whether they allow to monitor contributions, whether they are logged in to new accounts, whether they have their favourite contributions, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "in August on a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, AFP told Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive function, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for the repeated distribution of the contribution of someone else, follow-friday pour recommander de suvre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'uvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celei des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network users are immediately in their "tweets" different assessments of the importance of this innovation.
"It's useless, it takes a lot of places and it's too much like Facebook," @jemb123 says.
"The function of Activity will help me to monitor some elements of my Twitter," @danykronstrom sent.
Austria
writing of the Golden Rule on the Balanced Budget into the Constitution
On Tuesday, the government of a large coalition of social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided to enter a "golden rule" of budgetary policy into the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible reduction in Austria's rating by credit rating agencies (AAA).
It was the social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision at the conclusion of the ministerial council in a situation where the Austrian public debt is 74.6% high above the criteria of the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more every year on the interest rate," argued Multi-Officer and Foreign Minister Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria therefore follows the request of the euro area summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government strongly requested that by the end of 2012 the reduction of public deficits and the achievement of the balance of public accounts be entered in the Constitution or in the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, starting in 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be able to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the federal countries as well as municipalities will have to report a balanced budget.
The objective is to get the public debt under the 60% criterion laid down in the Maastricht Treaty in the 2020/21 horizon.
Strong only
Noda threatens new intervention on foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in foreign exchange markets if they were to continue to strengthen.
"We're going to hit, like we did last time, if we find out too much instability" in the exchange course of Jen, he explained to Senate Y. Nod.
On Tuesday, he only regained his historical values, which forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31st.
On that day, Tokyo sold only dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which only recently overcame the dollar record from 1945.
Since then, however, the purchases of investors have been regularly promoted, which they consider to be a "safe haven" in uncertain times of the global economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
On Tuesday, the dollar returned below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the 105 yen symbolic bar close to the levels which triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was worth about 120 yen and the euro was worth more than 160 yen.
This outbreak of the Japanese currency is damaging to island exports because it is jeopardizing the price of Made in Japan products and lowering the value of revenues obtained by Japanese companies from abroad when they are converted into domestic currency.
"Japan recovers" from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and the tsunami that devastated the Tohok region in the north-east of the country, stressed Y. Nod, who is afraid that this irritation will not yet be killed in the egg of a fragile recovery.
The third economic power of the world restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% in view of the previous quarter) for the first time in one year thanks to the survey of export growth and household consumption burdened by disaster.
But the Prime Minister felt that the high value did not reflect "Japan's national economy".
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Japanese Central Bank (BOJ) to launch its political and monetary council meeting on Tuesday to take all possible measures leading to the weakening of Jena.
However, the governor of this institution Hirohide Yamaguchi noted that BoJ had already taken "relevant measures" suggesting that no additional monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Institute for Emissions of Securities increased by 5,000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion) to purchase government purchases and increased to EUR 55,000 billion (EUR 519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts involved in the purchase of various securities in order to flood liquidity.
Eurozone:
rates are rising, storms are failing
The risk of the disease of the debt crisis continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth numbers in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
The European Stock Exchange continues to be alarmed by the stability of the eurozone today on Tuesday, 15 November, and falls into negative expectations.
In Paris at 10 o'clock, the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% at 3.064 points.
The Dax Index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"With the new tensions surrounding the revenue from the loans of the euro area countries, which are in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to produce only part of the recent profits."
"The nervous investors are just too aware of the risk of disease," explains Terry Pratt, broker of IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange was closing by 0.7%, which suffered because of market concerns about Europe's ability to cope with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes fixed on Europe and the shift will continue only in the narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stable," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoš Investment Management.
This relaunching of uncertainty about the eurozone's future will damage the currency itself, which continues on Tuesday in its decline.
The euro has been getting to the lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency has a value of $1.3570 at a decline of 0.4%.
According to currency brokers, after the CDU party, Chancellor Angela Merkel, at her congress, adopted a proposal Monday suggesting the possibility of withdrawing from the euro area for countries facing difficulties without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
Interest rates for loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very alarming level.
On Tuesday morning, Italy's ten-year bond yield reached 6.85% and the return of Spanish ten-year bonds was 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of the South European countries, but also in France, continue to boost market participants' concerns.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded that the markets be able to remedy the situation in Italy threatened by the poisoning caused by its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the application of the decisions taken on 27 October at the euro area summit would be the "primary task" of his government.
Spain is once again in the premeditated line of markets when elections to the House of Representatives take place in the country on Sunday.
The difference between the rates ("spread") between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain reached a new historical maximum.
In anticipation of the euro area growth-declaring numbers
Statistical figures say that France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter due mainly to household consumption, slightly better than expected growth by 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies of INSEE revised downwards in the second quarter to a decline of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And in truth, it's the fourth quarter that the economists are most concerned about.
For its part, Germany registered growth by 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11 o'clock, while the European Commission has just highlighted the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogma
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balances or emotions, it is an energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural for a election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and a place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development will lead to double the demand for electricity by 2050 if we don't want a significant part of the world population to get rid of important parts of life.
At the same time, there will be a need to address the lack of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity, while not forgetting the necessary need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, which is a topic that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident has no effect on any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
However, this is not the case with Belgium, which submits to its decision the need to find any other source capable of replacing itself, nor Switzerland, which considers it right to build only last-generation power plants.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some of the countries, continue to make determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by restoring the construction of one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island plant crash.
If a German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, the reality resists it.
Berlin's choice will be demonstrated by the exposure of electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, the sharp rise in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
Denmark's case deserves us to think about it.
The European champion is also one of the largest coal and gas consumers in wind power plants, among whom 30% of its electricity is collected, due to the irregularity of wind, which makes the emissions of CO2 and the prices of Danish electricity higher by 65%, or 50%, than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the volatility of our energy policy, our neighbors will pay our electricity bill by 40% more than they make to French households.
While in a globalised economy, energy costs represent a key factor in competitiveness and the guarantee of industrial maintenance in national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the most cheap electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would result in a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make an illusion of a beautiful declaration of the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The price that a large majority of the French refuse to pay, just as it is essentially not against this energy, as public opinion polls show.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has enabled the construction of a sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 adjacent jobs.
A large number of small and medium-sized enterprises creating jobs that cannot be transferred to the international markets are being led by the exporting industry.
If France had decided to leave the core, it would have sacrificed a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would have lost EUR 6 billion per year to export nuclear facilities and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to function for 60 years while the manufacturer's fall would be planned?
In solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magic source for energy generation, or that there is no devilish one.
The development of equipment producing low CO2 emissions and equipment using renewable energy sources carried out by the French industrial group Areva testifies to the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Nuclear Safety Authority, which conducts uncompromising and transparent oversight of existing nuclear power plants, as well as the construction of a new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of blood security.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
The only thing in Three Mile Island was in normal operating conditions and was left without human victims and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, drama caused the concepts of a reactor and an unforgivable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take lessons from this accident as it did with the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German authorities dealing with nuclear safety, operators and constructors is that the EPR reactor represents a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all interested parties wishing to build a nuclear power plant consider it to be an option, stopping its construction in Flamenville would be an excellent gift offered to competitors of the Areva Group and the EDF company and making the way out of the way to empower leading positions in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogma and machinery dominate the debate so crucial to our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
Immigration policies carried out for Nicolas Sarkozy have been criticised from different angles - police, courts and administrations of subordinated number policy, compatibility of this policy with the "country of human rights" status, which France boasts.
Recently, it was administrative harassment, the object of which was foreign students who became current when the Minister of Interior (see Libération of 23 May) declared that France "needs no foreign talents, desks and waitresses".
But so far, it's only been discussed at the corner of the economy.
It is necessary to say that there is quite a broad correlation between the left and the right in this area.
In 1976, Jacques Chirac gave the tone in his statement that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country where 2 million immigrant workers are" and on the left hand of Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "could not accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005 the fear of invasion of hordes of Polish plumbers in French territory was shared to the left.
In both camps, immigrants are perceived as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we tend to provide to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande restricts to banality, saying that common development will enable us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As Economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron have recalled in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptive People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Definition Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.): there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that immigrants accept.
Restricting immigration cripples growth and harms employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially the less qualified ones, and create pressure on lowering their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than understaffers for French employees by doing jobs in the understaffed sectors.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer places.
Positive impact on wages
Like a surgeon, he will have trouble working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions between French and migrants make immigrant arrivals have a positive impact on wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri therefore calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% would result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
It does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought about by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries on average of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that in Germany one immigrant will come at the age of 30 to bring a net contribution (receipt minus expenditure) of EUR 150000 in his entire life to public budgets.
Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his wish at the beginning of his mandate to come up with the missing percentage of growth "with prized teeth".
The said teeth used to disembowel immigrants had just the opposite effect.
Europe invents democracy, think about European democracy
Democracy is rare and also very fragile goods.
The European continent should remember this, although it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, during the 20th century the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, gulags, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some people may have believed that to definitely triumph over their enemies, democracy would be enough to make the choice and make it as direct as possible.
But it is known from Napoleon that it was easy to think.
General electoral law, although a condition of democracy is necessary, is not sufficient and can become a "repressive tool" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, department organization and power control, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been the same since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
The recognition of the error of the Greek referendum type yes-no will have the value of dual disclosure in this direction: revealing the need for a great return to political power, but also revealing the disturbing sense of its inability, its inadequacy.
These ambitions must be considered in order to overcome them.
It is true that the front lines of the democratic offensive have moved today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer firing in the right direction.
We can't get anything if we demand a number of national referendums organised according to necessity and disorganized.
A Bianca exposed to a European absolute monarch or a leap with tied feet into an empty nationalist depth: what a choice for a citizen!
No, we don't want guillotine knives, but a common, full, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would not know where to stop the calculation - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is a whole of Europe, which is faced with the dictatorship of markets and credit rating agencies, who suffer from their inability and lack of solidarity.
This is the whole of Europe, which is being humiliated on the international scene.
We are alarmed at the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is a whole Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its peoples.
The governance of the European democratic sovereignty project must be reinstated.
For only together will the Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, to rid themselves of the governments of the markets and to prepare the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will provide for a decision at European level that will not be able to be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise leading us to a disaster.
After we have long fought against this Socialist proposal and Jacques Delors, everyone today strongly demands the European economic government.
Be a beacon.
But thinking this without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, would be a new madness and a new blind alley.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To create a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" republicans.
The revolution could not have been enough in the interests of that.
This lesson continues.
We must build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This will only be possible by building Europe more politically democratic and truly European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Uncontact" chip cards spread
The optimistic atmosphere opens on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris's world chip card fair.
According to Eurosmart's office, 2011 should end by increasing the world's sales of cards with a microprocessor (bank cards, SIM cards) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most important feature is the non-contact technology segment, which allows you to pay in public transport or to handle purchases by just approaching the card to the reader.
This year should be sold worldwide 460 million chip cards against 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share should still increase (expected 580 million units) in 2012 and reach approximately 10% of the total market for chip cards (6,925 million cards).
After being long in the drag of the countries of the APEC, Europe is gaining ground in a non-contact pay.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are modest: 400,000 visa-free cards have been issued.
But big business chains work for two.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million non-contact passes MasterCards this year.
In order to rank a higher speed level, it is necessary for the banks to provide their clients with them from now on.
"Two large French companies have undertaken to distribute systematically in the future to their clients a touchless bank card," said Gérard Nebouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payments
But this is only the first stage of the future's payment: a mobile phone.
The technology NFC (Near Field Communication) is now equipped with only a small number of devices.
"It's too late."
"But their real growth should take place next year."
"For 2012, we estimate their sales worldwide to 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing for the front.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test carried out in Caen, which will last from December to June of next year.
Appliances of approximately 200 clients and employees will be equipped with a permit for non-contact payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société générale announced yesterday that she was preparing to introduce an offer allowing her clients to pay by mobile phone without touch.
The terrorist front ranges from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the ties between Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-term suspicion that there are alliances with the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algiers has "became certain of this from now on".
"The manner in which both organisations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a great co-operation between them," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridges.
After being abducted by AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocourt and Vincent Delory were to be killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers during the operation carried out by special French units.
In the pits after the attack, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
A terrorist axis
An analysis of the calls made leads to several persons in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian who has long been in Maidugura, a town in northern Nigeria, which is the Boko Haram cradle, and the other leads to a man who is said to be close to AQMI and a sect.
"It's progress, but we need to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active," said Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more evident in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which from now on include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same method of execution as devices used by AQMI.
Since then, the international community has developed pressure on Nigeria to consider the problems that Boko Haram has caused.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of enlightened mystics to be of little interest.
Fast Success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in Maydugura in 2002 around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, meaning "Western education is sin", approves the establishment of an Islamic Emirates on the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection has a rapid success.
The sect is politicising and requires strict observance of Islamic Shari law, while its followers start fighting against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars, and authorities.
In 2009, the followers of Boko Haram became extremely active and multiplied their attacks against police stations.
The government's reaction is, as usual, still the same.
The army surrounds the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of Mohammed Yusuf is captured and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has radicalized and abandoned its position in the north.
At Christmas 2010, Jos’s assassination, which kills 80 people, will be followed by another in the capital city of Abuja.
In June, it's back in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police headquarters during his first suicide attack.
And in August, the UN local office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, from now on concerns all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaeda of the Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and the Games and the Somalians from the Al-Shabab movement in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé, he said that France is in emergency and is ready to "deliver all information".
World According to Presidential Candidates
In matters concerning China, Iran, or Israel's aid, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are getting ahead in simplification and ignorance.
Can America, a weakened crisis, manage the world by means of simple or even simplistic thoughts?
In listening to presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have repeated loud statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which is a traditionally strong point of the republicans.
Often, unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran, or Israel’s aid are among them.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the Republican nomination race "Grand Old Party", threatened the occupation of the Chinese before the World Trade Organization and their accusations "for manipulating their currency", which is America's bearered topic of migration of all parts of its industry towards Asia.
Worse, if this must contain the start of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China, and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost shriveled into a position that "adjusts" emotions.
He demanded a hard but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who is in the last place in election estimates, remains unobservable.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions failed to succeed in stopping his nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll imprison Iran," he declared fanfaronic.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his duties to this partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, second best placed candidate, proves an embarrassing ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a sharp stand against the Chinese military threat because Beijing's trying to develop nuclear capabilities' - apparently unknown fact that China has owned an atomic weapon since 1964!
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and other candidates Michele Bachmann.
They are all far away from Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy in 2008.
Opposers of the current president say Reagan also had simple thoughts and yet won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the sudden departure of "boys" from Iraq, his excuses about Libya, and thus render him a weak label
But the attack isn't easy.
The population assesses President Obama's national security policy, which was removed by Ben Laden, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military interventions that lead to disruption.
And with arguments that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically, so that it is possible to resuscitate its leadership, Obama to a better place.
Nord Stream, new port of Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline connecting directly to Eastern Europe to Russia and running at the bottom of the Baltic Sea began to work.
It must supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including 4 of them Heads of State and Government, took part last Tuesday in the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that will connect directly between Russia and Germany under the sea.
Symbolically German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned together the controlling valve controlling Russian gas entry into the Western European network.
This new gas pipeline will start every year to Western Europe with 27,5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian gas with the first pipeline of 1,224 km connecting the region of Petrograd to the federal country of Mecklembursko-Pomorjany.
The second pipe, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will allow for the supply of a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, a quantity equal to the entire French consumption.
And it's already reminded of the possibility of building a third pipeline pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the early completion of this huge building is the character of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested the project.
Nord Stream will in fact allow the gas to be delivered directly to Germany without being driven by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries are losing some power: the possibility of pushing Russia with threats of shutting down access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed it most strongly when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet Pact", with an appeal to the Alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means saying it's a politically sensitive topic.
Western Europe gained greater confidence in its purchases through its support for this Russian project.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project has created rifts between Europeans from the east and west.
Russia has barely managed to enforce its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western states with high gas consumption, whose bearings are nearing their end.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us," François Fillon confirmed at the opening ceremony of this pipeline and demonstrated at what point the big gas contracts of things are both political and economic.
All of this explains the wide smiles of the leaders of Gazprom present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
Submarine pipes are made of steel fitted with concrete cloaks to protect against anchors of seagoing vessels.
It consists of an average depth of 200 m at the bottom of the sea.
Its construction had to be avoided by minefields from World War II.
"For safety, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
Measures to protect fauna and flora had to be increased as well.
The pipe itself is a long metal hose weighing as 242 Eiffelworks, which is nowhere to be interrupted by valves or maintenance stations throughout its length.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project leader rejected it when the Swedes were only a little eager to see Russia's state society, as it permanently settled on their coast.
"In the event of a malfunction, we will stop the gas flow in less than 1 minute", says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the pipeline shall escape into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, because the welding was designed to create intrusion once every 100,000 years.
The external gas control is carried out by a submarine robot hauled by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This unit of cigar shape with a diameter of 1 metre is introduced inside the pipe and is pushed by gas.
The target shall be provided with accurate information on any deformation of metal parts throughout the three days of the journey at a speed of 3 m/s.
The next pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without having to make the slightest correction.
The gas circulation is simply secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar on start and 100 bar on target.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
The head of the position remains Gazprom, which holds 51%.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunia and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which was responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company has a headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased this company for five years through a contract which can be renewed, all its capacity for gas transport.
"Gazprom will have a profit from the total capacity, whatever the amount of actual gas delivered," says Jens Müller.
The financing of gas pipeline construction was ensured by 30% of shareholders and 70% of bank loans.
Total labour costs should reach 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez group, the investment costs went up to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be returned to them, because the only risk they take is Gazprom.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy coast with pine forests.
The valves of a height of 4,5 meters form an output gate of gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before being transported to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving 1 million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
When reaching full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - branded notepad
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to reassurance the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of candles.
Moleskine's notebook is easily distinguishable with its black rectangular plates and with its leaves white as if by age.
The journal Moleskine, as we know him today, was born in 1997.
At that time, the Italian firm Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides to place a new design but distinguished notebook on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is involved in the introduction of the new product.
The recorder is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (immatation of the skin), which is, for example, used to correct the surface of benches.
This type of notebook was highly appreciated by the writer and traveler.
"Moleskine has returned to the likeness of an old and forgotten subject which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century", says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leader of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to settle on 12.7 million pieces last year.
The situation is far from secret production in the first years when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to draw up an artificial portrait of the buyer, because the recorder will take on the businessman as well as a student or professional.
The image of the writer Moleskine is that his owners are cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded people.
A small Italian company, which had 12 employees at the beginning, now has almost a hundred of them, and since 2008, it has had two offices, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to the bookstore and through the FNAC chain of shops to small boutiques in the cities where he could assert his identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and this need for new writing, through the stormy development of e-mails," explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of the writer Moleskine: recently the brand opened the exhibition "Zacházka", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarn Film Festival, she also presented new records to a leopard-like writer.
Moleskine profits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifys its products: bags, diaries, pencils, bookcases ... The label extends to a whole range of carriers.
Success that sparked envy: in autumn 2006 Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe Investment Funds, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed disabled workers?
Around 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
Today it opens on the 15th week of employment of disabled people.
Despite the volunteer public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed disabled people is even twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the entire population.
Is it crippling?
"No, it is underlined by Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt Association, who organizes the Week for the employment of handicapped people."
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, there was not a percentage of the unemployed twice, but three times higher."
"Anyway, there's still a lot to do."
It should be said that for unemployed disabled persons, there are numerous obstacles to their entry into work.
These are older people: 37% are more than 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% have no diploma, and of 2.3 million students in higher education there are only 10,000 disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% of disabled people are 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria which make it particularly difficult to return to work and which constitute the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin Association, which was established in 1992 to help businesses receive disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There are still unspoken ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that the managers questioned had a "weak level of knowledge about handicapped persons" with "exceeding the idea of persons in a wheelchair and psychological or mental disabilities".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the goal of employing 6% of disabled workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures from 2008 give a status equal to 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, charged with collecting fees from businesses that do not comply with this law.
The number of "punished" enterprises is evidence, as is the amount paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 more guilty companies to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in big businesses."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "How lucky"
Before Tuesday night (20h45), French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard, and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly game would bring them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was a partnership between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the Courtyard Stade de France briefly and well Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the match against Turkey, a Belgian coach spoke only words of praise to his player.
"I am very pleased with Eden and his progress, and with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," assures French Lyll.
As for the difference between his performances in club games and national men's games, it's the same thing, it's justified."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my brand."
Gambling, which is being investigated against Romania on Thursday night for this fight against France, comes to the St. Denis Stadium to finally "light up".
There is no way to forget the term "joy".
Play against Bleus, who encouraged them from seven years of age and their winning hauls in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
That's more because they're opposite Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", reminds me.
"We crossed immediately."
"He can play against them, that's just pleasure!"
He kindly reminded Leekens of "the pride".
"Sacrifice" to fight "sacrifice."
"Grost" also stated in the quality of "neighbors", that France became a team of very high levels more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna".
"Laurent Blanc did a huge piece of work," he gasped.
Although Belgium will be missing at the next European championship, a technical football player would like to see in 2014 on a plane with the French... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great," he exclaimed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll realize it for the next fights," including against France.
Portugal very confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento launches the Bar against Bosnia Bosnia (22h00) with great optimism this Wednesday in Lisbon.
Both teams lacked realism on their way there.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt. Portugal's football team, with its steering wheel since 2010, qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal divides from happiness in fact 90 minutes.
There's only one match left and one match left - Bosnia.
With the knowledge of Friday's result (0-0) in the hell of Bosnian Zenica, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of supremacy, but it was not able to give him such a rare goal that would ease him.
"It's a good result, however, which contains a risk because we haven't scored outside."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will come before the audience, which should create a boiling boiler there, even though the game definitely appears to be "very balanced", says the optimist, but keenly thinking Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have the upper hand," said a 28-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being on Euro 2012," relativized follower Carlos Queiroza.
The indecisive Friday match in Bosnia forces Portugal to score and win.
An indecisive match can be enough for Bosnians who also need a goal.
"It's a good result, however, which contains a risk because we haven't scored outside," Bento regrets.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and which has players with great individual qualities", he added.
As in Zenica, Portugal will be interested in developing maximum pressure on the Bosnian team from the beginning so that "they don't give them time to think."
Good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
