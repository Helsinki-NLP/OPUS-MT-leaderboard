The Valiant's extra MPs are concerned about what looks like marines.
Some MPs do not understand why their deputation should become “member of the Wales Parliament”.
The MPs are out of business because of plans to change the name of the local assembly to the name "Parliament Wales".
The deputies of all political views believe it's some kind of trial.
One Labour MP said his colleagues were concerned that it rhymed with the words "stupid" and "stupid".
For readers outside Wales, twp means "stupid" in Welsh, and pwp means "stupid".
The delegate said that her group was completely dissatisfied with her and offered alternatives.
Valiant conservatives said their group was ready to discuss changing the name of the Assembly, but noted that it was a short famous transition from a member of the Welsh Parliament to a "marians".
In this context a Welsh letter is pronounced in the same way as a Yorkshire English pronunciation in.
The Assembly commission, which is currently drafting a draft law on the adoption of changes in title, has made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what the deputies of the Assembly call will, of course, be a question of the members themselves."
The Welsh Law of 2017 gives the Welsh East the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published a national consultation on proposals in which wide support was expressed for calling Parliament's meeting Wales.
With regard to the title of the extra MP, the commission preferred the Members of Parliament Wales or the HRI, but the option of the HRI received the greatest support in public consultation.
Additional deputies are obviously offering alternative options, but the way of reaching consensus may be a major pain for the chairman, Elin Jones, who is supposed to present a bill on changes over the course of a few weeks.
The reform commands will also include other changes to your work, such as the rules on how to disqualify additional deputies and changes in the committee system.
Additional deputies will hold a final vote on the question of what to call them when they are carrying out their task.
Macedonians vote in referendum on name change
Voters are voting Sunday for a change to the name of their country to or against the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The national vote was organised to resolve a long-standing issue with neighbouring Greece, which has its own area called Macedonia.
In Athens, they insisted for a long time that the name of their northern neighbour was a claim on their territory that prevented Macedonia's involvement and friendship in the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, the chairman of the referendum on name change, said he would not take part in the vote.
But the proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajav, say that changing names is just the cost of joining the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
St. Martin's Temple calls out, the Churches in Harlem fight for existence
"In the past, as the old people who I spoke to said, there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today neither here nor there any other."
He said that the disappearance of the fights was understandable.
"People have different relationships and backgrounds now," he said.
"The bar is no longer a cosy local guesthouse, where people go constantly."
As to the churches, he's concerned that the money from the sale didn't stop for as long a period as leaders awaited, and sooner or later they would return to where they started.
Churches, he added, can be replaced by living houses with candiments filled with people who will not help temples who will stay in the area.
"The vast majority of the inhabitants who buy candors in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so it'll speed up the day when these churches close together, because it's unlikely that the majority of the people who move into those candors will be the arrivals of these churches."
Both churches were built by the whites before Harlem became a black area – the Church of Constant Graduation in 1870, the Church of St. Martin – in the decade.
The original white meth system left in the 1930s.
The black government, which was praying around here, had the right to property on the building.
St. Martin's Church was captured by a black-minded public led by John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of traders on the main trade in Harlem 125th Street, where they refused to hire or promote black people.
The fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but the soldiers, under the direction of Uncle Johnson, planned a reconstruction: they introduced into the operation of the cartilage.
St. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, and his successor in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the Carillon “the poor. ”
The expert who played the rooster in the baton called it "Cultural Treasure" and "An Inreplaceable Historic Instrument".
An expert by Tiffany Ng of Michigan University also noted that it was the world's first carnion to play black-headed musician Dianysio A. Linde, who had moved 18 years ago to a larger church in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Meryveser said that St. Martin's Church didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's Church in the last few months was a complicated story between architects and traitors, some of which were attracted by false church leaders and others by the diocese.
The east of the monks, the governing organ of the chaplain's assistants, wrote in the diocese in the glues with the caution that the diocese "has tried to move expenses" to the east, although the east did not participate in the hiring of architects and subordinates sent by the diocese.
Some visitors complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was wounded during a daiving to catch lobbyists in California.
On Saturday, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who was hunting for lobbyists in California on the opening day of the hunting season of lobbyers.
The attack took place about seven o'clock in the morning at Bacon Beach, Enzynitas.
Chad Hemmel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he spent the morning with his friends diving for half an hour when he heard the boy shouting, asking for help, and then swam with the others to help him get out of the water.
At first he thought it was just excitement from catching the lobbies, but then he "found out that something bad had happened: 'I'm bitten!
I'm bitten!"
"The whole key was ripped open," said Hemel, adding that he noticed it when he came up to the boy.
I called out, "In the water next to the shark!" added Hamel.
The boy's been transported into the air to Reidy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he's in critical condition.
The diversity of sharks that attacked is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles' rescuer stated at the media briefing that the shark had been spotted at this place a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that it was a secure species.
Giles added that the injuries were sustained by the upper torso.
The officials closed down access to the beach from Pont Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Esinitas for 48 hours to investigate and to ensure safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks living in the area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's planning to move on to British beauty market
Sainsbury's going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening departments with beauty goods in universities where educated specialists will work.
Within a significant promotion to the British market of beauty with an abrasion of 2.8 billion pounds sterling, which continues to grow, while the volume of selling fashionable clothes and household goods decrease, the more large beauty houses will be represented in 11 salons throughout the country and also in other new salons next year, which will demonstrate success.
Investment in beauty comes because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill places on shelves that were previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and home goods.
Sainsbury's stated that double the volume of beauty goods by offering up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw, which will appear for the first time.
There is an existing Assertment from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in business departments like the one found in such stores as Boots.
Large stores also restart their box office at Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, and this turn is becoming increasingly needed among young buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop's perfume shop will test a concession in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened last week in Croydan in South London, and the second one opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham at the end of this year.
Shopping on the Internet and going to buy small quantities of products every day in local shops around the house leads to more efforts being made by the supermarket to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Kupey, Executive Director of Sainsbury's, said that trading points would become more and more like universities, because a network of supermarkets is trying to compete with Aldi, Lidl using a large number of services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's placed Argos' trading points in hundreds of stores, and also placed several Habitats points since two years ago acquired both networks, which, he said, contributed to the increase in food sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
Previous attempt by supermarkets to reconstruct their beauty departments and pharmacies failed.
Sainsbury's protested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the attempt to separate the revenue from apothecary stores ended after a series of analysis at supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's three years ago sold its apothecary business together with the 281 Celesio network owner Lloyds Pharmacy for 125 million pounds sterling.
It was stated that Lloyds played a role in this regard, expanding the assortment of luxurious brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our clients.
We also invested in teaching our employees how to offer their recommendations.
Our brand assortment is designed to take into account any needs, and the attractive setting and the comfortable location make us the best house of beauty to resist the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones dissembled after Holly Willoughby gave up the deal for £11 million.
Star Dragons Den Peter Jones dissipated after televising Holly Willowby gave up her business of 11 million pounds sterling from his brand, which specializes in image life to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
We don't have time for home brand goods and Truly accessories.
The business of the couple became like the brand of Guinea Peltrow Goop.
This morning 37-year-old leader announced in Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the star Dragon's Den Peter Jones, who is now splitting up with her profitable business of creating brandy clothes to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources show that Jones disintegrated when the gold-plated television girl confessed during a busy Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe (Bakinghamshire), that her new business deal at a cost of up to £1.5 million signifies that she will no longer have time to deal with the domestic goods and accessories of the Truly brand.
The business was like a brand Guinea Peltrow Goop and was increased twice to double Willowby's prosperity in 11 million pounds sterling.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced in Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK and headed to one of her own houses of rest.
Source is Truly being Holly's top priority.
This appeared to her to be a long-term future which she had seen in a couple of decades.
Her decision to refuse left all the participants absolutely bewildered.
Nobody wanted to believe what was happening on Tuesday, so soon had to start dinner.
Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.
Experts suggest that the care of the leading This Morning, who ranks among the most significant British stars, may cost a company of millions because of huge investment in various goods, ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and household goods, as well as from possible further delays in their livelihood.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of Traikh Willowby and Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Kepp, for ten years.
Willowby founded Truly & Capp in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined the presidency of the chairman in March.
The couple are resting together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television company.
Willowby will be representing the brand of M&S and replace Aunt McCartlin as the leading ITV "I'm A Significance".
Last night a source close to Jones said, "We won't stoop to his cause."
A sincere conversation that made us fall in love
He complained about the criticism he received from the media about his comments, which he considered "non-president" for being positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump much of what to deny?
Trump said in his paradoxical "dictoral" voices.
"I do not deny anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was announced by Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the talks on denuclearisation came into a standstill.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, a North Korean diplomat, Lee En Ho, declared to the world leader at the AAN General Assembly on Saturday that the United States had not yet waited for “the right ones” in response to the previous North Korea in the field of disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the US continued to use sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
The Trump took a much more optimistic position in its speech.
"We are very successful in building a story with the North Koreans," he said.
"It was all possible to end the war with the North Koreans.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we've got a good story."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: completion of missile trials, assistance in liberating hostages, and the return of the remains of American soldiers at home.
And he was protecting his unusual approach in talking to Kim.
"It will be very easy for the President to be there, but instead of 10,000 people trying to penetrate this crowded arena, we will already have about 200 people there," said Trump, pointing to a crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia devastated the islands and killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake at the Lamb in a foreign NGO, they said they were unnecessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the population of Lambok had been relocated, there was no national disaster that was a prerequisite for international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so it was a little difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
He wants the Save the Children Foundation and he's gathering a team to travel to Paul until he realizes whether or not they can work in the field.
Mr. Soutop, the representative of the National Disaster Management Agency, said that the Indonesian official figures estimate the situation in Paul to see if they will be allowed by the international agency to provide assistance.
Despite the earthquakes that always survive Indonesia, the country is still well prepared for the surprises of nature.
Though in Aceh they had built shelters, in other stocking villages they almost didn't have.
A apparent shortage of siren to warn about the tsunami in the field led to a greater number of victims, though a warning was there.
Even in better times, moving between many islands of Indonesia was a complex task.
And the congestive disasters made it difficult for the logic of movement.
The butler ship, which was placed on to. The earthquake victims' locker, is approaching Paul, but the path to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
The president, Joko Odod, set up a campaign to improve Indonesia's infrastructure and spend money on automobile roads and tracks.
But the lack of funding is being followed by Joko's administration, as next year's election will be over.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of inter-confession tensions in Indonesia, where representatives of the Muslim majority take on more conservative Islam.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
Look: Daniel Starryge of Liverpool pushes his ball away against Chelsea,
Daniel Staridge saved Liverpool from Chelsea's premier league game by comparing the 89th minute on Saturday to the London Stamford Bridge.

The attempt ended with the killing high under the top stall when the ball flew to the right upper corner of the network.
The ball was therefore flying over the head of the cap of Arisabalagi, which jumped, directly into the net.
"He was just trying to get into this position to kick the ball, and players like Shaq always tried to climb as far ahead as possible, so I was just trying to win us as much time as possible," said Starij at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that run Conté, made a light pass, not overthinking it, and just hit the ball."
Chelsea held 1:0 in the beginning of the second mystery after the Belgian star Edin Azar was killed 25 minutes later.
Attacking the blues at this match made the Mateo Kovacich pass before returning to the area of the peninsula and running into the middle of the Liverpool field.
The blacksmith quickly found himself in the middle of the field.
Then he struck an effective blow by handing the ball of Azar at the gate.
Azar circled the defense and broke into the lower left corner at the far pole of the mid-shipman Elisanne Becker, Liverpool.

The number of tsunami casualties in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths resulting from the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, reported Sunday mornings to the Agency for the Elimination of the Influence of Stable Disasters.
At a press conference, the representative of Sotopa Purvo Nugroha said that, according to messages, many people found themselves trapped in the ruins of buildings that had collapsed as a result of a 7.5-point earthquake that occurred on Friday, causing waves of altitude to rise to 7 meters.
The city of Paul, with more than 380,000 people, was inundated with the wreckage of the demolished buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed.
An investigation of the murder was started after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenheid, Merciaside.

The police spokesman confirmed that a woman whose body was found lived next to Birkenhed and was found in her own house.
This afternoon the women's friends came to the scene to ask me where it was found this morning.
The investigations continued, and the police said that they were in the process of informing the closest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson-Muse just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no one was allowed to come in or leave the building.

The Parliamentary statue of Cromwell became the last-century blow in the matter of “rewriting history”.
His removal would be poetic justice for his kind of Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatic Puritan followers.
"But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Scream's proposal as "stupidness" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the course of the present debates about the decommissioning of the statue, it was inevitable that the monument of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace will become an object of those actions.
The English civil war iconology was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps poor Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the preceding century.
The bright representation of Mr. William Hame Thorncroft about Cromwell is a testimony to the thought of the 19th century and to the part of the histography of the act which many think should be honored.
Mr. Goldsmith stated The Sunday Telegraph: "The crumbs of many have known since the end of the 19th century better than today, as a parliament defender of external pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Is it an entirely precise provision, subject to long historical debates.
There is no doubt that the 17th-century conflict formed the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure who represents one of the sides of this confrontation.
His achievements as a lord tracker also deserve to be marked and honored."
A murderer pig stung a Chinese farmer's death.
As local media reported, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in the market in southwestern China.
"The man known only by name, Yuan, was found dead with his arteries ripped and his blood spilled, next to the Leipzig in Guichów," the South China Post reported on Sunday.
The pigsman was preparing to introduce a pig vaccine in a pigsty on 30 May 2005 in Sinin, China's Tsinghai government.
He reportedly came along with his cousin on Wednesday with the neighbouring government of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the next pigsty opened.
He said that the pigsty had a large book with blood on its mouth.
According to the report, medical forensics confirmed that a 550-pound nod deflowered farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were covered and damaged,” said a cousin from the name Wu.
A video from the surveillance camera showed that Yuan went to the market on Thursday at 04:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Juana or to his cousin.
Market manager informed Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on anyone else, while police were collecting evidence at the scene of the event.
As for the messages, Juan's family and the administrator of the market, they speak in advance of compensation for his death.
Although pigs attack people, they're rare, but they've been around before.
Yes, in 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig weighed 650 pounds and pressed a Welsh farmer against its tractor and held it till his wife was afraid of the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten up by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a rollover.
'They're just playful.
They're yummy and very curious... they don't want to hurt anybody.
You just have to give them the right amount of respect," he said.
The remnants of the hurricane Rose will bring strong pouring rains to the Southwest of the United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weaker because it moves over more cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the coming days, Rose will bring about floods in northern Mexico and in the southwest of the United States.
Roses' speed, Hurricane 1 category, was 85 miles per hour at 5 o'clock in the morning for Eastern Time Sunday, and was fixed at 385 miles south west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rose is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, a low-pressure area that is moving east towards the western coast of the United States is beginning to form. On Monday, Rose is approaching the peninsula of Lower California as a tropical storm, and she starts pushing her deep trapeze to the north, southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will bring some parts of Mexico to 10 o'clock.
Then, the tropical humidity, which interacts with the coming low-pressure environment, will soon cause a strong tide in the southwest.
In places from 1 to 4 in successions, dangerous sudden floods, rural tides, and possible repaintments in the desert may occur.
The deep tropical humidity will cause the number of places to reach 2-3 inches an hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the northwest, particularly on the most part of the Arizona area, it is expected from two to four o'clock in the afternoon.
Due to grouped sections of tropical rains, a possible sudden flood is taking place subject to rapid deterioration in conditions.
It would be highly undesirable to go out into the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical rains.
A heavy rain can lead to a horse's being turned into a tempestuous river, and the rain will be accompanied by porous wind and dust.
The inspiring area of low pressure will be brought in by strong rain in parts of the South California coast.
Chance of total rainstorms more than half an inch can lead to a slight stream of garbage and make the roads slippery.
It will be the first summer in the rain season.
Some scattered tropical rains began to approach Arizona at the end of the Sunday and early Monday, before the rain would go all over at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread into the area of Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue for Wednesday.
And in October, you can see a lot of heat surges in the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics stay pretty warm.
Sometimes it leads to severe temperature changes in the near future.
There's a good example of a sudden temperature surge in the central United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Amahai, Nebraska, St. Louis, and De Moinem, Iowa, the temperature variance is almost 20 degrees.
For the next few days the long summer heat would try to gain strength and extend again.
It is expected that in many central and eastern U.S. states, warm October will begin at 80 degrees Fahrenheit [80 ° C.], from the South Plains to the Northeast.
New York temperature can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees high.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates the high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern part of the United States up to the first half of the October.
Over 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh listen.
Over 20 million people on six television networks saw interesting testimony Thursday in the Supreme Court in the case between Bret Cavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual violence that had taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political resistance continues, the parishors interrupted their regular programs to benefit the extraordinary news on Friday: the agreement developed by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flakek for the FBI: it consisted in conducting a week's investigation of charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Bureau that she was 100 percent sure that drunk Cavanaugh grabbed her and was trying to pull her clothes off at a dinner party at a senior school.
Kavan in his keen testimony said it 100% convinced that it wasn't.
Likely, more than 20.4 million people, whom Nielsen reported on Friday, looked at him.
The company calculated the average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data was not immediately available for other networks which showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And in Nielsen there are usually problems with the ratings of people watching TV in offices.
For comparison: Audio size is similar to Oscar's Play-of-the-Free game.
"The Fox News Channel, whose experts decisively supported Cavanaugh's appointment, guided all the networks on the average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day," said the Nielsen campaign.
ABC took a second place with 3.26 million viewers.
"CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million," Nielsen said.
The curiosity remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the main figure of the drama on Friday.
After the office of the moderate republican issued a statement that he would vote in support of Cavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when the protesters shouted at his address and when he was trying to get up on the elevator to listen to the Court Chamber.
He stood with empty eyes for a few minutes while he was barking, and it was broadcast lively on CNN.
'I'm standing right here in front of you,' said one woman.
'Do you think he speaks the true country?
He was told, "You have power, but a lot of women are deprived of it."
Flake said that his office published a statement, and reported before the elevator closed, that he still had something to say at the hearings in the committee.
All cable and rowing networks carried out a direct broadcast several hours after the Court Committee had to vote on the question of selecting a Kwan candidate at the Senate quorum.
But Flake said he'd do it, only knowing that the FBI would look at the charges against the candidate next week and that they would call on the minority Democrats.
Flake was convinced partly by his conversation with his friend, Senator Democrat Chris Kunsom.
After speaking with Kunst and several Senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had force because it was obvious that the Republicans would have no votes to confirm the Cowan without being investigated.
President Trump has begun an investigation into the charges against Kwan at the FBI.
Britain's Prime Minister May accuses the critics of "game of politics" because of Brixite
During an interview with Mr. Sunday Times, the Prime Minister, Mr. May, accused the critics of leaving the European Union as "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Tereza May arrived at the Canserative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In one of her interviews with her in the first post of the newspaper, she was former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, who spoke against her so-called "chuckling" plan for brexitis, claiming that the proposal for Britain and the EC to have the only fares was "very preposterous".

"That's what I always worry about," said Wade.
The volcano dumps ashes in Mexico
The ashes, which are being thrown up by the Popocatepetl volcano, have reached the southern regions of Mexico City.
The National Center for Warnings of Stylish Disasters on Saturday suggested that Mexicans stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and for 24 hours were registered with 183 cases of gas and ash.
In the centre there was audible rumble and a sense of jolt.
Images in social networks showed that around Mexico, such as Sachmilka, there are thin layers of papal flooring in a car windscreen.
Geophysics observed an increase in volcanic activity, which is located 45 miles (72 km) from the south-east of the steel after the 7.1 earthquake in the central part of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalonian separatists in front of voting year for independence
On Saturday, in Barcelona, six people were arrested after supporters of independence met with police on a public order, and thousands of others joined the demonstration in announcing the first anniversary of the polarization vote under the Catalonia department.
A group of specialists in masks that were held by the police in public order threw eggs at them and bloomed in peach paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets which are usually filled with tourists.
Later on the same day the fighting broke out when the police were using their clubs to keep the demonstrators out.
For several hours, a group of fights for independence scandals, "Don't forget, don't give up," were faced with those professional acts that shouted, "Living Spain."
In the messages of the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in the course of protest actions.
The tension in the region, which seeks independence, remains high a year after the 1 October referendum, which Madrid recognized as illegal, but which marked the separatist Catalonians.
selectors are mostly distant from independence, although voters are low, which is largely explained by the boycott of voting.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police attempted to stop voting in polling stations all over the region as a result of the actions of the angry demonstrators.
The groups in favour of independence spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the Spanish National Police.
The demonstration continued, but protestors were forced to follow another path.
The 68-year-old Narcissus Termes, an electrician who is present at a separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer looks forward to a prospect of independence for Catalonia.
"We have experienced one of the best moments of the summer.
I saw my parents crying for joy when they could vote, but now we're tired," he said.
Despite a vital but minor victory in the regional elections of December last year, the Catalonian parties that advocated independence were of all efforts to keep the momentum this year with many of their most famous leaders and found themselves either in voluntary exile, or in prison, awaiting trial for the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent announcement of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Jean Puch, who writes a protest in support of the police on the phone, said that the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting harder,” he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in the country since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections in the European Parliament next year.
"The selection as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to judge the regression of democratic values and reprisals we have ever seen by the Spanish government," he said.
London: Men arrested after beating their house into a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after their car had repeatedly confined to a London house.
The incident took place in the Bellinonard-Crest district on Thursday about 19:30 p.m. on British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said the gate and the building were damaged.
Maybe there was a bullet in the car at some point.
As a result of Meng's blow, Livingstone wins the Rangers 1–0.
Lingstan's first goal, Dolly Mangi, provided them with a victory
Livingstan's success came as a shock to Rangers, and it was time for Steven Gerard to be appointed after he had suffered several setbacks in 18 games in the Ibrox club manager's position.
The blow to Dolly Mengi was remarkable, as Harry Holt rose to one level with the Hibernian in the second Division.
Gerard's team won't win that season's run-in and meet the leaders, the Harts team, who are on their eight-point stand next Sunday.
In addition, Rangers in the League of Europe takes the Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
Livingstone, meanwhile, continued his win-win series on the air to six games, while chief coach Holt still feels a stalemate after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Skips Chances From Gross Visitors
The Holt team had to be warned long before they were killed, but that's the direction that called for trouble at Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but lost his chance to kill at the gate, after which Alan Littgo only managed to direct his efforts wider to meet Craig Halkett's blow.
The gentlemen were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could disturb the guests at some point.
And that's how the main goal was to be achieved.
A fine strike was taken from Rangers, and Livingstone made a debut, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson united to take over Mengu, who made the pass and killed him from the center of the field.
So far, Rangers has dominated it, but it turns out that the protection of the team is not good enough, and the Gateman Liam Kelly has been practically unattended.
It went on in the second half, though Alfred Marales really saved Callie.
The ball from Scott Pittman was bounced off by Alan McGregar's Rangers, and Litt's far from being on the second network of Livingstone.
The balls were constantly placed in the doorway of Livingstone and were bounced off, while the two penalty demands, after Halkett was summoned to replace Glen Middleton, and the demand for hand-punishment, were denied.
"Phenomena" from "Livengstan" – analysis
BBC Journalist Scotland Alesdeir Lomant on Arena Tony Macaroni
Phenomenal productivity and results for Livingstone.
For men they were wonderful, continuing to exceed expectations on this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and composition practically hasn't changed since their return to the higher echelon, but it's worth giving up the proper Holt for the way he's stimulated the team since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was grand, building a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worall all over the field.
Rangers was not inspired.
The nice things they were at Gerard's was when they didn't meet those standards.
In the last match, they didn't own the ball, just once, killing at the gate, which was something of a disturbing call to the Rangers, which ended up in the middle of the list.
Mixed treatment of Erdegano in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29th, smiles were visible and there was an unwarranted commotion when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of the disputed visit of President Erdagan to Germany, which is aimed at restoring the relationship between the NATO allies.
They argued over human rights issues, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EC.
Erdogan made his way to Cologne to open a new giant ball.
The largest number of Turkish people living in this town is outside Turkey.
The police saved themselves from taking precautions to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from getting together before the moon, but a lot of supporters were nearby to see their president.
Hundreds protesting Erdagan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their judgment, condemning both Erdagaan's politics and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Protests against and against reflect discords against a guest that some German Turks have declared a hero and some have condemned as an author.
DSF in Deptfard: The router died in a car collision
Thecyclist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place at the crossroads of the streets of Bestod Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, on the south east of town, about 10:15 B.C.
The driver's car stopped, the medics arrived, but a man died on the spot.
The crash took place a few months after another rover died as a result of a encounter at Childers Street, about a mile from the spot of Saturday's crash.
The permanent police said that their employees are working to identify the person and report to their closest relative.
Near that place were road gardens and bus stops, and the motorist was recommended to avoid this area.
Long-Larcin Tour: Six employees wounded during the riots
"Six foreign officials have been injured as a result of riots in prison under a strict regime for men," says the Penitentiary Correction.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin prison in Wooster about 09:30 B.C. on Sunday and continued until Sunday.
A special group, Tornado, was involved in the fight against riots involving eight prisoners on one wing.
At the scene of the incident, staff members were treated for minor injuries.
The Penitentiary Service spokesman said: "The specially trained tourist staff has been directed to combat those who have committed riots in Long Lartin prison.
Six employees were treated after receiving injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that guilt will be passed on to the police and they can spend more time behind bars."
The Long Larkin royal prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief was undergoing treatment in a hospital after the prisoner was attacked.
And last October, police officers on civil order were summoned to prison to deal with serious disturbances, during which staff members were subjected to an attack with swords for the water polo.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with strong floods (which could be useful for dry areas)
The tragic hurricanes are rare in Arizona, but that's exactly what might happen at the beginning of the next week, because there are traces of a hurricane called Rose in the south-west of the desert that pose a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already published on Monday and Tuesday data on sudden floods in Western Arizona and in southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern California and Yut, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that on Tuesday, Rose will go directly through Phoenix, approaching the rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or a fall of pressure within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
"Cathrina" (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border. "
The last model of the National Center of Hurricanes predicts a 2 to 4-inch drop, with a level of up to 6 in the Magalion area in Arizona.
In the other south-west regions of the desert, including the central rocky mountains and the Great Basyne, it's probably going to be between 1 and 2 inches, with a single yield of 4 inches.
For those outside the risk line of a sudden flood, Hurricane Rose could be long awaited because their region is suffering from drought.
While the flood is a very serious problem, some of these rains will probably be useful, as in the southwestern part of the world droughts are now observed.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Agency, at least a little over 40 percent of Arizona's territory is experiencing an extraordinary drought of another category," reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to a slowdown in Mexico's Lower California peninsula.
On Sunday morning, Rose still had a strong hurricane with a maximum wind of 85 miles an hour at 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles an hour at 12 miles an hour.
The storm will collide with more cold water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore it will subside.
Thus, it is expected that in Mexico, at the time of the tropical storm, there will be an exit of the river from the shores of the day or the evening on Monday.
There's a lot of precipitation in many parts of Mexico that can be strong, that can pose a significant risk of warming.
"There is a total of 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to north-west Senlara, where rains may occur to 10 inches," says weather.com.
Then the Rose will move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday as a tropical fall of pressure, which will then continue through Arizona and the southern part of Utah until Tuesday evening.
"The main danger is expected from the Rose or its remnants; it is a very strong rain in Lower California and in the northwest Sanora and Southwest deserts of the United States," said the National Center of Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and rural streams and delay in the mountainous region.
Four attempts of assassins' arrest at Midsomer Norton
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with a lot of live wounds in Summersett.
Three teenage boys were found wounded in Terrace Excelsior's district at Midsomer Norton about four o'clock on Saturday.
He was delivered to hospital, where he remained in "stable" condition.
"A 17-year-old boy and both others, 18 and 20 years old, were arrested at night in Redstock, Avon and Summersett," the police said.
The police turned to anyone who could have any evidence on the cell phone of what had happened to move on in their search.
"The coffee is abusing the power and anger of the Democratic Party," said Trump.
“The vote for Judge Kawano is the vote for the abolition of the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” said Trump on the rally in Villing, Eastern Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh is "pained by subversion and anger" by the Democratic Party in the process of his selection to post.
The coffee gave an indication in front of Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually raped her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also gave an indication during hearings about her accusation.
On Saturday the President stated that "Americans saw on this day a brilliant, quality and courageous character," Kavanaugh.
"The vote in favour of Judge Kawano is a vote for one of the most perfect experts in the field of law of our time, a lawyer with an excellent history of state service," he said, said a crowd of Western Virginia supporters.
The president sided with the Kavanaugh election to talk about the importance of Republicans in the interim elections.
"The five weeks left are up to one of the most important choices of our time.
I'm not just running out of time, I'm really late," he answered.
"That's why I fight everywhere for big candidates."
Tramp disagrees that the Democrats intend to "resist and prevent".
"It is expected that the first key procedural vote on the haystack level on the selection of Cavanaugh will take place not later than Friday," said CNN Senior Parliamentary Guidance Assistant.
Hundreds of people died as a result of the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia; the number of people affected is rising
"At least 384 people have died, many people have disappeared as a result of the flood of giant waves on the beaches when a violent earthquake and tsunami began on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi," the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Paul's town on Friday, when waves of heights of six feet (18 feet) fought about shores in the twilights, killing many to death and destroying everything in their path.
After the earthquake, 7.5 Magnitudes occurred.
"When there was a tsunami last night, people were still on the beach and didn't immediately escape, and they became victims," said the press secretary of the Indonesian agency, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, who, in Jakarta, said at the briefing yesterday.
"The tsunami was drawing cars, logs, houses, hitting all over the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (up to 497 miles/h) before the impact on the shoreline.
According to him, some people survived merely because they had climbed up trees to escape the tsunami.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to the 24th center of Paul.
The photos published by the horrendous disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were spinning and falling apart, and that the ball was surrounded by water.
The next pushes continued to rock the coastal town on Saturday.
There were 2.4 million people in the area who suffered from earthquakes.
In India's rating and use of technology (BPPT) stated that the energy generated by the severe earthquake on Friday is about 200 times higher than that of a nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to his data, the geography of the city, which is at the end of the long narrow cove, could increase the tsunami size.
Nugroha called the damage "wide" and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, trade centres and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the whole of some of the victims were found under the wreckage of broken buildings, adding that 540 people were wounded and 29 were missing.
"The victims and damage can be greater along the 300km coastline north of Paul, a region called Donghal, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter," said Nugroha.
Dongal's relationship "was completely damaged," said Nugroh.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," says the Red Cross statement, adding that its employees and volunteers have been targeted at the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could have been a lot worse," he said.
On Saturdays the agency was widely exposed for not reporting tsunamis in Paul but the officials said that the waves were coming at the time the warning was made.
In amateur images published in social networks, you can hear a man in the upper floor of a building crying out loud to people in the street about a coming tsunami.
In a few minutes a wall of water fell ashore, dragging about buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the withdrawn material.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a serious power cut-off that was disrupting communication around Paul, so it was hard for the authorities to recall rescue activities.
According to the authorities, the soldiers began directing cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other towns, but the evacuation was still highly needed for food and other items of the first necessity.
The city's airport was opened only for help and will be closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Odo planned to visit the evacuation centres in Paul.
As a result of the Indian tsunami, more than 800 people were killed.
That is very bad.
"While World Vision staff from Dunggala have made their way to Paul's city, where workers are hiding in brisents' hideouts set up in their offices' doors, on the road they have seen the scenes of desolation," said Mr. Dosebbe.
"They told me they had seen a lot of demolished houses," he said.
That is very bad.
Even when relief groups started sombre action to launch relief mechanisms in distress, some complained that foreign workers with deep news were prevented from going to Paul.
According to the Indonesian rule, finance, supply and personnel abroad can only begin to proceed if the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a press secretary of the Indian Red Cross.
After the government has declared, "Okay, this is a national catastrophe," we can open up for international assistance, but we don't have that status yet.
On the second night in Paul, after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, friends and family disappeared without news were hoped that their nearby marvels would be among those who would leave a futile gridline of condescending troubles.
On Saturday the little boy was released from the sewers.
Sunday the rescuers liberated a woman who had been under the rubble for two days, and next to her was a body of her child.
Hendon Subandon, a coach of the Indonesian National Paraplanism Team, prepared two of the missing parades for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including others who were trapped in Roa Roa hotel, were his students.
"As I grow older in paraplanism, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon told us how hours after news of the destruction of Roa Roa's hotel was spread among the paraplanes' communities, he desperately sent messages to whatsApp to the Pal who were at the beach festival.
His messages were nevertheless marked by a single grey branch, not a two-blue one.
"It means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while banking in Newport, Levi
"In the morning, on Friday, a thief stole $26,750 from an employee of Brink, who put money in a banknote in Newport, Liv, " reports the press release of the Newport Police Department.
"The manager of the machine dropped ATMs in a fun complex and was preparing to deliver more money," wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in release.
While he was busy, another man "ran out from behind Brink's employee" and stole his fur with the money assigned to the delivery.
According to the message, witnesses noticed a number of suspects who left the scene, but the police did not make up for the number of attendees in the incident.
Anyone who has information about them has to contact NYPD on the phone: 859-292-3680.
The rapper changes its name to Ye.
The rapper Keynee West changes its name to Ye.
When he announced a change of name to Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "I appear to be officially known as Kenny West."
West, who was 41, by the name of Ye, used this nickname as the name for his eighth album, which came out in June.
Changes took place just before his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to start his new Yandhi album.
He's replacing Ariane Grande's singer with a show that's been canceled for "emotional reasons," said the creator of the show.
On the other hand, as the current professional name West had previously said, this word has religious meaning for it.
I believe that "ye" is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it is "you," said West earlier this year, addressing the name of the album with the radio-led Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
It's gone from Keyney, which means "one," to just ye, reflecting our good, our bad, our loss, everything.
Album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's one of the most famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he was leaning towards the names of Love and Brother Love.
Former member of West's, Jai-Ze, had also done without contact and general letters.
AMLO in Mexico promise not to use an army against peaceful residents
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Abrador has never used military force against the population, since the country is approaching 50 years from the day of blood tests against students.
On Saturday, at the Tlatelolco Plaza Lopez Abrador's Square, "never use the military to bring down the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers shot a peaceful demonstration on the surface, resulting in the death of some 300 people, while the left student movements were being implanted throughout Latin America.
López Abrador claimed to support young Mexicans by issuing monthly grants to those learning, thereby opening up more free places in state universities.
"The unemployed and the lack of educational opportunities attract youth to criminal groups," he said.
U.S.A. needs to double funding for machine intelligence
"As China becomes more and more active in the area of machine intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this branch," says investor and specialist at Kai Fu Lee's computer intelligence, who worked in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after different parts of the U.S. government made statements about ME, even if the US doesn't have a formal MI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China submitted its plan: By 2030, it was trying to be the first one in the field of MI innovation.
"It would be a good start to a double the budget for research in my area, given that all the other countries are behind the US, and we look forward to the next breakthrough in the Ml's area," said Lee.
"Financing can double the probability that the next great achievement of MI will be achieved in the United States," said Lee at CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "The Powers of Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houston Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the Synovation Ventures Company, which invested in one of the most famous MI companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie-Melan, he worked on a system of machine intelligence that beat the highest-ranking American player at Athela, and later he was the head of Microsoft Research and chairman of the Chinese division of Google in China.
Li recognised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as those in the Agency's advanced research project in the field of defence, and asked if there would be anything else to help identify the following stars.
"U.S. researchers often have a lot of work to do to get state grants," said Lee.
"It is not China that takes away academic leaders; it is a corporation," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have recently hired lights from universities to work on MIs.
Has stated that changing immigration policies can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
"I think that green cards should be offered automatically by a candidate in the MI field," he said.
China’s state council in July 2017 issued a plan to develop the next generation’s machine intelligence.
"The China National Science Foundation provides funding to people in educational institutions, similar to that of the National Science Fund and other state-owned organisations provide money for US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China below," said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Machine Intelligence to engage partners in industry and scientific circles, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on machine intelligence.
And this month, the Agency for the preliminary research project in the Defence field announced $2 billion worth of investment under the name AI Next.
As far as the National Science Organisation (NSF) is concerned, it now invests over 100 million dollars a year in research.
Meanwhile, the US mission, which had been trying to create the Commission's national security of machine intelligence, had not observed what had been going on for months.
Macedonians vote in favour of a referendum amending the country's name
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum to change their name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia" to allow them to resolve their ten-year dispute with Greece, which blocked applications for participation in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is in Macedonia, says that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on its territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EC.
In June both governments concluded a deal with the proposed new name, but nationalist officials say the changes undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Georgi Ivanov said he would not vote for the referendum, and the boycott company questioned whether there would be a 50 percent minimum voter turnout for the referendum.
The question of voting at the referendum is, "You are in favour of NATO and EC membership, with the adoption of an agreement with Greece."
Fans of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeuf, claim that it is a price worth paying for admission to bodies such as the EC and NATO Macedonia, one of the countries that has emerged from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, Skopje.
While this is not necessarily a legal force, a sufficient number of members of Parliament have said that they would take into account the results of the vote to make it decisive.
Renaming a name will take more than two sentences in the parliament.
The state Election Commission stated that no infringement messages had been reported for up to 1 hour in the day.
However, the figure was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to the vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old wrestler in Skopje City, Jose Tanewski.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zayev, his wife Zaritz and his son, Dusk, voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia, dedicated to changing the country's names, which opens the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
Before Parliament's building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarks, 54 years old, prepared a small scene and set up chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are NATO and EU, but we want a union with our heads raised, not through the service doors," said the Cowadarks.
"We are a poor country, but we have the honour.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev stated that NATO will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the overwhelming number will be "for," because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and the NATO," said the Loan after the vote.
He said that the result, yes, will be "a confirmation of our future."
In an survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, it is said that a referendum will take place between 30 and 43 percent of the voters who are below what is needed.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian television channel showed 57 per cent of respondents planning to vote Sunday.
Of those 70 percent said yes.
In order to succeed, it must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The referendum's failure will be the first serious blow on the policy of the transitional government since its arrival in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguera of the Manchester City is going to the gate through the whole "Britain" defense.
On Saturdays, Sergio Aguerre and Rahim Sterling solved the problem of defending themselves against the British, winning the Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For 65 minutes ago he easily did it.
Argentina's attacking has got a pass at the center of the field.
He raced between the three "Britain" defenses before striking into the open field.
Then Auguster found himself among four green shirts.
He walked round one defender and overthrew several more on the edge of the British field.
Then he pushed the pass onto the left flank, finding Sterling.

"Aguerra has some problems with his feet," said the journalist, head of the city of Pep Guardioll.
"We talked about how it played for 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We were lucky that he shot the goal at the same moment."
But it was Sirling who gave Skye Blues the initial advantage of fighting in Primer Liza.
This naked thing happened at 29th minute.
Aguerre received this ball in the British territory.
He sent a beautiful ball through the left flank to Leroy Sanne.

shaker wants to play picker against Rocky
After the Nationals were excluded from the play-of-play competition, there was no special reason to stage a new start.
But constantly competing Shercer hopes to take a hit on Sunday against Colorado Rocky, but only if there's still an impact on Rocky's play that remains in the leaders after one game with Los Angeles Dodgers in the Northwest.
The years have conquered, at least, a unique place with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still hoped to get their first title on the air.
"Even though we're playing just like that, at least we can deal with the situation, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with a crowd and another team will be made up so that the game will probably be on the highest level of all the people I've encountered this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?
The Nationals have not yet announced a start for a Sunday, but it is reported that they are inclined to give Sugar a ball in such a situation.
The daughter-in-law who was going to do her 34th start held a KPZ session on Thursday and will be on Sunday at regular rest.

Trump is speaking in Western Virginia
The President sided with the situation around his choice of Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court, speaking of the importance of being Republicans in an interim election.
"Everything we've done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones -- I'm not late, I'm really late, so I'm still fighting for big candidates," he said.
Tramp went on: "You see this terrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using whatever means are needed, you see, the field, the measure.
They don't care who they hurt who they have to beat to get power and control, it's what they want, it's power and control that we're not going to give them back."
In his words, the Democrats intend to "again and hinder."
'And you see it for the last four days,' he said, calling the Democrats 'evil, mean, nasty, and lying'.
He saved himself at the Senate Court Committee on the early recognition by the senator of the democratic group Diana Feinstein, who got a loud assessment from the audience.
'Do you remember her answer?
Do you want to save the current document?
Uh, what.
No, I don't expect -- it was a very bad nonverbal language -- the worst language I've ever seen."
The work is no longer the church's foundation.
It is impatience to those who express their opinion
When Activists Momentum in my local party voted in favour of hurting me, it hardly was a surprise.
After all, I'm the last member of Parliament in a series of Labour-based parties to be told that we're not welcome is anything to say what I think I am.
My colleagues from Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar turn because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship exposed me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
It's about the importance of economic policy, about national security, about Europe, about the irony of fate, in which Jeremy didn't agree with previous leaders.
In a meeting that was carried out on Friday by the Eastern Labour Party, they say, "we want these meetings to be substantive and proactive."
For most of my eight years as a local member of parliament from the Labour Party it was that meeting that had taken place on Friday.
Unfortunately, today in most meetings the tone is not such as the promise of "more kind, more soft" politicians was long forgotten if ever had been.
This is becoming more and more obvious to the Labour Party that different views are not being accepted, and every opinion is judged from the standpoint that it is acceptable for party direction or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, because of my former colleagues, whom I had previously believed to share the same political views, began to expect me to take a step back, and took a position that I would never mention -- in matters of national security or in the EU's single market.
Every time I speak in public, and it doesn't matter what I say, there's a thousand images in social networks that call for a re-election, condemning the politics of the centre, saying I'm not in the Leibarist Party anymore.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that it was more fortunate to me than to some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are generally political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who daily encounter a stream of sexual or racist extremities, but never avoid.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're not an organization anymore that comes up with different views and with each "uncertainty" movement or the party's election rules changing, it's getting narrower.
For the past two years, I have been given a lot of advice that has called on me not to fall in spirit, not to be so loud, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Leibarist 32 years ago as a school student misplaced by the Government of Tetcher, which has caused my student to fail at school, I have tried to maintain the best government services for those who are most in need -- let it be a local resident or a government minister.
I've never hidden my political views, including my past choices.
No one in East Nottingham could be entangled in my political positions and areas of conflict with current leadership.
For those who struggled for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that, when the country is headed for Brexit, which is causing damage to the household, the enterprise and our state services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my allegiance to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it's my voters, or it's going to be the members of the Labour Party, or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of re-election will be and the political purpose will not prevent me from acting in the interests of all of you.

Ir Melrose 38 - 17: Invincible Ir on top
The two conclusions of the attempt may have somewhat resounded the final result, but doubtless the Air deserved a triumph in this strangely interesting Tennet League match.
Now they're marking the tournament table, the only side of ten.
After all, it was their highest protection, just as their best chance, which made their masters, coach Peter Marchie had a full right to be satisfied.
"We have still tried our games so far, and we are still invincible; so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose said, "Give it up to Eira, he has ventured more than we do.
Grant Andersan's 14-minute attempt, turned by Frazier Klim, put Ira in the foreground, but the yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to juggle numbers, and Jason Baggot grabbed hold of an unrealized attempt.
The climate stretched out Air's leadership with a penalty, before, right at break, he killed, and then made a salt attempt, making 17-5 Air at break.
But Melrose well began the second half, and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, who had been turned by the Bahamas, reduced his salary to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious trauma of Ruard Nott, which was extended, and after the air had started again, it moved on through the attempt of Stafford McDowell, which was implemented by the climate.
Air, carrying out Captain Blair McPherson's duties, got a yellow card, and again Melrose made one more person pay with an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of February's pressure.
However, the masters came back, and when Stroan Hutchinson got the yellow card for throwing the airless ball out of the prison line, McFherson landed behind Eyre.
The climate realized its attempt to do again almost after the relaunch, after Kyle Roe got hit by David Armstrong in a fine and sent Gregor Henry's flanger to the fifth attempt at field masters.
Star Still Game seems to be ready for a new career in the restaurant business
However, the star of Ford Kieran's game is going to enter the hotel business industry after it turns out that it was appointed by the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show he writes, and he shoots together with a long-time comedy partner named Greg Hemphill.
Duet announced that the next nine series will become the last in the show series, and apparently Kernan is planning to move on after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source of Scottish Sun hinted that Kernan was hoping to take part in "a flourishing trade in Glasgow".
"Our Sea": Bolivia, which has no way out to sea, hopes that the court will again open the way to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling the La Paz military headquarters.
Civil buildings under the blue flag.
In naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the "Our Sea of Right" motto is drawn.
And re-establishing is our responsibility.
In all of Bolivia, which has no way out to sea, the memory of the shoreline lost by Chile in a bloody conflict from the resources of the 19th century, is still alive -- as well as the urge to sail again into the Pacific.
These hopes may have reached the peak in the past decade, as Bolivia is awaiting an international court decision on 1 October after five years of discussion.
"Balvia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course she is waiting for a positive result," said the Bolian diplomat Robert Calsadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the ISS decide on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in Gaza, after decades of intense talks, will support Bolivia's statement that Chile is obliged to give a speech about granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Eva Marales is the charismatic president of Bolivia who is facing a controversial re-election fight next year.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly take a decision for the benefit of Bolivia, and that will make little difference, even if it does.
The Central African Republic, based in the Netherlands, has no right to decide what is going on in Chile and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final arguments have been considered indicates that the case was “not complicated”, said the Chilean expert in international law, Paz Zarata.
And far from moving Bolivia's case, the last four years may have thrown it back.
"The law on access to the sea has been manipulated by the current Bolivian administration," said Sarat.
In her words, Marales' warring kicker lost its remaining Chilean benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but then holding the discussion would be very difficult.
Since 1962, the two countries have not been exchanged with ambassadors.
Former President Edward Radríguez Velce, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an exclusive opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of putting an end to 139 years of discord with mutual imagination," he said.
Calsadilla also denied that Marales, another of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime problem as a political stronghold.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"It's an option to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea declares that nuclear disarmament will not take place until they can trust the U.S.
Secretary of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ry Young Ho, says his country will never cease to use its nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
Ry spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly OF AAN.
He urged the United States to keep the promises reached during the summit in Singapore between the leaders.
His comments appear to be in the US. Secretary-General Mike Pampeo seems to be on the verge of restoring a nuclear dead end with a North Korean Kim Cheng Yen more than three months after Singapore.
Rye says it's a "unforgotten dream" in order to prolonged sanctions and U.S. objection to the declaration of the end of the war in Korea ever put the North on its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree with the declarant when Pyongyang first doesn't take significant steps to resolve it.
Both Kim and the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, are demanding a second summit.
But there's a great deal of skepticism as to what Pyongyang is seriously thinking about rejecting an arsenal that the country is probably considering as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pampea plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim Trump summit.
On Parisian fashion shows we saw the new line in massive headgear outfits on the way to shops in your towns.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or close the sun completely, you may no longer search.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented on the rise a number of unusual headgear outfits for their SS19 collection, which exceeded expectations from Paris Fashion Week.
With this summer on Instagram there was a collapse of unpractical hats, designers who sent their beings on the floor.
The spectacular figure of Valentino was a luxurious beige hat, ornamented with wide fields, similar to feathers, which filled the heads of models.
Other accessories of unusually large size included adorned with precious coffee-stones, a wizard's hat and even an pineapple, but they were not intended to keep their head warm.
In addition, Brown showed a collection of moody masks -- just up to Halloween.
Many of the coloring masks were with sewn-up lips and more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of them looked like a pebble for underwater swimming with pipes and protective sharks, and the other one was like a molten orange cone.
And if you continue to follow the fashion attributes very much, you're very lucky.
Those who follow the style predict that giant hats can break into our daily lives.
The giant hats follow the heels of the La Bomba, a straw hat with two feet wide poles, which can be seen in all, from Riana to Emily Rataikowski.
The round label on a very uncomfortable hat, which was spread out in social networks, contributed to another great creation on the floor--a straw beach bag, almost as big as a model with this bag, dressed as a buyer.
The dark-orange rapier bag, decorated with a rap sheet and covered with a white leather handle, has become an outstanding part of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection for Fashion Week in Paris.
Marked styler Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the main streets next summer, as the designer has exerted great influence, and it would be hard to ignore the demand for negative accessories."
Speaking is a necessary skill for all the world's citizens.
The independent schools of Scotland have kept track of academic achievements since 2018, with another excellent result from the examinations supported by individual and collective success in dispute, art, music and other beginnings of society.
More than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to provide a better level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education, their careers and their places as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can design and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands it stays in his head.
If you talk to him in his native language, it goes to his heart."
It's a vivid reminder that we can't rely on English only if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Of the latest exams this year, we see that languages take the first place in the league tables with the highest score in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages got a higher score of A.
Data collected in 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students reached a higher class A in Chinese, while 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish also reached Level A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland maintain foreign languages as vital skills, which are undoubtedly needed by children and young people in the future.
Language as a subject is now chosen as well as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in educational programs of independent schools and elsewhere.
An interview by the Commission in employment and skills of the United Kingdom in 2014 showed that, among the reasons why employers made it difficult to fill vacancies, 17 percent had been linked to a lack of language skills.
So more and more verbal skills are becoming necessary to prepare young people for their future career.
With more promising jobs that require knowing the language, these skills become necessary in a globalized world.
No matter what profession you learn another language, in the future, it becomes a real advantage if you have that skill for life.
You can directly contact people from other countries by automatically putting multiple people into the first place among competitors.
According to a survey by YouGov that took part in more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak good enough in foreign language to make conversation, and French was the only language that spoke ambiguous 15 percent.
That's why investment in language learning is now important for kids today.
There are several languages available, especially in developing countries, which will give children more chances of finding a good job.
In Scotland, every school will be different from the languages taught in it.
The classes will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in terms of the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, in independent schools there will always be a choice from a few languages to a teaching staff, which is specialists in this field.
Scotland's independent schools seek to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what happens in the future.
It is now impossible to deny that, in the global business environment of language, it is still vital for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as "the skills of international relations".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, the variety and preference for Scotland's youth.
It must be done
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts a Sunday in San Diego
Start waiting for supporters who want to see LeBron James make his first run at Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James is playing on a pre-seasonal opening Sunday against Danver Nagets in San Diego.
But how many minutes it will take, yet you have to specify.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at the Lakers official website.
Correspondent Lakers Mike Trudelle wrote that James is likely to be playing in a limited minute.
According to the practice this week, James was asked about his plans on "six pre-season graphs."
"I do not need pre-seasonal games at this stage of my career to prepare myself," he said.
Trump time in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight at Wiling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is launching a lot of company shares.
It's the first of the first of the five planned speeches of Trump next week, including stoppings in friendly places, Tennessee and Mississippi.
When the vote is confirmed on the arrival of the elections to fill the seat of the Supreme Court, Trump endeavours to reinforce the support of the immediate elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Kangres when the votes are cast on November.
When does Trump's performance begin tonight in Western Virginia, and how do we look at it online?
Trump's performance in Wiling, West Virginia, scheduled for 7 o'clock in the evening. ET Tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Trump's presentation on the Western Virginia Internet below on direct air on YouTube.
Trump is most likely at this week's hearings on his candidacy to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh, who is having trouble charging with sexual harassment with anticipated confirmation by the Senate of Voting for a week during the FBI's investigation.
But the main purpose of these statements is to help the Republicans, who are standing before the election in November.
Thus, President Trump's company announced that these five speakers next week were directed to "activate the activities of volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"The control over Kangres is so important to him in his order of day that the president will go to the maximum possible number of states, since we are entering a tense season of campaigning," declared the Reuters representative of Trump's company.
Planned on Wesbanco Arena in Willing, today's action can attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media," reports The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, when Trump visited West Virginia, in which he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Senate candidate from Western Virginia Patrick Morris, who is a leader in polls.
"It's not a very good sign for Morris that the President has to come to try to give him a push in interviews," said Reuters, a political scientist from the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder's Cube: The US team is pushing for a fight to keep hope alive on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions of the Saturday afternoon, perhaps it was just what Ryder's Cube needed for it.
A ping-pong pen that swings is a completely made-up, competitive concept that players can honestly believe in, and nothing more than similar competitions.
So where would they tell the momentum now?
"They had the advantage with six points, and now they had four, so I think we're going through it with a little momentum," said Jordan Sleep, spending the day.
The legacy of Europe is, of course, four points ahead, and twelve more in the game.
Americans, as Spitch says, feel that they have a slight lift in the wind, and they have something to look forward to, not least because of the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day, and everyone can brag about three points out of four.
Spit was mortal from T-shirts to green, and is an example.
These guttural shrieks of the celebration were getting louder by the length of his round, and he suffered a decisive blow to play in the four-field match when they and Thomas stepped two by two.
His blow, which allowed them to win the 15th match, was met by a similar scream, something which tells you that he believes the American team is not off.
"You just have to dig deep and worry about your own game," said Spiti.
Already gone, each one of these players.
18 holes to make a score.
In the last two days, the only players who have bought more points than Spite and Thomas are Francesca Malinars and Tommy Fleetwood, the inconclusive story of Cup Ryder.
There's four out of four wonderful but magical couples in Europe and there's nothing they can do.
"Mallowwood" was the only couple who did not make the gods on Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped the gods on Saturday mornings, Fridays and the afternoons on Fridays.
This is happening, and as their energy seems to flow to and from this turbulent crowd and from it, and it confirms that they are players who will win Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close the potential victory in Europe when the sun goes to Le Golf National than Fleetwood or the robins.
Both are wanted simultaneously on different holes.
The conversation of European fame remains untimely.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short work on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the early coach when he was paired with Alex Norean.
Boggie and two duchesses in the front nine dug out a Spaniard and a Swede from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your hole.
Behind the balls of four swords and fours so curiously observe because of the interaction between the formation of the couples, the advice they give, the advice they fail to carry out, and how the strategy may change at one moment.
Europe had become the best team and had taken on a significant role the last day, but at that fourth meeting it was also indicated that the United States team was trying to fight, in which some had doubted, especially in the United States.
Europe goes to the finals of Cuba Ryder with a number of 10-6
Europe will get a good head start on the last day of Cub of Ryder's Cub after it comes out of four football matches and a quarter with the advantage of 10-6 above the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesca Malinars set up a battle with two victories over Tiger Woods to take the score at Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, trying to save the trophy they had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, plunged into the American discontent agency in the morning, receiving a series of 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance to the four-ball match, winning two games, but they could not do more.
In order to save the trophy, Jim Fury's side needs eight points out of a 12 single matches a Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and he and the robin, who got the name Molliwood after a sensational sunrise, is the only second pair to win four points for their first four matches in the history of Cubka Ryder.
Having beaten Woods and Patrick Reed in four swords, they wonderfully braced themselves to defeat the abandoned Woods and the American recruit Brian Decombe another 5 and 4.
Woods, who held himself in two matches Saturday, showed a random flash of flash, but now he's lost 19 out of 29 times in a four-ball match, four-seven-seven-seven match.
Justin Roose, rested at the H-points of the Four Balls, went back to Henry Stanson's partner in the Four Balls-to-trafficking games of 2-1 Justin Johnson and Brooks Coepke, taking one and the other place in the world.
Europe had no way, though it was a pleasant, fresh day south of west of Paris.
On Saturday, the three-pronged champion of Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas set up a control point for Americans with two points.
They won 2 and 1 over John Ram and Ian Pulter from Spain in four games and came back later to beat Puller and Rory McElroy 4 and 3 in four, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of Cube Ryder's team came back from a four-point deficit, which goes alone, although Furika's owners only need to draw to keep track.
However, after the next two days, which were better, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if they're all going to get it.
North Korea says that "no way" will be disarmed in a single-sided order without trust
North Korea's Minister of Foreign Affairs said that on Saturday, the United Nations Organization continues to grant sanctions that reinforce mistrust to the United States, and in these circumstances, the country cannot refuse nuclear weapons in one-sided order.
Rye Yoon Ho announced at the World Body's Annual General Assembly that last year, North Korea, adopted “significant measures of goodwill”, such as halting nuclear and missile trials, decommissioning the nuclear testing zone and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see the right response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way in the first place to disarm yourself."
Despite the fact that Ri republished the usual North Korean complaints against Washington's "stepping" approach to the denuclearisation within which North Korea was rewarded, as it took steps, his statement turned out to be significant in the fact that he did not deny the one-sided announcement of denuclearisation that was made by the Pyongyangns in the past.
Ri rescued himself on Kim Cheng Yin and Donald Trump's joint statement at the first in the history of the US President-in-chief and North Korean leader's summit in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim pledged to work on the path to the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", making this Trump promise to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea is trying to officially end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington also supported the call for the lifting of harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States of America initially insists on "conclusion" and rising levels of pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced manner, and even oppose the "advertising the end of the war," says Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an unforgettable dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the head of the United States noted earlier this week in the United Nations Organization.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korea leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added, "If the participants in this topic of vagrancy were South Korea and not the United States, the Korean peninsula would not have become such a dupe."
However, Ri's tone of speech differed sharply from last year when he spoke to the A.N.A. General Assembly stated that targeting the U.S. continent using North Korea rockets was inevitable after Trump called Kim a suicide bomber.
This year at AN Trump, who last year threatened to "bring out" North Korea, praised Kim for his boldness in taking measures of resolution, but said that there would be much more to do and the sanctions must remain in force until that couple until the North African denuclearized.
On Wednesday Trump reported that he did not have a time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
The Chinese and Russia are arguing with the AAN, and the Security Council has said it's important to reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, Secretary of the United States. Mike Pompeii told the AAN Security Council on Thursday that "the execution of Security Council sanctions must continue actively and necessarily until we are sure of the complete, final and validated denullification."
The Security Council strengthened the sanctions against North Korea in 2006 by trying to stop financing the nuclear and ballistic missile programs of Pyongyang.
The General Assembly then stated that next month he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare for the next summit.
Pompey had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In glue he left Pyongyang, claiming that progress had been made with the North Korea for several hours of talks, finished his application for a visa that he posed the requirement of "like a gangsta".
Meeting with Munn this month, North Korea was committed to liquidating the missile installation and nuclear complex when the United States took “appropriate measures”.
Trump said that, according to Kim, "the right measures," which he was waiting for, were guaranteed security and an attempt to normalize relations with Washington, which Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard students are taking the right kind of vacation.
The new Harvard University course this year has got to teach students more to sleep, and it has a goal to fight the culture of learning coffee in hand at night.
The scientist concluded that students in one of the best universities in the world often do not know how to take proper care of themselves and of their health.
Charles Chaisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a hospital specialist named Brigham and a female hospital, developed a course which he thought was the first one in the U.S.
Inspired by the intervention of the lack of sleep on the teaching, he started a course.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, "Why did I get this from my last study?"
"She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep- -it surprised me," he said.
For the first time in a year, students have been trained to explain why good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting achievement, as well as to improve their common mood.
Paul Barreyre, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of health care at the university, said that the university had decided to take a course after finding that students were often deprived of sleep for a week.
A course that lasted an hour includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there's a picture of a room on the Internet where students press on to coffee, curtains and books that talk about the effects of coffee and light and how sleep deprivation affects sports talk and the importance of sleep habits.
At an early stage, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The map of the campus, with interactive images, invites members to think about their daily lives.
"We know that it doesn't change the behavior of students at once.
But we think they must know this as well as anyone knows the consequences of smoking for health," added Professor Chaisler.
In his words, the culture of night Eve still exists, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students leads to sleep deprivation, which is becoming an increasingly problematic problem.
"A well-established sleep of good quality must be a "secret weapon" of students to deal with stress, exhaustion and anxiety," he said, - even to avoid the excess weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain constantly hungry."
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian student who studies chemical and physical biology, assisted Professor Chaisler in developing the course.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to teach everyone on the campus.
He hopes the next step will be to complete the same program of study before going to university.
Professor Chaisler recommended that he be able to set a clock to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up, aware of the harmful effects of blue light, which is emitted from screens and light-headed lights that can change the solar mode, which causes problems with soaking.
"Livengstan" 1:0 "Rajers": Menga kills Gerard naked.
Rangers suffered another blow when Dolly Mengi's goal was to make sure that Stephen Gerard doesn't get a 1-0 in Livingstone Stadium.
Aibrax wishes to record his first victory on the way to triumph with a number 4-1 in February in St. John's, but the team of Harry Holtan bears the second chance of Gerard as manager of 18 games to leave eight points on his side, laging away from the leader of the Ladbrokes Hearts.
Menga was struck seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers team, inspired by the goal, did not seem to be suffering from a parasite.
At the same time as Rangers drops to the sixth place, Livingston rose to the third place, and then Hibernian remains with a difference in balls.
For the Rangers, there may be additional problems after Fort Colum Spence has had to deal with trauma after he's had the subject thrown out of the stands.
Gerard made eight changes to the player, making Ira not play in Half-Final Kubka Bethfred.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same lion under 11 rooms, which allowed for a pick-up from Hearts last week, and was delighted at how they well walked their opponents at every turn.
Rangers had a better hold on the ball, but Livingstone made more attempts to kill the ball.
They had to kill in two minutes when, for the first time, Mengi directed his ball through Scott Pittman to the gates of Alan McGregar, and then he used that chance.
The successful criminal blow by Jakobs Kagan fell in the wake of Craig Halkett, but his partner on Alan Lithg's defense was able to strike hard behind.
Rangers seized control, but at the last third of the game they were more hoping to kill than they were demonstrating a good game.
Alfred Marelas had certainly had to be punished by a fine of a quarter of an hour before the end when he and Stephen Loveles encountered him in the field, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not accept Colombian complaints.
Rangers managed to strike through the gate only in the first half of the game, but the former brother-in-law, Ibrox Liam Kelly, almost turned over Lasan Kulibali and the effective attack on Owi Ehari.
While killing the first goal at 34 minutes, Livi may have been against the next active game, but nobody refuses to demonstrate that they have to stand up for the good game.
The Rangers were unable to get through Jacobs' gate again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher gave a pass to Scott Robinson, who was blocking Menga from being able to kill at the gate.
Gerard replaced the Cupid's break at Ryan Kent, and it proved to be an effective influence when the attack made a breakthrough towards Marilos, but a formidable Kelly came upon and locked the punch.
But Livingston continued to please the visitors by playing that game they liked, and Littgo and Halkett continued to share the ball after a long resistance.
Holt's side could only carry on for the last few minutes, but MacGregor played well to resist Jacobs before Lithuania went on to catch the spares.
Rangers' replacement for Glenn Middleton happened the next time he was fined, when he ran into Jacobs, but Thompson managed to get away.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter.
A page from our almanac entitled "The Weekend Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and PADLIKA... the day of the future physicist Iagan Wilhelm Hans Geiger, born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which resulted in a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter became a part of science and appeared in pop culture, just like in the 1950 movie called Karanad, in which they appeared to have participated in the youthful teachings of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: who is he on earth?
Rogers: "It is the counter of Geiger that is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
And when you put in earphones, you really have the ability to hear the sounds of atoms that go radiatively in the minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, is this really shaking now?"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before the 63rd birthday.
But the inventions that bear his name continue to be used.
A new push-up vaccine can help your immune system to see the hand cells.
The new anti-cancer vaccine can help the immune system to see and destroy the bad cells.
It's like a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells that will be part of the cure.
The method involves getting immune cells from a patient and changing them into a laboratory.
Then the cells can "see" the proteins distributed in many hand cells and then re-introduction the helper cells.
The sample vaccine demonstrates successful results for patients with different cancers.
One woman who had introduced the vaccine, which helped the immune system to recognize the cancer cells, saw that the cell cancer had been disappearing for 18 months.
The method includes getting immune cells into a patient, changing them in the lab so they can "see" HER2, common to many cancer cells, and then reintroduce them again.
That's what Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer at Bethesian State of Maryland said, and our results show that there's a very promising vaccine.
"HER2 stimulates the growth of several species of anthrax cells that fight the cancer of the breast, the ovaries, the lungs, the lungs, and the large intestines," said Professor Berosofsky.
A similar approach to finding immune cells in patients and teaching them to reach the cancer cells was good at treating leukose.
Kanye West went on a discussion in Trump's support, carrying the title of the MAG, after it appeared in the SNL.
That didn't work out well.
In the studio, on Saturday evening, Kanye West was distraught after the speech where he was praising the United States. President Donald Trump said he would be running for second term in 2020.
After performing his third song in the evening called "The City of Previous", when he was in the cap "Make America Big Again", he spoke against the Democrats and confirmed his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to the whites, and they say, "How can you support Trump, he's growing?"
"Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America long ago," he said.
The SNL began to show with the main role of Matt Daiman, where the Hollywood star was concerned about Brett Cavanaugh's performances before the Senate court committee in the matter of the sexual violence committed by Christine Blasey Ford.
In spite of the fact that the speech was not broadcast, the words of Vesta crammed into frame and were loaded into a social media comic by Chris Rock.
I didn't realize whether Rock was trying to surprise himself with West.
Besides, West complained to the audience that he had a hard time behind the scenes.
They yelled at me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out there with that cap.
They were all over me.
"And then they say I'm in a bad place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner newspaper.
West went on, "Do you want to see the giblets of the place? "Tasuring that he" put on my cap of Scperman, that meant he couldn't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try to love.
Because of his statements, at least twice, they withdrew the hearings, and the SNA representatives were puzzled at the message from the Veraita. "All the study has shut down."
West was adopted as the replacement of Ariane Grande's singer, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMiller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of song I Love It, dressed in a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUSA party, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the bravest spirits Thank you for your support."
But leading the talk show, Karen Hunter wrote that West was just the one who he is, and it was always wonderful.
"But I've decided NOT to reward anyone by buying their music or their clothes, or by supporting their 'art', which I believe embraces and distorts the ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
Just as we are," she added.
Before the show rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name by stating that he is now "now officially called Keyney West."
He is not the first artist to have changed his name, and has gone after Diddi's footsteps, also known as Puff Diddi.
His colleague's rapper, Snoop Dogg, was called the collidants of Snoop Lion and, of course, the legend of the musician who changed his name to a character, and then he was also an artist, formerly known as Prince.
An attempt to kill at Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast attacked a second man on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihokamore, as police reported.
It is expected that the accused will appear on Monday in Belfast's court.
The prosecution will be considered by the State Prosecutor's Office.
Keith Harrington's star, the Superb Thrones, captured idealized brutality.
Keith Harrington is known for his swinging sword and John Snow's role in the series "The Crowds" in the battle of the medieval HBO raw material
But a 31-year-old actor did get the stereotype of a macho hero, which means that young boys often feel more cruel to respect.
Speaking in the Culture Department of the Sunday Times, Keith said he thought something had happened and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the #Metoo era.
Keith, who recently married his neighbor on the Top Throne, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted to having the strength to solve the problem.
"Do I feel personally strong--when did we get the courage wrong?" he said.
"Why will we teach men, when they grow up, from the standpoint of the attitude that we see now?"
Keith thinks that television should be responsible for the phenomenon of brutality because of very manly persons.
He continued, "What lies at the beginning, and why do they teach it?
Why teach on television and on the street, that makes young boys feel like they have to be so sure to be real people?
I think that's really one of the biggest questions that we've had in our time -- how are we going to change that?
Because it's obvious that something happens to young people.
In an interview he also admitted that next summer the show would end, and he would exit the field of battle-series and not make doqualls or seams to the "Top Thrones".
Since November, Keith has begun to give birth to a real Western Sam Shepherd, who is a historical director with his brother, who is a slave.
A recent actor has shown that he believes that meeting with his wife, Rose, is the best chance to end the throne game.
"I've met my wife in this series, so I've got my future family, and my life here," he said.
The rose was played by Ygritte, a character who is in love with the hero Kit John Snow in this fantasy series, awarded by Amy.
It was released in June 2018 at Leslie's mansion in Scotland.
HISTORY / AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to information provided by health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were registered.
Most of the new cases were transmitted through sex, as they were in the past.
Traditionally, HlV-infection is spread in some parts of China as a result of contamination through blood transfusions.
"But the number of such people who have contracted HlV-infection after transfusions has reduced to almost zero," said the Chinese officials at a conference in Yunnan law.
But every year, the number of people living with HlV and AIDS in China will grow by 100,000.
Sex HlV transmission is an acute problem with China's LGBT society.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is still high.
Because of conservative values in the country, approximately 70-90% of men who engage in sex with men end up marrying women.
Many diseases are spread by lack of knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, China's government has made universal access to HlV drugs in an effort to solve the global problem.
Maxine Waters denies the angryness of her given, the peril and the theory of co-existence by Parliament's fellows
THE U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters dropped off on Saturday's charge that her employee had posted personal information about the three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's page.
Democrat Los Angeles claimed that the claim is for members of the superior wing and their websites.
"Filence, falsehood, and many abhorrent lies," said Waters in Twitter.
The published information is reported to include home addresses and phone numbers in the United States.
Information posted by an unknown man on the Capital Hill during the hearing of the Senate commission of sexual harassment charges against a member of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh appeared on the Internet Thursday.
The strike took place shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
"Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, report that the IP address was linked to Waters' office and shared the information with Waters' staff," reports Hill.
"It's an unreasonable claim to be completely false and absolutely wrong," continued Waters.
"A member of my team, whose data, personal information and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations, has by no means been responsible for the diversion of this information.
It's an unreasonable claim to be totally false and totally false."
Waters quickly called for criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It's a rejection of anger," wrote Fleisher.
This suggests that she does not have the courage to be a member of the Congress.
If anyone is accused of what they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They shouldn't have to steer themselves outrageously.
They must not put under doubt the motives of their accusation.
They must be calm and sound.
Fleischer compared Waters' response to Judge Kavanaugh's criticism of the democrats when they were accused of being too broken during Thursday's hearing.
The Lobster Navarre, a candidate from the Republic Party, who chats and participates in meetings in intermediate elections, also said in Twitter.
"It is a responsibility, if it turns out to be true," he wrote.
In her statement Waters stated that her office had warned the relevant authorities and the law enforcement authorities about these false claims.
"We guarantee that guilt will be found," she continued, "and they will assume legal responsibility for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to any of the employees of my team."
A review of Johnny English Strikes Again strikes an imaginary spy named Rowen Atkinsan.
Now it's become traditional to look for the meaning of BRECSITH in any new British-dominated movie, and it seems to be in comedy and e-france Johnny English, which started in 2003, with Johnny English, and went on for 2011 under the title "Ading Johnny English."
Can satire well express itself in terms of how clearly stupid we look when we talk about the new export opportunities?
Anyway, the second time he appeared on the print, the incompetent Johnnie English got the opportunity to laugh at things-- his name was louder than all the comical creatures that he had made for non-English viewers in cinema.
Of course, he was a secret agent who, in spite of his triumphant claim to glamour, got a little bit like Clouseau with Mr. Bean's lynx and a little bit of a lad who brought the only note to the chorus of fire at the opening ceremony in London in 2012.
Initially his character was based on the travellers and international mysteries of Atkinson, who once played in the forgotten Barclayard, leaving chaos in his path.
There are a few nice moments here that have not happened before.
I loved Johnnie English, who is approaching the helicopter, dressed in medieval success, and his shovels banging a little on his helmet.
Dr. Atkinsan for theatrical comedy is brightly demonstrated, but the humour feels weak, and therefore strangely especially when serious films, such as "Agent 007: Mission Inexplicable", are sure to offer comedy as a major part.
Humour feels as if it's not just for adults but for children as well, and even the stupid accidents of Johnny English are not as resourceful as the silent Atkinsan movies in bin's face.
There's been a lot of serious UK problems around the world over a long time now.
Cyber-hacker infiltrated the British super-secret community of spies in the United Kingdom, revealing the names of all British agents at the scene, to the disappointment of a security agent, unfortunately, Kevin Eldson's small role.
This is the last step for the prime minister, who is a proud and mixed act who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Tesra-May, but there's nothing on the script like that.
Her intelligence consultants report that, since every real spy will be exposed, she will have to engage one of those who is already retired.
And that means that for Johnny English himself, everything gets complicated: he's now working as a sixth teacher in several school institutions, and he's teaching a lesson in being an undiscovered operator: some good examples here, because English offers the Academy of Music a lesson in espionage.
English went back to Whitehall for an extreme briefing and got together with his former longtime friend Bo, again played by Ben Miller.
At present Bo has a marriage bound to the commanding officer of the submarine, whose role Vicky Pepperdin played in vain.
So Batman and the robin are getting terribly wrong things in the Queen's secret agency, where they work again, meeting the beautiful woman with the Wet Chicken.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is receiving a dangerous command from a charismatic tech billionaire who says he can solve the problem with the UK hackers: the notorious Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow are starting their own emergency: cloak themselves under the waiter, light a French restaurant; create a pogrom, fight smugglers on board the luxury yacht Volta; English is learning a clean anarchy because it tries to use virtual reality tapes to learn about the interior of Volt's house.
All the moments are drawn for the last event, but as pleasant and noisy as the one that has a pretty lot of baby in your TV set.
Pretty good stuff.
And how about other movies about Johnny English I couldn't think of: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinsan a role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Labour Party denies that a plan is being developed to pay for the four-year working week British people with a salary of five days.
Jeremy Corbin's working party must consider a radical plan when British work only four days a week, but they're paid five days a week.
It is reported that the party wants business managers to pass on the results of the work done as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence, giving them an extra day out.
It was seen that employees were always enjoying the three-day exit, but would still receive the same salary.
The source means that the idea belongs to a party's economic program and plans to guide the country to work.
The union's convention praised the transition for a four-week period as a good way to take advantage of the change in the economy.
The oldest source of the Labour Party said for The Sunday Times: "The planned review will be announced by the end of the year.
It's not going to happen right now, but a four-hour job week is an idea that fits a party view and a common fisheries strategy to regulate economics for the benefit of workers.
The Labour Party is not the first to endorse this idea, the Green Promises Party will hold a four-hour work week in a joint election campaign in 2017.
However, the Liberian party's overall efforts are not supported.
The representative of the Labour Party said, "The four-day job of the week is not a party policy, and it's not a party that's being considered."
Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to express his view of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he had decided to regain power from duty-free directors and managers to utility companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also foresee that the current water shareholder may not get back the entire stock because the Leybarist government could make an “excurrence” based on the alleged abuses.
He also confirmed that he was planning to bring employment into the boards of companies and create joint ownership funds to transfer 10 percent of his own funds to private firms that would hold annual dividends to £500 sterling.
Lindsay Graham, John Candy told us for "60 minutes", that following the FBI, who works with Cavanaugh, should change its mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has put the final vote on his election to the Supreme Court at least a week, and the question arises as to whether the Republican Senators' bureau will be able to support it.
On Sunday's interview with "60 minutes," Scott Pally asked Republicans John Kendall and Lindsay Graham about "Sens": "Can the FBI reveal anything that can lead to change."
Kendy turned out to be more open than his colleague from the South Queen.
'I mean, of course,' said the Canada.
"I said, going to court: I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and asked him the reason for the accusation, asking, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute and unambiguous."
Graham's vote, however, seems final.
"I think Brett Cavanaugh has decided that this is going to be a scandalous indictment," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I do know this: "Brother strongly denies it," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she calls could not believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I can't see anything new."
What is the International Citizens' Festival, and what is it done to reduce poverty?
There's an International Festival on this Saturday in New York City, an annual music event that has a very impressive representation of speakers and performers and has a mission to stop world poverty.
Now, for seven years, the World Society Festival is going to be held on the great park grounds where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the concert by Janet Jackson, Kardi B and Sean Mendes, and the real purpose of the event is to stop poverty and care until 2030.
The 2012 international civil society festival is a continuation of the Global Project against taking on an international propaganda group that hopes to stop poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you don't want to pay the VIP ticket), the visitor has to have a number of tasks or "do a thing" and be a volunteer by email, write to the country leader, call any other person and raise awareness of the poverty reduction target.
But how successful was the Civil Festival for 12 years and was it able to achieve its goal?
Is it an idea to reward people with a cost-free concert as a real way of convincing people that they need active action, or is it just another case of so-called "climate" -- people feel like they're doing a good job by signing online-petition or sending tweets?
Since 2011, festival organizers have stated that they have fixed more than 19 million "actions" from their supporters who are trying to achieve different goals.
They say that these actions have helped to push influential leaders to fulfil commitments of more than 37 billion dollars that can affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group made 390 pledges and bids at least 10 billion dollars already allocated or collected.
As a result of the group's assessment, secured funds have so far exerted a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key responsibilities include providing food, partnerships with investors and performers based in the United Kingdom, “helping children develop in full volume”, a promise to provide Rwanda with 35 million dollars to help avoid poverty in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets from citizens.
"In support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can address the social injustice of undernourishment in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman said in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5,000 shares had been carried out, which were called on in the United Kingdom to improve food intake for both mothers and children, the government had announced the funding of a project called for food aid, which reached 5 million women and children with food problems.
In answer to one of the frequent questions on the website "what makes you think we can end poverty?"
The global festival replied: "It will be a long and hard way; sometimes we'll suffer for sores and failures."
But just like great civil rights and anti-abortion movements, we're going to succeed, because together we're stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Janel Monae are one of the series of Persons that are taking part in this year's New York City event, to be run by Debra-Lee Fernness and Hugh Jackman.
USA can use the Navy for “blocking” to prevent the export of Russian oil and gas
"Weastington may need to contact the Navy to prevent a Russian energy outpost in the EZ and Middle East markets," said US secretary Ryan Zink, reported Washington Examiner.
The origin of the claims that Russia's actions in Syria, particularly where it operates on the invitation of the legitimate government, are grounds for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to buy energy just as much as they do in Eastern Europe and South Europe," he said.
And, according to the public, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States is able to make sure, through the Navy, the openness of the seamen and, when necessary, to organise a blockade so that their energy probably doesn't go to market," he said.
Zinke addressed the party's participants, organised by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-commercial group that positions itself as the "vote of energy consumers" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
"The economic alternation over Iran and Russia is more or less balanced and replaces fuel," he said, calling Russia a "district country" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements came at a time when Trump's administration wanted to significantly increase the export of its scarce natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which for European consumers is a much cheaper option.
For this, Trump's administrators, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to step out of the "right" pipeline project "North Stream 2", which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a "pull" Moscow.
The mass has repeatedly underlined that the North Stream 2 pipeline, at $11 billion, which is created to raise the power of an existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a uniquely economic project.
Kramer claims that Washington's harsh opposition to this project is taking on economics and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we have the only view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to select suppliers," Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Peri in September in Moscow.
Americans got a blow in response to Germany, which reaffirmed the project's ownership again.
A major German organisation representing industry, the Federation of German Manufacturers (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our supply of energy," said Dieter Kemp, head of the Federation of German Manufacturers (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to have a very serious discussion of her participation in the 2020 presidential election, by the Senator from Massachusetts.
The Senator of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, stated on Saturday that it would be a serious matter to consider his part in the election of the President after the interim elections.
During her speech in Hallioki, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of her parting.
"It is time for women to head to Washington and order our inactive government, and I also speak of women in the highest positions," she said, in line with The Hill.
"After the 6th of November, I shall seriously consider the possibility of talking to the President."
During a talk at Warren, she went to President Donald Trump and said that he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am extremely concerned about what Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticised Trump and his candidate at the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote in her tweet, "Absolutely, before the vote, that the FBI should investigate."
However, polls published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters do not think it should be the president-elect in 2020.
According to the polling centre of Safalka/Bostan Globe, five hundred and fifty percent of the "mighty" voters of Massachusetts said that the senator should not be fluttered.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The survey showed more support by former Governor David Patrick, where 38 percent were over and 48 percent against.
Other well-known names among the Democrats that were discussed in connection with the 2020 patent ballot include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press Biden stated that he would officially decide by January.
At the exit in support of Donald Trump Sarah Palin, she mentioned the post-traumatic syndrome of Trek Pauline.
The 26-year-old Thrac Pauline spent a year in Iraq following an invitation to serve in September.
On Monday evening he was arrested and he was charged with domestic violence
"What my son is going through after his return, I can compare with the results of the post-practice syndrome and the injuries with which our soldiers return, in the other families," she said as she gathered at the convention in support of Donald Trump in Talls, Akloham.
Pauline called the arrest "a good question", and stated that her son, along with other veterans of the war, "returned a little by others, hardened, returned with the question of whether there is any respect for which soldiers, pilots, other military, gave themselves to the country" -- a matter of honour.
He was arrested Monday in Wasila, Alaska, and he was charged with domestic violence against a woman, an obstacle to trying to report domestic violence, intoxicating weapons, according to Dan Bennett, the police secretary at the Vasilla Police Department.
18 state and district of Colombia support countering new policy by providing shelter
Eighteen states and Columbia County support countering a new U.S. policy that denies shelter to victims of gangs or domestic violence.
18 state and district promoters in Colombia dropped an analytical note Friday in Washington, D.C., to support shelter policy objections, reports the NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace's case against Sessins, which was opened in August by the American Union of Civil Rights against Federal Politics, was not revealed.
She claimed that her partner "and his friends with the hard gang" raped her, but the US authorities on July 20 refused to board.
She was detained in Texas.
State-supported users Grace described Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as the largest number of requests for shelter in the United States, such as countries with serious gangs and domestic violence.
The New American Maritime Policy changed its 2014 decision by the Immigration Commission, which allowed non-documented immigrants who were victims of domestic violence to seek refuge.
District Attorney General Carl Reissin stated on Friday that the new policy "ignorates the ten years of the state, country and world challenge".
"Federal law requires that claims in port be based on facts and circumstances of the case, and such a change violates this principle," the analyst notes.
The lawyers also said in a note that denying immigrants makes the economy worse by the United States, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and "create the necessary jobs".
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessins ordered in June that immigration judges no longer allow shelter for domestic violence and gang violence.
"The consumer is given to leave his country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or political views," said Seschens, on June 11, declaring it.
The wharf never meant solving problems, even all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
The desperate rescue work for Paul. In the process of trying to find the survivors, the number of fatalities has doubled
The survivors are in a very difficult situation.
"It's all very tense," said 35-year-old Richard Kusum, calming his little son with the temperature at the evacuation center of Paul's devastated city.
"Every minute a car comes in fast.
Clean water is very small."
The lodgers began returning to their depraved houses, figuring out the wet things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were wounded and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-point earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Harris, who broke the spine and shoulder, are outside Paul's army hospital, where patients are treated in the street because of the strong pushes that are repeated.
He had tears in his eyes when he remembered the feeling of strong underground jolts in the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I was stifled under the ruins of the walls," said Harris Associated Press, and added that his family had come to town for marriage.
"I heard her call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador Blames China on "Threats" with the use of a "propaganda commercial"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper printed a four-page advertisement in an American daily, praising the mutual benefits of American-Chinese trade, the American ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump mentioned China Daily's salary addition to Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere with the election of American Cangress on November 6.
Trump's indictment that China was trying to intervene in the American election meant what American officials called a new phase in the Reuters conversation with Washington's company under pressure from China.
Although advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice for promoting trade, now Beijing and Washington has unleashed a trade war, which has resulted in the mutual imposition of tariffs on imports.
The repressive fares, stated by American and Chinese experts, were introduced to harm such an experimenter as entrepreneurs from the state of Iowa who support the Republic's Trump party.
Terry Bransted, U.S. Ambassador to China, and former Governor of Iowa, the leading exporter of agricultural goods in China, said that Beijing had harmed an American worker, farmer, and businessman.
China, by Branstad wrote in an author's article by Des Moines Register Sunday, “now doubles its efforts by printing a propaganda advertisement in our free press.”
"The distribution of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a good American tradition of freedom of speech and free press by printing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," wrote Bransted.
"And when you look at the Beijing newsstands, there you will find not so many voices against it, and you will not see the real reflection of other assumptions that can be made by Chinese against the dangerous trajectory of the economy, taking into account the fact that the press is under the Iron Fifth Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers has dropped the proposal" to print his article, though he did not name it.
Republicans are repelling female voters just before the intermediate elections from the Cawano fiasco, warn analysts
While many prominent Republicans are defending a candidate for Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh's post before the face of several sexual assault charges, analysts have warned that they will get a blow in response, especially from women, during the upcoming immediate elections.
The emotions around this were very strong, and most Republicans are already showing they are ready to vote.
"These things can no longer be returned," said Grant Richard, professor of political science at Maxwell Syracuse University of Edition "The Hill" for an article published on Saturday.
Richard said that he was not sure that Senator Jeff Flake's (Arizon) statements about the FBI's investigation would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women aren't going to forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it tomorrow and November," said Carin Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national press secretary of the MoveOn Group of the Washington County district newspaper.
On Friday morning, protestors debated "The November Quick!" during a demonstration in the Senate Hall, when Republicans controlling the legal committee decided to move Kavanaugh's candidate, in spite of a statement by Christian doctor Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be extremely great," said Stu Rotenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they're already tall, and it's true.
But they may be even higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and young voters from 18 to 29 years old, who don't even like the President, but don't often vote."
Even before the open request by Ford, in which she detailed her indictment of a candidate to the Supreme Court for sexual assault, analysts suggest that, if Republicans insist on confirmation, there may be a strong blow in response.
"For a Republican party it has made a mess," said Michael Steel, former head of the National Committee of the Republican Party at the beginning of last week, according to the NBC News.
"It is not about the vote of the committee or about the final vote, or about whether Cavanaugh will be in office. It is about how the Republicans have done it and how they have done it," remarked Guy Cecile, director of the Priorities of the United States, a group that is helping to elect Democrats.
However, it seems as if Americans have split up in matters of Ford or Cavanaugh's rights, but a little more speaks than the last.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the students are probably or may not trust Ford's statement, and 35 percent say they probably don't trust Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh might have lied in his statement, and 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After a push by Flake the FBI is investigating the charges on the Ford side and, at least, another person, Deborah Ramiprez, reports the Guardian.
Last week, Ford made a statement under oath to the Senate Legal Bureau that Kavanaugh, when he was drunk, was trying to reach her at 17 years of age.
Ramiroz claims that a candidate to the Supreme Court demonstrated her genitalia at the evening when they were studying at Yale in 1980.
A world network discoverer plans to start a new internet to build a Google and Facebook competition
Tom Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world network, starts a startup to be done by Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company built on the open Berners-Lea Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose the location to store the data and who is allowed to access this information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he complained that by creating Inrupt, he was referring to the "government over the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up.
"That's a Historic moment."
This program uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own data storage on the Internet, or PD.
Synchronising folder
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all at once on one browser at a time.
The uniqueness of the personal repository of data on the Internet is that only the user can identify who has access to what kind of information they are.
The company calls it "the personal strengthening of the potential using data."
For John Bruce's executive director, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the ability to share resources, process and skills in order to make Solid available to everyone.
The campaign now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM has bought, a number of developers working on a project called contract and resource encoders.
Since this week, technology developers around the world have been able to create their own decentralized programs using Inrupt web-based tools.
Brners-Lee stated that he and his team had not talked to Facebook and Google about introducing or not making complete changes when all their business models are immediately reviewed.
"We do not ask their permission."
On Saturday's publication on the issue of Medium Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission "is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems for protecting integrity and the quality of the new network created on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet into a World Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been very influential in favour of net neutrality.
Even if you start Inrupt, Berners-Lei will become the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the new era of the web," Berners-Lea added.
Bernard Van: Remarry of a clergyman awarded by the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England, rewarded with the Cross of Victoria during World War I as a member of the fighting, was nominated in his town after 100 years.
Commander-in-Chief Bernard Van was awarded 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack under Belengliz and Leukur.
However, after four days he died by a sniper bullet and never found out what got the highest military British reward.
On Saturday in the town of Rashden, the county of Nartgemptanshire two of his grandsons in order opened a memorial stone.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that it was "very symbolic", that the stone opened 100 years after his grandfather was awarded.
According to London Gazette, September 29, 1918, Lt Van led his battalion through the channel De San Quentin "through a thick mist and under a strong rose- and bullet-fire of an employee."
Then he ran on the line of fire and "with great boldness" led the soldier forward, seizing the cannon and beating three squadrons.
Commander Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little more than a month's war was over.
72-year-old Michael Van said that his grandfather's actions were "something I would never have been able to do and something worthy of respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also raised a wreath after the parade that headed the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Van said, "To him it is a great honour to take part in the cause," and added that "the manhood of the true hero has been demonstrated by the support that many have shown."
The MMA fans waited all night to see Bellator 206, they instead got the lead of Peppa
Imagine you stood there all night to watch Bellator 206, and then you're denied a view of the main event.
There were 13 fights in the program from San Jose, including six on the main map, and they were shown on direct air all night on the British Channel 5.
And on the sixth morning, Gerar Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the reunion, watching the UK go nuts when the program changed into Pepe's lead.
Some were disappointed after spending the sleepless night waiting especially for this fight.
One of the players on Twitter called the switch to a child's cartoon a "someone's stupid joke."
In response to a question about Dave Schwarz, senior Vice President Bellator on marketing and communication issues, he said, "It's a good state order and six o'clock this morning's content was inappropriate and we had to switch to a children's program."
"Yes, Pig Pepa."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said that they would be working on a program to take into account British viewers in the future.
"As a matter of fact, we are considering the possibility of repeating it, in my opinion, we can resolve it," said Koker.
"But now it's six o'clock in the week, and we can't solve it by Sunday at this time, and this is Monday at their time.
But we're doing our best.
Believe this: We got a lot of messages and they weren't all friendly.
We've tried to solve the question because it's a technical error.
But it turned out to be a state decision.
But the thing is, the next time you do something like this, it just doesn't happen.
We reduce the number of contractions from six to five, as we usually do, and this together we wanted to advise the fans, but we got older.
It's an awful situation."
Disks of the Free Island: Tom Daley felt "significant" because of sexuality
The Olympic dive down the water dives in Tom Daily said that it grew with a sense of insignificance for others because of its sexuality- -but it gave him motivation on the way to success.
A 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize that "not all are like me" until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's Leading Lauren Laverne, he said he supported the rights of gays to continue with the other "hope".
He also stated that, when he had a child he began to think less about winning the almpics.
The traditional one that led this pretty old Kirsty Young software has taken a few months to rest because of the disease.
In the role of a man who turned out to be on a deserted island, at the first program of Laverne, Daley said that as a child, he felt "smaller" than anyone else because "the society didn't take who the boys liked and the girls liked."
He said, "I think now that feeling that you're not like everyone else and that it's given me strength and inspiration for success."
He wanted to prove that he was a "someone," said he did not disappoint those who had learned about his sexuality.
The two-fold bronze prose of the alampiads had become a major activist of the LGBT movement and at the Commonwealth Game in Australia this year urged the countries not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he believed it because he was fortunate to be alive openly, without persecution, and wanted to give the hope to others.
A three-pronged champion of the world said that when he fell in love with a man -- an American scriptist, director and producer of Destiny Lance Blacke, whom he met in 2013 -- "it was unexpected for me."
Daley married an Oscar-holder who was 20 years older than he did last year, but he said that the age difference didn't matter.
"When you walk through such a young age" -- at the first alampidades -- he was 14 years old and still three years later his father died of cancer -- he said that it was hard to find a swinger who had survived such takeoffs and falls.
In June they became parents, their son's name is Robert Ray Blackdale, and Daley said that his "complete perspectives" have changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I have to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know, the world has things that are more important than the gold medal of the Olympics.
Robi is my golden Olympic medal."
His son's name is Robert, the same as his father, and his father died in 2011, at the age of 40, from brain cancer.
Daley said that the father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked if they bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics--he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally understand that he was not immortal," he said.
The next year, Daley won the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life--to jump into the water in front of my dancers at the Olympics, it's the best feeling," he said.
This also affected the selection of the song, the Proud by Heather Small, which found a feedback in it for the preparation of the almpics and from which the ants are running.
The Disks of the Free Island can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 p.m. on the British Summer Hour.
Michelson, who no shape left on the bench in Ryder's cup on Saturday,
American Phil Michelson set up a record Sunday, playing his 47th match at the Ryder Cup, but he needs to get his uniform back so that this event doesn't turn out to be an accident.
Michelsano, who will play this biannual, record 12th time competition, team captain Jim Fürich planted spares for Saturdays.
Instead of being in the middle of events, and he was there often on the United States team, the five-time winner of the teacup shared its days between a cheerleader and a training team, falling back into shape.
Even at the peak of his career, he was not the best player, and now the 48-year-old golfer is not the perfect choice for an uneasy Le Golf National field, where beatings are severely misbehaved.
And if the field itself is not dismal enough, Michelangelo, in his ninth match on Sunday, will fight against the exact British Open Franciscan robin champion, who, along with Tommy Fleetwood, won all four matches this week.
When Americans who stand at four points at the beginning of 12 single matches start off with success, the Michelangelo match can be extremely important.
The Führer expressed confidence in this player, but there was nothing more he could say.
"He fully understood his role today, clapped my back, and said it would be ready tomorrow," said Fürich.
"He is very sure of himself.
He was taken to the Hall of Fame and gave a very large team last and this week.
Perhaps I didn't plan it for two games.
I had planned more, but it worked just as we thought we would play.
It wants to be in the field as well as all others."
Michelangelo will beat Nick Fall's record by the number of matches in a bowl of Ryder, played on Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in a Ryder cup, which has never been the same as achievements in individual games.
In Michelangelo 18 wins, 20 loses and seven loses, although Führer said his presence was of use to the team.
"He's a funny, sarcastic, humorous, fond of making fun of people and just a very kind man who's good at teaming," he explained.
"I believe that more young players were pleased to deny his jokes, as well as at this week, and it was good to see.
He gives the command a lot more than just a game."
Captain of the European team, Thomas Børn, knows that the great intrusion can quickly disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, a captain of the European team, knows from experience that a considerable stretch before the individual games of the last day on the Raider cup may easily disappear.
The Danish player debuted in 1997 at Walderham, where the European team, led by Suve Ballesteras, preferred five points over Americans, but finished at a minimum of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that in Walderham we had a great advantage and won, but unfortunately we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost," said Børn after watching the class of 2018 team win 5-3 and on Friday, and yesterday, and took a 10-6 to Le Golf National.
"The story shows me and everyone else on the team that it isn't the end of the story.
We have to play all over the place tomorrow.
Go into the field and do everything right.
Before you get to the table, nothing is complete.
We have a goal and this is an attempt to win this trophy, which is exactly what we're focused on.
I keep saying this, I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that there are better players on the other side of the world."
Satisfied by the way his players played a heavy golf field, Bjorn added, "I will never overestimate myself in this.
Tomorrow will be a completely different game.
You'll see individual games tomorrow, and that's quite different.
Just great, if you're in a field with a partner and everything goes well, but if you play one, then here are checked out your true golfer's talents.
That's what the players have to bring to it, that they have to show us the best tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, the pits have to go, and you have to show everything best as an individual player."
Unlike Bjorn, his rival Jim Führer hopes for the best individual game of his sportsmen than the one they have demonstrated in partnership, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Führer himself was on both sides of these matches the last day, playing on a winning team in Brooklyn, and losing when Europe had the Medina Miracle.
"I remember every word of it," he said, answering the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, adjusted his players the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but always want to have the quick start you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
If the speed grows, then the biggest pressure comes from those who play the match in the middle.
We've put together a proper schedule and placed the players as we like, you know, tomorrow we're trying to get some magic."
Thomas got the job of starting to play games and speaking against Rory McKellroy in the main game, and Paul Casey, Justin Roose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, and Jan Paulter are going to play against the top golfers.
"I've put my players in such order, because I believe I will close everything," said Bjorn about his choices for individual matches.
Launch a new German warship re-delayed
The new FMF of Germany had to go into line in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War times, but it would not appear until next year because of the unequal systems and constantly increasing costs, according to local media.
The Rheinland-Pfalz launch, an absolute new class of frigates by Baden-Wuerttemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, quoted by a military representative.
The ship had to go into shape in 2014, but the problems that came after the building interfered with this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg military ships ordered back in 2007 must replace the old Bremen class frigates.
They're going to be armed with strong cannons, different anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some steels technologies, such as reduced radar visibility, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important features, which are longer periods between maintenance, new frigates may not be joined by their parties for up to two years.
However, the constant deferrals mean that modern warships -- which can allow Germany to demonstrate its power beyond the country -- are getting old by the time they finally get in line, by Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 arrived at the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned its ship to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for return, but the German media has written about many of the "defects in software and equipment" that make a ship useless in a war mission.
Software failures were particularly important because Baden-Wuerttemberg had only 120 crews of the old Bremen class.
It also turned out that the ship has a very large weight that reduces its productivity and limits the possibility of further updates.
The Rheinland-Pfalz accounted for 7,000 tons, which is twice as high as the weight of a class like that used by Germany in World War II.
Besides the missing installation of the entire project, including the teaching of the crew, is also a problem.
Tzana has reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), although it initially amounted to 2.2 billion euros.
Problems that accumulate with the new frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that German marine powers are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, stated that the IMF "has fewer warships and fewer warships".
He stated that the problem with time is increasing, as old ships are listed, and ships are not replaced.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the IMF.
National Associations for Awe of Monuments overheard the secret life of bats
A new study in the Scottish Mountains aims to discover how bats use the landscape to hunt food.
The students hope to find something new in the behavior of the unique flying milk-fed and help in future actions to keep these animals alive.
Research by researchers at the National Society of Protection of Scotland's Monuments deals with small bats and also by the stormy long bats of Dabanton in Gardens in Western-Ross.
The special recording devices will be placed at the top of this area in order to keep track of the active speakers during the season.
Society and volunteer workers will carry out mobile research using manual detectives.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all the records determines the frequency of calls the bats as well as the talkers who do.
This pattern will be used to create a detailed picture of the animal behaviour in this landscape.
Rob Dewar, advisor to the National Society for the Conservation of Nature, hopes the results will show what areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information helps determine the advantages of creating places of residence such as meadows, and how to sustain forests to inhabit bats and other animal-related products.
The number of speakers in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased considerably in the last century.
They're threatened by construction and developmental work that affects the environment and destroys them.
Wind turbines and lighting can be as risky as sticky flies and some chemicals for building materials, and they're threatened by home cats.
People aren't blind at all.
However, because of their nightlife the ears were spoken more receptive than the eyes when the talk was about hunting.
They use complex echolocation techniques to detect bugs and obstacles in the flight path.
National societies that are responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, are very serious about the talkers.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, check places of residence, and sometimes rescue activities.
The organization has even created the first and only Scotsman bats in the Trieste in Damfrais and Galaway, where there are eight out of ten Scotton bats in Scotland.
Major David Thompson says it's the perfect land for bats.
"Tut, the Trill, we have just the perfect place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees, and a very good place to live.
But we don't know much about tellers yet, so our work here and in other pennies will help us to understand more that they need a better life."
He stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out repairs to property, as one can unintentionally destroy one saddle by killing up to 400 males and young bats, which will lead to the total destruction of the local population.
Individuals are under protection and are forbidden to kill, frighten, disturb or destroy their saddles.
Elizabeth Farrell, an organizational employee in Scotland, has called on the community to assist in this matter.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don't even know how many of our species live. "
In the early days of the rape charge, his lawyers are going to sue the German log
Stephen Randall called the prosecution of "fake news" and said that people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German journal Der Spiegel, which published these charges.
Forward of the Portugal and Juventus was the indictment for the rape of Catherine Majorg's American in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Then, as if he paid her $375 000 for his silence, he wrote to Der Spiegel on Friday.
In the video Instagram Live 33-year-old Randall addressed 142 million of his subscribers hours after the release of the indictments, calling this message a "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's messages are fairy-tale news," said the five-time gold-ball owner in front of the camera.
"They want to do a advertisement in my name.
It's okay.
They want to make themselves known by mentioning my name, but it's part of my work.
I am a happy and kind man," he added with a smile.
Users of Randall are preparing a case in court against Der Spiegel's magazine on charges that call it "an inmissible report on suspicion in a private matter," Reuters reported.
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would require compensation for "moral damage to the sum that matches the difficulty of rights abuses, and in recent years this may be the most serious violation of personal rights."
There was an incident in June 2009 at the Palms Howttell and Cassin Hotel in Las Vegas.
Meeting at the night club of Randall and Majorg, if we would go back to the football player's room, where he would have raped her annally, as written in the documents of the Clark County District District Court in Nevada.
The major said that he subsequently withdrew and said that, for a "99 percent", he is a "good guy" who suffers from "one percent".
The papers said that Ranaldu admitted they had sex, but on their side.
Myrgo also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the damage to the hospital, but then agreed to a court order because she was "very afraid of revenge" and was concerned that she would be "publicly brought up".
A 34-year-old woman says she wants to resume her indictment because she feels a moral trauma to the occasion.
In a time when he had his place, Randall was going to move to Madrid's Real from Manchester United, and in the summer he moved to the Italian Juventus, closing the deal into 100 million euros.
BROXIT: Britain "Always harms" car developers loses
Great Britain will “always lose its status as a world leader in car construction after Brexit,” said Minister of Business Greg Clark.
He added that his "disturbing" statement by Toyota UK for the BBC that, if Britain leaves the EU unopposed, the company will temporarily cut production in a plant in Bernaston, near Derby in half.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
A Japanese car manufacturer said that a delay on the border as a result of Brexit's unagreed could lead to a reduction in jobs.
In the past year, a plant in Bernston, where Toyota Auris and Avensis are made, produced almost 150,000 cars, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"I think that when Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, the production in our industry will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota, Bernston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom raised the question of how cross-border trade would be done when Britain came out of the EU without agreement, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, says that it's going to close its Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that car builders talk about the risk of chain supplies as a result of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is based on "exactly in a period of time" when spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU unopposed on March 29th, there may be clashes on the border that lead to delays and shortages of particles.
Toyota can't be kept on a bus in Derby for more than a day, so the company says so production stops.
Mr. Clarke stated that the "Plan Chekers" Tereza May about future relations with the EU "are done precisely in order to avoid these border checks."
"We need an understanding. We want the best agreement that will not only allow us to succeed today but also allow us to take this opportunity," he said in Today's BBC Radio 4.
"The information that we get not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers suggests that we should be able to continue working on successful supply chains."
Toyota Company has not been able to report how long it will not work, but has warned the future that it has added a cost to reduce the competitiveness of the factory and to reduce jobs.
Peter Tsovaris, who works in Bernaston for 24 years and who is the union's head chief, said that the union members are very concerned: "Then, when I get the job cut, they won't recover.
The press secretary of the government stated: "We have proposed a precise plan of our future relations with the EU, which deserves confidence."
The White House declares that meeting Trump with Rosenstein may be postponed again
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for a week", while the fight around the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh said Sunday a representative of the White House.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of special advisor Robert Mueller, who is learning to interfere with Russia's choices, Trump's liaisons with Russia, and the potential obstruction of justice by the President.
Take out Trump, the Attorney General's assistant, or not, and thus put under threat Mueller's independence, months of oil burning in the fire of Washington gossip.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record a conversation with Trump, and that the president would be able to withdraw from his seat with 25 packages.
Rosenstein denied it.
But last Monday he went to the White House among the rumors that he was going to retire.
Instead it was announced that there would be a meeting with Trump on Thursday, who was at the AC headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said that he "would not want to" to call off Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashes at hearing at the Senate Legal Committee, where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate for a week against Kavanaugh, which further slowed down the Senate vote.
"Sarah Sanders' Presbytery" appeared on a Sunday program called Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date may be on this week perhaps the following. I believe that it is rather a week later that all the other things that have room in the Supreme Court case are taken into account.
But everything will happen, and I always give the press the latest information."
Some journalists are willing to dispute her claim: Sanders has not performed a briefing for press in the White House since September 10th.
Chris Wallace's leading program asked her why.
Sanders said that the rarity of bridging has been called not to contempt for "public workers," though she added, "I will agree with the fact that they are working for the public."
Then she said that the direct contact of Trump and the press would increase.
"The President conducts more meetings with answers to the press than any president who has ever been to him," she said, adding without any particular fact: "We have studied these figures."
The briefings take place, Sanders reported, but "if the press has a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than to do it through me.
We've been trying to do this a lot, you've seen us do this for the last few weeks, and this kind of meeting where you can ask the president a question, to replace the briefing."
Tramp regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or taking part in meetings in the street, or at press conferences with high foreign gasses.
The President's press conference is rare.
This week in New York the President demonstrated why, when free and sometimes extravagantly appeared before the reporters.
Minister for Health has written to workers from EU countries in Scotland's health care system before Brexit
The minister of health wrote to EU health workers working in Scotland to express his gratitude for the country's name and to make sure that they stayed after Brexit.
John Freeman sent a letter less than half an hour before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of living claims from EU citizens working in state services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "The talks between the UK and the EU continued on the way out of our country in the summer. They lead to the expected decisions this fall.
But the British government also made an effort to prepare for the script without agreement.
I know that it is a very disturbing time for you all.
So I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
My colleagues from all EU countries and not only provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care services, they also benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us."
Christian Abercrombie carried an emergency operation after his head injury
Linebacker's team, Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, has carried out an emergency operation after receiving head trauma in a Sunday match that his team lost to 31-27 Command Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Tennessee State Reed's main coach told the reporter that the trauma player got just before the break.
"He's moved on a sideline and suddenly fell," said Reed.
The coaches and the medics had left the Abercombi oxygen still in the field before putting it on to the violence and transport it to the diagnosis.
Teacher Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was no "substantiality about what it was" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the player got trauma.
Abercombi, a fellow sportsman, spends the first season in Tennessee State after switching from Illinois.
But before he left the game on Saturday, he made five complete jumps, which only gave 18 captures over the season.
British foreign purchases will pay a greater price for the real estate
Pursuant to a new conservation plan, foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher fee and additional money will go to help the homeless
This action neutralizes the success of Korbin's initiative by attracting young voters
An increase in government duties will result in those who do not pay their taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance plans to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Today, Teresa May's announcement is that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher government fee, and extra money will go to help the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's initiative in attracting young voters, and it is still an accessible dwelling. It is directed towards people with high incomes.
An increase in government contributions is made to people and companies that do not pay their taxes in the UK, and the money they receive will go to a government housing programme for the homeless.
An increase in the present state duty, including a higher level, taken two years ago, on the purchase of other houses and dwellings for hire, could amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
Well, 13 percent of the new jobs in London are being bought by non-presidents of the United Kingdom, which leads to higher prices and makes it hard for new customers to buy their first dwellings.
Many of the rich regions of the country -- especially the capital -- have become ghost towns, because most of the consumers from abroad do not live in the United Kingdom for most of their time.
The new policy appeared literally a few weeks after Barris Johnson called on him to reduce the government's capacity for young buyers to facilitate the acquisition of the first dwelling.
He accused large construction firms of keeping high prices on the property by taking up the land and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to cancel the quotas for available housing to fix the "disgusting situation with housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a loud series of living reforms, including controlling the rent and stopping the "indescribable" eviction.
He also wants to give local councils more powers in the area of housing.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I stated that I would dedicate my work to the Prime Minister's establishment of the re-establishment of the British dream -- life for every new generation should be made better.
This means improving our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work here, and build their lives.
However, it's unfair that people who don't live in the UK and foreign companies can buy real estate just as easily as British workers can.
For too many people a dream to have their own house is becoming more and more unattainable, and the problem of the homeless remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to manage a Scottish conglomerate"
Sanderland coach Jack Ross said that his main ambition was to ever be a coach of the Scotland rally.
A 42-year-old Scotlander performs the task of restoring a club from the north-east, which is now in the third place of the First League, in three points from the first.
He moved on to this work in the summer after returning the St. Mary's to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to speak for my country as a player.
"But it didn't work," said Ross in his transmission to the BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"I grew up sick behind Scotland at Hampton Stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
But this is where I'm going to be a successful club coach."
Among Ross' predecessors in the Sanderland coach's crew, Dick Advact, David Moose, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poye, and Paula de Kanya.
Former coach Aloa Atletik says he felt no fear of such famous names in such a large club, prior to rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now will the success for me be the answer to the question "will I be able to return this club to the Prime Minister's League?"
According to the structure and material base of the club his place is probably in Primer League," he said.
"Not just return it there, but I shall count my work successful only if I can get the club back there."
He's only been a coach for three years now, and he's been an assistant coach at Damboton for 15 months at Harts Training.
Then he helped Aloy come back from the third league and turned Saint-Mirren from a loser who almost made it to the Championships in the victory of the next season.
Ross says it's more comfortable now than it is during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Filkinka, Saint-Miren and Hamilton Academy.
recalling a job at Aloa, he said, "It was a really important choice."
"I really believed that training was what I needed, even more than the game.
Sounds amazing, because I worked well, earned well, and reached certain heights.
But the game may be hard.
There are a lot of things that need to be done every week.
I'm going through it now, when you talk about stress and pressure, but training is what you need.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, and it's the best time for me to grow up."

A perfect time to have a pint of beer – 17:30 on Saturday
The hot summer has raised the arrival of British populations struggling to survive, but has brought pressure on the network of restaurants.
According to statistics from the pop and bar group, sales rose by 2.7 percent in glue, but in restaurants sales decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of CGA's consulting business group, who was collecting this statistic, said: "It's been solar weather and longer than expected, participated in the World Cup finals, which means that in July what happened in June, when the sales increased by 2.8 percent, and here the old ones suffered even more.
The decrease in sales in restaurants by 1.8 percent in June is just down in the glue.
Shops and bars that mainly sell drinks until they have shown the best results in contrast to restaurants.
The pubs, which sell more food, too, got drunk in the sun, though not as much as the renegotiated.
It looks like people just wanted to drink.
In the pubs and bars, the sales of drinks grew by 6.6 percent, and the sale of food fell by three percent."
Paul Numan, an RSM analyst on rest and placement issues, said, "This is a trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to the volume of sales in the public food market, when it comes to the impact and impact of important social and sporting events, it remains the most important factors.
No wonder restaurants continue to compete because sales have dropped by 4.8 percent per year, and it's very unpleasant when prices are constantly rising.
The long and hot summer came at a bad time for operators who concentrated on food, and time to show, whether a lower temperature in August would bring such a expected relief."
A total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including recently opened jars in glue 2.7 percent, reflecting the slowdown in the brand development.

Every fifth child has a secret account in social media that it hides from parents
The study showed that every fifth child, some of whom had only 11 complete, has secret accounts in social media that they hide from parents and teachers.
20,000 high school students showed an increase in Facebook Instagram pages
This news is fueled by fears that the sex content is published there
Twenty percent students said they had a parent account that shows them to their parents
Every fifth child, some of whom only 11 filled in, creates counting accounts in social media that he keeps secret from his parents.
The study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the rapid growth of Facebook Instagram accounts, which are presented on the Instagram web site.
This news is fueled by fears that sexual content is being published there.
Twenty percent of students said that they keep "clean" account to show to their parents, and they also keep private account.
One mother, who had accidentally found the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, found out that she had called on others to "rape me".
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC found that 40 percent of teenagers aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It's very worrying that so many teenagers want to create places on the Internet where they can't be found by their parents or teachers."
Aylide Doyle is going to be the "voice of sportsmen" in the Scottish Council of Light Athletics
Eileed Doyle was selected to the Scotland Council of Light Athletics as an observing member of the Council at the annual general meeting of that body.
Doyle, Scotland's most titled lightweight, and Ian Beatie's chairman, described this event as a great opportunity for those who run sports to get a lot of benefits from their experience at a wide range of levels, including international in the past decade.
"Eilide has great respect for Scotland, Great Britain and the World Partnerships, and we are sure that lightweight athletes in Scotland will get a lot of good advice from her," said Beatie.
Doyle said, "I want to act as a sportsman voice, and I hope I can help run sports in Scotland."
A USman who won 200 and 400 metres of gold in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and two more gold medals in other alms, and who is now an expert on the BBC, can't go after a consulter survived.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago I suffered a blow.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it's only time to show whether I'm going to make amends to some degree.
It was hard work, but I'm completely recovered, again learning how to walk and now practice through life!
Thank you for your support!'
By advertising a milk pump, where the mother is compared to the cows, shared her views on the Internet
The company's production of smallpox shared the opinion by issuing an ad, which is equal to the feeding women with the cows that are breast-feeding.
To mark the launch of what is called the world's first hoped-for little pump, the consumer company Elvie released an Iranian music commercial based on video to show the freedom that that feeds the mother.
Four real mothers dance in a shit with cows under a song, where they say, "Yes, I give myself, but I don't have a tail," and, "In case you haven't noticed, it's not a wash, it's my breast."
And he said, "Give, give, I feed children, give, I give to my women."
However, the advertisement that was posted on the Facebook page caused a hot debate on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments -- the video response was ambiguous, many people said it was a horror of small production.
"It is a bad decision to use cows for advertising this produce.
As we are, they must load up and command to give milk, here are their only children picked up in a few days," one viewer wrote.
Elvie's little pump insidiously hiding in the bra for feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was, "I understand the traumaticness of both the mother and the child.
But why not use them for advertisements of small pumps for mothers that do not require children?"
Someone added, "This is an unthinkable advertisement."
Others were defending the advertisement, and one woman said that she thought it was a fun song.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd like to have one of those if I were breast-feeding.
Insecting milk makes me feel cowly.
This advertisement was a little crazy, but I liked it.
It's a genius product," she wrote.
Another comment was, "Very funny ads directed to mothers who suck up milk pump (often on their desktop or in the toilet) and hear themselves "cow".
This advertisement neither endorses nor condemns petty industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they were all dancing with invisible tiny pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of a advertising company is based on the fact that many women who use small pumps feel like cows.
However, the pump of Elvie Pump is completely soundless, has no justice, no pipe, and insensibly hides in the bra for feeding women, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to keep children and even leaves the house while working on the device.
Ana Ballarin, partner and creative director of Mother’s company, observed: “Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves to be run out of time and practice.
As we took the parallel between feeding women and small cows, we wanted to pay attention to the dissipation of milk and its difficulties, while at the same time demonstrating a funny and healthy way in which a new small pump would bring about the extraordinary freedom of movement.
Not the first time Elvie's little pump got the centre of attention.
During the London week, a fashionable mother of two children appeared on the floor in her clothes from Martha Yakobowski using this product.
Hundreds of child migrants without undue noise are transferred to a refugee camp on the Texas border
Although the number of border crossings a month has almost remained unchanged, the number of children migrant detainees has increased sharply, partly as a result of this being a hard-core rhetoric and politics conducted by the Trump administration, which have hampered the placement of children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are illegal immigrants who are careful to place themselves at risk, taking responsibility for the child.
Risks grew markedly in June when federal authorities announced that a potential sponsor and other adult household members would need to fall to their fingertips and that data would be passed on to the immigration authority.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a high-ranking immigration and customs official, presented a report to Kangres on the arrest of ten people who had been requested to sponsor minors without escort.
Later in the agency, 70 percent of the people who were arrested had no priors.
"About 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of their households are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are foreign to the criminal past.
"That's why we keep pursuing such people," said Mr. Olbens.
For faster processing of children, officials have introduced new rules which require some to appear in court within a month of the date of the delay, since, according to the employees of the shelter, it has previously been 60 days' standard term.
A large number of people will have to use video liaison instead of being present in the court to make a claim of their legal status to an immigration judge.
Those whom you can count on with no reason to help are soon deported.
According to employees of the shelters and messages from sources on the system that have appeared in the last months than longer children remain in prison, the more likely it is to be to develop depression or to increase anxiety, which may result in violent attacks or escape attempts.
Lawyers say that in larger institutions, such as Tarnille, these problems are much stronger, as the indications that the child is in a miserable state are likely to be ignored because of the size of the facility.
They're adding that moving children into random cities without allowing time for emotional preparation or for parting with friends can exacerbate the trauma that many have already encountered.
Syria Demands U.S., France, and Turkey's Immediate Output
In response to the AAN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem also urged the Syrian refugees to return home despite a war that continues in the country of eight years.
Mualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, has stated that foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally, on the ground of countering terror, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must go away and not put up any conditions," he said at the meeting of the Assembly.
He insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people had died since 2011, millions had to leave their homes, "the war with terror is practically over."
He reported that Damascus intends to continue "to fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
In Syria, there are about 2,000 U.S. military personnel, who are mainly instructors and advisors to the forces of Kurds and Syrian Arabs, who are in opposition to the President of Bashar Assad.
France's land contingent in this devastated war country is more than 1,000 soldiers.
On refugee issues, Mualem stated that the conditions for return are favourable and indictments by "some Western countries" in the "distribution of irrational fears" that keep refugees from abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to their return," he said.
"They are highly politicising a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped in restoring until a political agreement on the end of the war is reached between Assad and the opposition.
The AAN members report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last large rebel base of Idlib has created opportunities for political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement precipitated a wide-ranging attack by Syrian forces, supported by Russia on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had "exact deadlines", and hoped that military action would be directed against the jihads, including al-Qaida-related fighters, who would be "destroyed".
An AAN envoy, Stephan de Mistur, hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee in the near future, which will involve government representatives and oppositions to develop a successive constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
We had to do so by stating that the commission's work should be limited to a "review of articles of the current constitution" and a precaution against interference.
Why Trump will go for a second term
In this logic, Mr. Trump won the election in 2020 when, as many liberal viewers hope, the empire and the scandal do not do so in the future.
And this will no doubt be "The very dramatic finale of the presidency over the whole history!"
There is no sign of viewer fatigue at the moment.
Since 2014, premium ratings have increased more than twice – to 1.05 million on CNN and almost three times – to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, on Fox News, an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the transmission of "The Rachel Maddow Show" to MSNBC gathered 3.5 million viewers around the screen and exceeded cable television ratings in the evenings as they broadcast the main news.
"It's the fire that people are reaching out to because we don't understand it," said Neil Barr, director of the ABC drama "Resident" about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes president after the attack that the Capitol took down.
In Nelle Skewell, the mastic scriptwriter of comedies and the author of the book "A pair of funny details and some hard truths about penetration into the club of Hollywood boys," there is another theory.
She mentions a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
'Why?' she asked.
And he said, "Because he's fun to me," said Miss Skewell.
Chaos is precious even by what may amuse.
Of course, unlike all the rest of TV, the union lines coming out of Washington can become as specific a future as it is that of Row vs. Wade, it depends on whether the seven immigrants can get together and enjoy the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that only the most privileged watchers can afford.
However, when you watch for six hours that a group of experts discuss using Bob Woodward's "non-printing information" in the book Fear, Paul Manofort's $15,000 ostrich jacket, which is a matter of conceited pride, as described in The Washington Post, and the consequences of the harsh descriptions by Stom Daniels, um, Mr. Trump's anatomy, it goes beyond a simple frame of desire to be on the subject of trials.
I'll never look at Super Mary again, for instance.
"The part of what he does makes you feel as if you look at the reality of the show he shows every night," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and creator of Pawn Stars about the changing acting composition of Trump show and the constant rotations of the plot.
You can't afford to miss even one episode, or leave the class.
When I spoke to Mr. Flies this week, behind the windows of his house on the northern coast of Kauai there stood a hot sunny day and 30 degrees warm, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while writing CNN down.
He couldn't tear himself apart, not when Brett Cavanaugh stood up before the Senate Court of Justice, discussing the future of the Supreme Court, hanging in hair.
"I remember the girls when we did these crazy shows, and people said, "It's the beginning of the Western civilization," said Mr. Flace.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

External cash flows are fueled by a fierce pre-election race of intermediate elections in the heads of representatives
No wonder the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania caught up with the cash flow, thanks to the change in district boundaries introduced by Kangers, which is why two candidates take part in the one-stop elections.
The recently repopulated suburban Pittsburgh district of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lemba, who won his seat in another district on the edge of spring past.
Lambu opposes another acting deputy, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is now representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January determined that the voices of the old districts were unconstitutionally counted in favour of the Republicans.
The election race in the new 17th district has caused a decline in funding for the company by the financial groups of major parties, the Democratic Company Congress Committee (CRC) and the National Committee of the Republican Company (NCDC).
The Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a complex victory on a wide-litberics in the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
This place has been a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point district.
Political experts find that Democrats have a small advantage.
USA assessed the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China, then retreated
It was noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already supported Beijing in spite of a slight opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Warrell, in June 2017, and settled in a hotel in Panama until the partners moved out of Trump's steering team.
The representatives of the State Department decided to call off the American Heads of Diplomatic Missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in conjunction with “the recent decisions on Taiwan’s non-recognition”, said the press secretary of the Heather Nawert State Department earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only considered for El Salvador, which received about 140 million dollars of American aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The sanctions offered, including reduction of financial assistance and restrictions on visa issuance, would be painful for the country of Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
In order to conclude the internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed the holding of a high-level conference dedicated to security and economic prosperity, which would have been a continuation of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in efforts to prevent immigration from moving to the United States.
But by the middle of September the high-ranking representatives of the administration still realized that they wanted the conference to be held and actually to stop considering the question of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to the diplomats, Vice President Mike Pensionis will now speak at a conference scheduled for mid-October in symbol of the fact that the administration is in favour of holding an event.
And three American messengers without any extra noise returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh exiles or punishments from Washington.
The promoter of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates that were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues under the condition of maintaining anonymity.
These messages are confirmed by another user who wants to remain anonymous as well.
Read the history
The next step may be a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice in Mr. Trump's case, about which there is now very difficult evidence in public documents.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller drew attention to the investigation into the possibility that Trump and Russia would succeed in choosing.
When Kansas changes his master, Mr. Trump will prove to be in front of the face of responsibility before this body, just as he is about to speak again before the voters, and perhaps ultimately before the jury of his colleague.
There is a lot of cali, and I don't mean to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, just as it is in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make a choice which determines how long the struggle will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready for the coup d'état against Hitler, if only West had given him support and support for Chechaslavakia in Munich.
We have failed and missed the chance to avoid the next years of bloodshed.
The story twirls around similar turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or postponed.
Right now, Americans have faced some of these turning points.
What happens when Mr. Trump fires the deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein turned out to be in a difficult position since the paper wrote about what last year he offered to secretly write down the President's words and pondered his profitability.
Mr. Rosenstein says the message "The Times" is not correct.
"How will we react if the FBI's recent investigation of the Brett Cavanaugh case is not arbitrary or fair, or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court, in spite of trustworthy charges of sexual violence and irreparable testimony?
And above all, shall we vote in the elections for Kangaroo, which draws Mr. Trump to responsibility?
If we don't go through these trials, the long winter will come for democracy.
But I do believe we're not going to give up on the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Chechoslav Gabriela, who was deported in Asvencim by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my solitaire house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light a shabbat candle on that table with a swastika.
With such an inheritance as may I not be an optimist in relation to our future?"

Graham Dorans with Rangers Optimistically Set For the Before Battle of the Speed of Vienna
Rangers are taking Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that they will win the Austrians after the awesome midnight victory in Spain over Villaréal at the beginning of this month and will allow them to leave the G League of Europe.
The knee trauma prevented Graham Dorans from doing the first time in the season to no one's 2-2 with Villaréal, but he believes that Rangers will be able to use it as a tramp.
"It was an important match for us, because Villareal is a strong opponent," said 31-year-old football player.
"We started a game, thinking that I could get something, and we made a point.
We may have been able to kill the ball at the end, but nothing at all, too, has become a good result.
They looked best at the first secret, but in the second we took ourselves in hand, and we had the best half of a field.
There will be another major European soccer night on Thursday.
Hopefully we can earn three points, but that'll be a tricky game, because they showed good results in the last game, but given the crowd of staring stars on the stands, I'm sure we can manage them and show a good game.
Last year was determined by a hard time, both because of my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now we have a confidence factor.
The team is good and the boys are really enjoying the game; the training is proactive.
We hope we can move forward, we will stretch out the result of the past season, and we will succeed."
Women lose sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had an accurate idea of what they wanted to look after themselves, few of them talked about it with members of their families.
About half the people who participated in the public study said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking about it with their kids.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't take any steps to discuss it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationalwide on life insurance.
Here's what you got to start.
Keep that in mind with your husband and children: your family will not be ready to help you if you don't respond in advance.
Work with a consultant and a family and discuss where and how to get medical attention, since this can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Instill in the financial consultant's discussion. He can also help you find a way to pay the expenses.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy that helps cover these expenses or you can self-insured your life- -as long as you have money.
You've got legal papers to solve:
Get confidence on medical services to assign a trusted person to control your medical services and to ensure that you perform your wishes with specialists if you can't talk.
Besides, consider providing financial management with confidence.
Enter a person with confidence to make financial decisions and to secure the payment of your accounts if you are not allowed to.
Don't forget about the details: imagine your elderly father needs immediate medical attention, and he's on his way to hospital.
Can you answer questions about illicit drugs and allergies?
Type these details in writing to be ready.
"In addition to financial matters and professionalism of doctors," says Martin.
"What sort of drugs are needed?
Who will take care of the dog?
We have to schedule everything."
In an Ilfracombe a man has been shot several times with pneumatic rifles
The man got a few bumps from a pneumatic rifle when he was going home at night.
A 40-year-old man, who was in Oxford Grove District in Ilfracombe, Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 p.m. as a "accidental event".
The sufferings were not seen by the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, the police are asking witnesses to contact them.
An Earthquake and a Tsunami in Indonesia
According to the official figures, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that collapsed on Paul's Indonesian city on Friday, and it is expected that the number of deaths will occur.
Because of the disconnection of liaison, humanitarian aid workers were unable to obtain any information from Dongal's Regent, a region north of Paul, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter with a force of 7.5 points.
In the field, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after a disastrous disaster.
Here are some of the key facts about Paul and Dongal on the island of Sulawesi:
Paul is the capital city of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow cove on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 for 2017.
When the earthquake came and the tsunami came, it was celebrating the 40th anniversary of the establishment.
Donghal is a regent that stretches over 180 miles (300 km) of the shoreline in the northern west of Sulawesi Island.
The Regeny, the administrative unit under the rule of law, accounted for 299,200 persons in 2017.
Fishing and rural management are the main economics of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
Production of nickel is also important for the government, but most importantly, it is concentrated in Morala, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Mitigation, Paul and Dongal have been subjected to a tsunami several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, hundreds of houses were demolished in Dongalla from the tsunami.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donghal in 1996, resulting in the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is in a seismic-active Pacific fiery ring and it is regularly mutilated by earthquakes.
Below is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis during the last years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indian government of Acech in northern Sumatra on the 26th of December caused a tsunami of 14 countries, resulting in 226,000 deaths along the entire coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Acech.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes broke out on the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March at the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 took place in the south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, causing the tsunami to fall south of the coast, resulting in the death of some 700 people.
2009: In Padang, the capital of West Sumatra, there was a 7.6 - point earthquake.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-point earthquake took place on one of the Mentaway islands outside the Sumatran, causing a ten - foot [10 m] tsunami to kill about 300 people.
2016: Weak earthquake strikes the Podzi Jaya Regent in Acech, causing destruction and panic, as he reminds people of the devastation resulting from the 2004 deadly earthquake and the 2004 tsunami.
This time the tsunami did not come, but more than 100 people died under the ruins of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lambok Indonesia, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mainly in the north.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left a thousand tourists unoccupied.
Sarah Payne's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence in the family
Trek Paylin, the eldest son of the former Alaskan governor and vice-president at Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old named Paylin of Vasily, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, contradicting information about domestic violence and the arrests issued on Saturday by police in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report a alleged crime, he picked a telephone call from her.
On KTOU channel messages, Paylin is in Matanusk-Susit's next isolation room under a $500 bet.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "exactly innocent," when asked whether he would confess the guilt, the network reported.
Payline's being charged with three class A abuses, which threatens him to be deprived of his will for a period of up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He's also in charge of a class B crime charge, which is governed by a day's leave of absence and a $2,000 fine.
It was not the first case when against Paylin was put on charges.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Payne, called the police to tell her about the alleged attack.
The matter is now under consideration by the Alaskan veterans' court.
In January 2016, he had a domestic assault charge, a family rape report, and a state of alcohol-related possession of weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Paylin came under criticism from a group of veterans in 2016 for the complicity of her son's violent behaviour with post-traumatic syndrome caused by his service in Iraq.
Indian Earthquake, Tsunami: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed as a result of the earthquake on the Indian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-point earthquake called the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks do not work, and it is expected that in the coming days the number of victims will grow.
An earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, which is north-east of Jakarta, Indonesia's capital.
There were video clips in social networks showing the timing of the crash.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Paul's city when the tsunami set sail for the shore.
Federal Attorney's Office demands a rare death sentence for a suspected terrorist in New York City.
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Saifoul Saipow suspected of having been terrorized in New York City, resulting in the death of eight people -- a rare punishment that hasn't been used in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipas, 30 years old, in October, allegedly took advantage of a trucks truck from Home Depot to visit a bicycle road along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, bringing down pedestrians and bicycles in his path.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors have to prove that Saip 's intention to kill eight people and 'intentional' has caused serious bodily damage.
That's true of the court's materials, both of them for the possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the great federal follows the jury of St. Siip's by charging 22 counts, which included eight counts of murder in support of the racket; this paragraph is usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as the prosecution of violence and destruction of vehicles.
According to prosecutors, the attack required “old and deliberate planning” and, describing the crimes committed by Saipe, used such phrases as “disgusting, cruel and depraved”.
"Sifula Habibulaevich Saipla caused the injuries, caused the damage, and brought the loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Andjelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ana-Lory Dekadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernán Feruch, Hernán Diego Mendas, and Alejandro Damian Pagnek," he said in his communications of intent.
Five were tourists from Argentina.
Since the last prosecution of the death penalty case in South York City, ten years have passed.
Respondent Khaled Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug providers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence in New York on a federal case was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been punished after they had been convicted two years earlier for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union for the benefit of the Cold War.
Parar Rosenberg was punished in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saips, a quitter from Uzbekistan, according to court documents, demonstrated the absence of conscience reproaches on the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he stated by saying that he felt satisfaction from his act.
According to the prosecutor's indictment, he was told by the authorities that he was being attacked by the Islamic State video viewer on the phone.
He also requested permission to lift the flag of the Islamic State in a hospital ward reported to the police.
He doesn't find himself guilty of making a 22-point indictment.
David Patan, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipowa, said that they were “probably disappointed” with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision on the application of the death penalty, rather than on the life sentence without the possibility of being released, only increases the pain of these events for all the participants," said Patan.
The Saipawa Defence Team has previously asked prosecutors not to die.
A member of Parliament from Thora says Nigel Faraj must give talks on Brexit.
Today, during a protest at Torah Nigel Faradge's party conference, he swore to "mobilize the national army."
Former leader Ukip said politicians should "suspense the discomfort" from Eurosceptics, since one of the members of Parliament, Tereza May, offered his candidacy for EU talks.
A member of Parliament from the Peter Bone Conservatory Party said during a march in Birmingham that Britain would have “come out” if Mr. Faraz had held the post of secretary over Brexit.
But the problem that Mrs. May faced in trying to reconcile her distraught supporters was even worse when the Torahs, who are in favour of maintaining EU membership, have taken on a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister, of all efforts, is trying to maintain a compromise Cheker agreement under constant pressure from the supporters and supporters of the exit, as well as from the EU itself.
The allies insist on trying to close a deal with Brussels despite the negative reaction, and they want to force Eurosceptics and lawyers to choose between her package and "the mess".
Mr. Boone said at a rally in Salihal, "Leave Means Leave" that he wants to "cut Cheker off the board".
He suggested that Master Faraj should make equal and impose obligations on him for the talks with Brussels.
"If it were important for us to leave already," he said.
A member of Parliament from Velingboro said, "I'm for Brexit, but we have to get away from the Cheker Plan."
Addressing the EU, he said, "We did not wage world wars to be dependent.
We want to do our own laws in our country."
Mr Bone dismissed the assumption that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain completely does not meet the reality."
Brixit's admirer and Torra's member, Andrea Jenkins, was also on the march, and in a conversation with journalists, she said, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to people.
"The Cheker Plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and activists who actually go out and pick us.
Please abandon the plan and start listening."
In a brief address to Mistress May, she added, "The prime ministers remain in the seat when they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraj said that politicians should be forced to “feel uncomfortable” when they are about to betray the solution adopted at the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us -- peoples and politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say to them, "That doesn't work for you."
In his speech to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to make our politicians, who are ready to betray Brexit, feel uncomfortable.
"We mobilise the people's army of this country, which has given us victory in Brixia, and we will never rest until we are independent, self-governed, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile the officials of the exit went through Birmingham before performing a two-hour rally in the middle of town.
Several activists waving banners at Tories Against Brexit after starting a group this weekend.
The Labour Lord Adniss was struck by conservators for security issues they had encountered because of the party program when the conference was opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have ready to use the IT system and all the technology for Canada plus, for the cut-off border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It is a complete farce.
A thing like good Brixit. There is no such thing," he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the president's chat process
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the elections in November she will "pay close attention to the process of balloting with the President".
"The Boston Globe" reports that democracy from Massachusetts on Saturday spoke of its future at a general meeting in West Massachusetts.
Warren, the frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is going to re-election, is opposed by a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Dzil, who was the parent of Trump's company in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was the center of discussions as the possible Trump rival in 2020.
Since Trump's introduction, it's been a 36th meeting with voters in the form of a general meeting that's been held on Saturday afternoon in Khalieuk.
One of the participants asked if she plans to chat on the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for "a woman to go to Washington to correct a broken government, and for that a woman must stand at the head."
Christ took place after the death of the basketball player Sims from the University of Louisiana
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, charged on Saturday that suspected basketball killer W.S.W. Wade Sims was arrested on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police office announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dittan Simpsan during a press conference that was held at 11 a.m. in the middle of the morning.
On Friday they published a video recording of the shooting, asking for help in identifying the man who was on it.
A 20-year-old Sims was shot on a Friday morning at a South University campus.
"Waid Sims received a gunshot wound to the head as a result of which he died," channel journalist "247sports" said police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade stood up for a friend and was shot by the Simpsons.
In the course of questioning, Simpson admitted that he was at the scene of the crime, was armed and shot at by Wade Sims.
Simpson did not cooperate at the arrest and was taken into custody in the police administration of the district of East Baton Rouge.
Sportsman Jr. grew up 6 feet, 6 inches (201 cm) in Baton Rouge, Sims last season played 32 games, of which 10 were on the ground at the beginning, in the middle rights on the field 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points, and made 2.9 picks for the game.
Gran Near Russia: Lewis Hamilton came close to the title of champion of the world after, by the intra-commandal agreement, winning the victory over Sebastian Fethel
Since Walter Botas was assigned on Saturday to the qualifying set-up of Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that the orders within the Mercedes team play a significant role in the race.
Boots pulled out a good place on the crane and nearly left Hamilton on the loose of the fate until he defended his place on the first two faiths and invited the Fetel to attack his friend by command.
Fetelle first went on to a pit-stop and left Hamilton babbling at the end of a common mass of potters, which was exactly what the manoeuvre was to become decisive.
The Mercedes pilot went on a pit stop later and walked out behind Fetel, but Hamilton came forward after several wheel-and-wheel manoeuvres that forced Ferrari to leave the interior space free, risking to hold back after a double manoeuvre to defend himself at the third turn.
Max Ferstapin started off with a series of networks on his 21st birthday and by the end of the first round he was in seventh place.
Then he led most of the race as they held their necks, for he wanted to quickly finish, overtake Kim Ricanen and take the fourth place.
As a result, he left at a pit stop on the 44th circle, but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight circles, so Ryann took the fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because Walter had made all the outgoing speeches fantastic and had made himself a real gentleman if I was allowed to say so.
"The command has done an extraordinary job to take the first and second places," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dian Finnstein at a rally Saturday because she insisted that she was not the source of the leak of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which she accused the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavan in sexual violence.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to the indications, the Ford data before the Senate Court of Justice, commenting instead that what was happening in the Senate had shown how people could be "scrupulous, despicable and unjust".
"What can happen and what's going on in the last few days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see angry, dirty, and lying people," he said.
"When you read about press releases and escapes, and then they said, 'Oh, I didn't.
It isn't me."
Remember?
Dean Finestein, is that your escape?
Remember her answer... you lost the document--'oh, oh, what?
No, no.
I had nothing."
Wait a minute.
We let a diversion -- no, we wouldn't let it," he added, ordered the senator.
A letter was sent to the University of Leipzig with a detailed presentation of the charges filed by Ford against Cavanaugh and he fled in early September -- but Fainstein denied that the fugitive had taken place from her office.
"I did not hide the blames of Dr. Ford, I did not allow her to escape," said the Financial Committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked that the story remain confidential and I accepted her request."
But her denial probably didn't like the President who so much commented during Saturday's rally: "This is what I'm going to tell you, it was a really bad language body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen!"
By pursuing the defense of a candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president assumed that Democrats were using charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You can see the subject, the measure, and no matter who they're hurting, through whom they have to transgress to gain power and control,” is the words of the President, "Mediate".
Elite League: Dandi Stars – Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Duaire killed two pings for Jayants in a match against Dandy
Dandy Stars played for the Friday coup they had inflicted on them by Belfast Giants in the Elite League, winning a 5-3 return match at home on Saturday.
Thanks to Patrick Dwyer's blow and Francis Baville Jayants were led on by two pucks in the beginning.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney leveled the number before Duaire recovered the Giants' leadership.
François Bushard of Dundee leveled the number, after which Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured the team with two heads.
It became the third time in the Elite League for the Adam Keefe team to beat Dundee with a 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met on the fourth time in the season; in the previous three games, the Giants won.
The first goal of the fourth minute of the match (03:35) was killed by Duyer in a Kendall McFol hit, and four more minutes later, he doubled the number after David Rutherford's hit.
At the first time (13:10) Sullivan opened up a number on the part of the masters of the field, and then Coon leveled the number after Matt Markwardt's transfer.
Duaire secured the Giants' leadership upon leaving at first break, killing his second girlfriend at the end of the first period.
Taking the side regrouped, and Bushard again aligned the account by killing the scab on the numbered transfer of the command (27:37).
Coon and Charles Carcoran helped Nielsen get Dundee to lead the first match at the end of the second period, and he secured a win with the fifth team number in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four since the last five meetings, are playing the last game on domestic ground against Milton Kanes on Friday.
A plane pilot gets killed, saving hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
A plane pilot in Indonesia died heroically, securing a successful flight of a plane with hundreds of passengers aboard.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared without news after the massive earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday, which caused the tsunami.
Heavy underground jolts are still going on, and many people buried under rubble in the city of Paul.
While his colleagues were fleeing, 21-year-old Antonius Gunnavan Agung refused to leave his post in the dispatcher's highlands, which rushed wildly into the airport of Paul Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He remained on the spot until the Bayk Air, which was in the moment on the runway, broke out of the ground.
Then he sprang out of the dispatches, when he decided she would break down.
Later he died in the hospital.
According to the Australian program ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesia, the dispatcher's solution may have saved hundreds of lives.
We had to get the helicopter out of Balikopan to Kalimantana, which had to transport it to a more large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter flew to Paul.
"Our hearts are broken," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities of the country are concerned that the number of victims can reach several thousand, and agencies that reduce the risk of disaster claim that access to Dongala, Siggy and Button are restricted.
Sotopa Purvo Nugroha's spokesman said, "Perhaps the number of victims will still increase, as many bodies have not yet been able to dig from under the rubble."
The waves which had reached six metres had devastated Paul, where a massive burial would take place Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft will double their humanitarian aid.
Ryssa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, Sky News reported: "Every minute, the car comes in hot.
Clean water's not enough.
"In other words, goods are used only for retail purposes."
Jan Helfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said "CNN": "The Indonesian Red Cross has a hurry to help those who have survived, but we don't know what's waiting for them here.
It is already a tragedy, but everything can become much worse."
Indonesian President Jock Odod arrived in Paul on Sunday and said to the soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready? « — reports the CNN».
Earlier this year, in Indonesia, more than 550 people were killed by earthquakes in Lamboca.
A plane crash in Micronesia: on the message of Air Niugini one person passed without a message after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight which had made the crash landing in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, had previously stated that all 47 passengers and the team had successfully evacuated from the plane that was melting, and now declares the disappearance without a word of a single passenger.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that, on Saturday's condition, it could not report the whereabouts of a single male passenger.
Aviacampia reported that she works with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find a man.
The airline did not immediately report the details of the passenger; for example, its age and nationality.
The local boats helped save the rest of the passengers and the team after landing the plane on water while trying to land at the airport of Chuk Island.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people were hospitalized.
The airline reported that six passengers were left in hospital on Saturday; they were all in stable condition.
The reason for the rotation, as well as the exact sequence of events, are unexplained.
By statements both the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in a lagoon, without going to the passage.
By messages of some witnesses, the plane had jumped over the passage.
According to American passenger Bill Janes, the plane flew very low.
"That's very successful," said Jane.
According to him, he and others were able to walk through the belt in the water towards the emergency exits of the plane, which had already waned.
He said that the carriageways had panicked and begun shouting, and that he had got a slight trauma to the head.
USS U.S.A. reports that mariners who were planning a nearby wharf also helped escape using a puffed-up boat to transport people on shore until the plane sank to depths of about 100 feet (30 m).
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people were killed when they were registered in Papua New Guinea for the last twenty years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
An analyst recovers the course of events in the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday the indictment ended with the presentation of evidence in a review of the case of a man who is accused of burning the resident of Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Roulet, for a few hours gave an indication as being involved in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to find out the movements of a 29-year-old defendant named Quintana Tellis and a 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Roulette reported that he had received information about a place from several mobile phones which showed that Telis had been with Chambers the night she died that contradicted his previous claim.
When data that his cell phone was near Chambers' phone while, according to his assertion, he was with his friend Michael Sandford confirmed, the police were going to ask Sanfard to marry him.
Sanford gave an indication Saturday and confirmed that he had not been in the city that day.
When the aside of the indictment asked, did Telis tell the truth about Sandford being in the van that night, he said that he was "nodding, as my van was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was Tellis' claim that he was familiar with Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records showed that they knew each other every week.
According to Roulet, some time after Chambers Tellis' death, she got her messages, calls, and contacts off her phone.
"He wiped it out with his life," said Haley.
A side of the defense must begin a dispute of sides a Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be referred to the jury later on the same day.

More Niggers?!
A New York nanny goes into marriage for a "racist" message after being released
A New York nanny goes into court for discriminating dismissal after receiving an accidentally sent message from her mother with a complaint that she's "another black woman".
So what they're saying is, they're racist, they're comparing positions to "training."
In 2016, Lindsay Plasca-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment at finding that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, was blacklisted when she arrived on her first working day.
“NOEOO, I'M A CHARKICULOUS ONE,” wrote Mrs. Plaska-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she twice sent a message to Miss Morris.
As New York Post reported, with the understanding of the error, Plaska-Flaxman dismissed Miss Morris, claiming that the former nanny, who was also an African-American, had been ill at work, and had waited instead for her Filipino.
Miss Morris paid for his day of work and sent home to Uber.
Now, Morris is a couple in the court, and he wants compensation for the dismissal, according to the conditions under which she was initially hired, although without contract: $350 a day for six months living.
"I want to show them that this can't be done," she said on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denied the accusation of racism, arguing that Morris' dismissal was a reasonable decision, considering that they could not trust her after they insulted her.
'My wife sent her what she wasn't supposed to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist,'''Post said the husband,' Joel Plaska.
'Would you trust your children who you treated rudely, let them even chance?'
His Majesty?
Is it?'
The flat is equal to the pay-as-you-go, and reports that his wife had been born just two months ago and had been in a "very complicated situation".
'And will you become a hunted man in that position?
It's rather harsh," added a specialist in investment-banking activity.
While the trial process was still on, public opinion soon condemned marriage in social networks, raising the harsh criticism of their behaviour and logic.
Sundington's publishers were afraid that readers would not overuse the talking bear as they speak in a new leaf
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, wrote of a letter, "It's hard to put herself in the place of the one who reads it first before it will be published.
It's so interesting to read, already knowing Podsignan's great success."
She said that her father, who had been working for the BBC before he dared to write a book for children about a little toy bear, was optimistic in spite of the fact that his work had not been taken and added that the 60th year of publishing the books was a "greek-sweet" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his final success by referring to the Podingtan, which she described as "a very important member of our family."
"He was a pretty quiet man and quite un bragging," she said.
'But since Podlington was so real to him, it was almost a parental pride for a child who had something to do with it: thou art proud of them, though it is not really your merit.
I think he was considering the success of Podsignan just in such a key.
Though it was his creature, the product of his imagination, he always gave it to the Podlingtan himself."
My daughter died and I had to meet her on the phone
After landing her daughter was delivered to Louis Pasteur's Hospital 2, where doctors in vain fought for her life.
"There was a regular call to tell you that everything was really bad that she couldn't handle," said Mrs. Edon-Laperuse.
"Then I rang over to say that she would die for the next two minutes, and I had to part with her.
And I did it.
I said, "Daddy, I love you so, so, so sweet.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave to beat her heart were slowly leaving her body.
She died a little while ago, and this was the end of it all.
I just had to sit there knowing that everything was turned around.
I could neither groan nor cry, for there were families and people around me.
I had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Edon-Laperuse, who had suffered the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers -- and they didn't know at all what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
'I tilted my head and my face all the time with my tears running.
It was hard to explain, but it was in the summer that I was gripped by Ned's compassion.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her."
Women who grieve putting out cards to warn themselves suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones who have committed suicide are doing their best to keep other people alive.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put up cards with warm words and telephone numbers that people can get help on a bridge in Wales.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13, when he began his depression, and at age 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel the way I feel," she said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Leeds, said that her son was a talented chief-in-chief with an infectious smile.
'Everybody knew his smile.
People said his smile would light up any room."
But before death he quit his work, for he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11, found his brother's body when he ended his suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried about the unpleasant consequences."
Mrs. Davis has created cards "to let people know that there are persons in the world that you can contact and talk to even if you are a friend.
Don't stay quiet; you have to talk."
Mrs. Hasfris, who has been friends for many years with Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner, who lived with him for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was sad or that he's depressed or anything," she said.
"For a few days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On a holiday day he was very depressed: when the children opened presents he did not even look at them."
She said his death was for their great trauma, but it was necessary to live with it: 'A huge hole has come into the family.
It is just killing us.
But we have to keep living and fighting."

Future Brett Cavanaugh is not sure because the FBI is starting to investigate.
"I thought we could have what he wanted -- limited in time and in the scope of the investigation -- we could get a bit of a union," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee was breaking down because it had actually fallen into traffic.
Why would Mr. Kawano and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is justified sometimes.
Temporary selections only five weeks later, the 6th of November -- if the Republicans are expected to suffer from the fall, then they will be weakened in their attempts to select a candidate to the Supreme Court.
George Bush called the senator to seek the support of Lord Cavanaugh, who worked in the White House during the Bush presidency and through him introduced himself to his wife Ashley, who then worked as a private secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now sitting.
I don't know yet if Mr. Kawano is going to get 50 votes while voting in the Senate that he'll allow Vice President Mike Pens to settle the issue of equal vote and confirm it with the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea fell under Kim's direction
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Chen-Yun came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean official.
Park Bo Sun, bringing data from the South Korean Ministry in conjunction, stated that last year there were 1,127 defectors, and in 2011 there were 2706.
Mr. Park stated that the main reasons behind that were the strengthened memory control between North Korea and China and the higher costs that smugglers had incurred over the transfer.
Pyongyang had nothing to do with it.
Most of the refugees from the north with the challenge of getting South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Korean residents illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people run through China, which is the longest border in North Korea, and it's much more likely to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans, which is very much around.
China sees defectors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and is often forced to repatriate them.
The relations between North and South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks concerning denuclearization.
This happened after the historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen-Yin in June in Singapore, when they agreed to work on a common basis to fully liberate the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ian Ho, accused US sanctions in the absence of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these conditions we are not going to disarm first," said Mr. Ry in a speech at the General Assembly of AAN in New York.
Nancy Pelozy called Brett Cavanaugh a "scientist," she said he shouldn't work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in Nancy Pelozy's House of Representatives called the candidate in the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh a “systemist” and stated that according to his temperature he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelozy said it on Saturday for the Texas Tribune festival edition in Austin, Texas.
"I could not get rid of the idea that if that was the way a woman behaved, she would be called "theistrel," which Pelosi made a reaction to the Kawano speech before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
The coffee was emotionally against charges of sexual harassment against Christine Blasey Ford's doctor when they were still teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotive, sometimes even shouting and couldn't talk when his family and senior classes of school discussed.
He also explicitly accused the democrats of the committee of accusing him of being a "gracious and organised manslaughter" organised by liberals who were angry at the fact that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that he believed that Kavanaugh's speech had shown that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he clearly indicated that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I believe he disqualified himself by his statements and by the manner in which he spoke about the Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected if they asked her if she would try to embodi Kavanaugh if they chose him and when the Democrats would get the majority of the House of Representatives.
"I will say this -- if he doesn't speak the truth in Cangress or the FBI, he doesn't only have to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," Pelozy said.
At this point, Kavanaugh is the judge at the district appeals court in Columbia County.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she was concerned about Kawano's potential decisions against the law on affordable medicine or the Row vs. Wade case, because Kavanaugh was considered a conservative judge.
At the hearings following confirmations at the Kavanaugh plant, he did not answer questions whether he would cancel certain Supreme Court rulings.
"Now is not the time for an hysterical, unbiased person to work in court and expect us to say 'how wonderful,' said Pelozy.
And a woman must know that.
It's a true prosecution speech, months and years of anger just pours out, and she can't remember it without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years ago.
"I don't think it's such a rarity."
She kept on: "I was very much assisted by a woman who worked somewhere by the director, who said, when she was angry, she cried out, but she worked her behavioral techniques, and when she got angry and started crying, she said, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And I just kept talking.
I believe it was great."
Tears are allowed in part as a way out of the sum because they're absolutely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of the first job I once cried out with unspeakable anger, and I was grabbed by a collar by an elderly woman, a restrained principal, who always scared me a little, and dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you in tears," she said.
"They don't know that you're angry.
They think thee sorrowfully and will be glad what hath brought thee."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Congolese Democrat from Colorado, worked with Harry Hart in a presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt took a stand on a yacht called Monkey Business and left the presidential race, a very angry Mrs. Schroeder believed that she could participate in the presidential campaign herself.
"It wasn't a very well thought out decision," she said to me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates, and they did not need me at all.
Someone named this situation "The Whiteman and the Seven Dwarves."
Since the campaign had been going on for quite some time, she had missed out on funds, so she said she wouldn't take part in the election unless she got $2 million.
It was a losing situation.
It turns out that some of her supporters, who had sacrificed $1,000 to a man, only gave her $250.
"They think I am going down?" she thought.
When she made the statement that she would not participate in the election campaign, she was so caught up in the emotions -- thanks to the people who supported her, the anger at the system, which made it so difficult to get money and be directed to voters, not to candidates, and the anger at sexism -- that she caught her breath.
"You might think I've got a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroed a press reaction to her condition.
"It might have been thought that my corporate sponsor is a paper-surrender manufacturer of Kleenex.
I used to think they'd write on my supervillain?
"She cried?"
Why the trade war between China and the United States could be good for Beijing
The first valves of trade between China and the United States were deafening, and since war is far from completion, in a far more distant perspective of misunderstandings between countries might be in the favor of Beijing, experts say.
The President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, fired his first warning at the beginning of this year, taxing China's main export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week when new fares touched goods worth a total of $200 billion (150 billion), actually taxing half of the goods in the United States of China.
Every time Beijing responded in the same way, raising recently the fare from five to ten percent for American goods at $60 billion.
China of the United States is symmetrical, and the second largest economy is hardly going to lead to an eye.
In order to get Washington back, you need to take a deeper look at the demand, but public propensity before the United States is practically unacceptable for China's C.P. leader.
However, experts say that if Beijing is using the situation correctly, the US trade war pressure in the distant perspective can support China by reducing the interdependence of these two countries.
"The fact that the rapid political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will begin the process of a sudden economic fall is much more dangerous than the observers had before," stated Abigail Grace, assistant researcher specializing in Asia, in the research-analytical centre of the new American security.
"Syria ready" to go back to the refugees, said the foreign minister
Syria declares that it is ready for the return of the refugees and calls for help in the reconstruction of a war-torn country that lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the AAN General Assembly, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Al-Mualem stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure, thanks to progress in the fight against terror," he said.
The government continues to restore areas devastated by terrorists to return to normal life.
Now we have all the conditions for bringing the refugees back to the country that they were forced to leave because of the terror and economic measures that were aimed at improving their daily lives and livelihoods.
The BAS believes that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the 2011 war.
Six more million living in the country require humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would gladly receive assistance to rebuild a devastated country.
However, he stressed that the country would not receive assistance in exchange for certain conditions or assistance from countries that had panicked rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cube in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by winning the US team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in Paris, France.
The US has been playing six times in a row on European soil and has not played Ryder's cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe got a crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team gained 14.5 points needed to win the US.
American star Phil Michelson, who was most likely in the tournaments, drove his ball into the water by the 3rd pair of 16 holes, stepping down this match of Francesca Mallinaires.
The Italian Gulfist Malinars played beautifully on all rounds, making it one of the four players who had passed this field with a number of 5-0-0-0 since the beginning of the Tuner in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spies was kicked out with a number of 5 and 4 players with the lowest rating on a European team, Thornbourne Olsen from Denmark.
The world's biggest player, Justin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Pollter in England, who may have played in his last cup of Ryder.
An eight-cup veteran of Ryder's Spanishman Sergio Garcia has become a player who has more than all the winnings in a 25.5-point tournament.
"Of course I don't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a hard year.
I very grateful Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to return the cup.
The whole thing is on the team, and I'm glad I could help," said uproaring Garcia after winning the European team.
He gave his countryman John Ram, who on Sunday played the legend of American golf by Tiger Woods in single matches 2-1.
"I'm very proud to have won Tiger Woods, the man whose career it was as a child," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now has a record number of 13-21-3 to the Ryder cup.
The strange statistic of one of the biggest players of all time who has won 14 major titles and backs up this score just from Jack Niklaus.
The American team fought with itself except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tney Finnow, who had been playing throughout the tournament at the top of his class golf game.
American Captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing game in defense of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they're fables.
We sometimes showed Europe this morning what we could do.
We fought.
Take your hat off to Thomas' honor.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the American Golf Association and our commission on the Ryder Cup, and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take off your hat before them.
We've been played."
