The triumph of right populists in Austria, combined with 29 percent
The targeted weakening of both sides of the current large coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have resulted in Sunday's early parliamentary elections in Austria, according to the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the election leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Korutan Haytman Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the country's strongest social democracy (SPÖ) remains with 29.8 per cent of the vote, but is losing 5.5 per cent of the vote against the last elections in 2006.
Worse still, ÖVP is losing 25.6 percent of its votes.
These are the worst results of both of these large parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially in the case of early polling people, they are literally a disastrous result.
As early as July, when ÖVP stepped out of the coalition, the people had a significant lead in favour of SPÖ.
Obviously, however, the voters punished them for letting the government fail.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations about the possible resignation of party president and former Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer have already emerged.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Party's Presidency.
Such a development would likely facilitate the way towards an increasingly likely exit from the electoral result, namely the renewal of the Grand Coalition SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties, the free (FPÖ) received 18% in advance and 11% of the votes of BZÖ, but the Social Democrats also voiced concerns about the repetition of 1999 when the people agreed with the populace (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005, it split away from BZÖ) in a joint government that even sparked sanctions by the European Union.
Apparently Haider is betting on this development, which has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party and anticipates a return to Vienna to national policy.
There was another Green Party to the parliament, which was easily lost and fell among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
None of the other parties clearly had a four-percent border and did not reach parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India Can Cool Off
If the problem could not be solved with the Czech scientists who were accused in India of illegally collecting bugs, there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
The minister reported it in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranabe Mukhherj.
"If it hadn't been resolved, then yes, then there would have been some cooling," he said after the meeting that took place from the Czech initiative.
Mukherji said after the hearing that in judicial matters, executive power can hardly interfere.
However, he stated that in the case of Peter Schvácha, who was acquitted and punished by a fine, the Central Government could deal with the local government in Darjiling, whose jurisdiction the matter falls into.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
It would be best for Emil Kucher, sentenced to three years in prison, according to Mukherji, to appeal to a higher instance.
He could then apply for bail and wait for his sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself the same way during the negotiations.
"It recommends an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech party can enter the whole matter is to provide the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian Minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance had already been provided by the Indian side.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining the best relations with India that have a long tradition.
The Indians also acknowledge this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as the Czech Republic said, before its partner, it stressed that the problem of Czech entomologists is of great importance.
"We consider indeed a grave error in the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists," he declared.
Answering the question of whether he had received a commitment from the Indian party to deal with things, the minister avoided himself.
"I've got quite a lot of promises," he said only.
Czech judges the battle for the seabed
It will join the walled electronic map on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are depicted.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and, along with it, the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member UN Division staff for Ocean Affairs and Maritime Law.
His chief, division director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, monitors and occasionally completes the interpretation.
There's a working talent and enthusiasm in this place.
The seabed hides a little known world rich in natural resources.
You can find oil, ores and other non-nutrient raw materials, but also yet unknown living organisms that carry the key to developing a cure for cancer.
The bottom is larger than the ground
Today, coastal states began to resort to a new submarine territory in a vehement way.
According to the UN Convention, they exercise their rights under which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so - called continental shell, which often ranges up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
She has an exclusive right under the Convention to all sources of continental silhouette.
"Simplely speaking, the continental shelf has the part of the sea floor and its floor, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It goes beyond the coastline, often beyond the two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the determination of the outer limits of the continental shell must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of a number of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three of the last-mentioned countries have succeeded so far," Mikulka adds.
A recent success in Australia was recorded by the World Voices, which first significantly expanded its submarine countries.
However, New Zealand - the seabed area that the Commission admitted to him last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the survey.
In the future, the profit that comes from using the seabed will be invaluable, as they promise.
It shall progressively submit its requests to other States.
They can do so not until ten years after they ratified the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor begins, a convention declared "the common heritage of mankind".
No State has an exclusive position here.
The law of exploitation in this field confers a Convention on established international institutions.
"The bottom of the sea is not a Klondike," Mikulka says in an oversupply that his "united areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually anchored".
Czechs in the Pacific
Today the Czech Republic is part of the seabed.
They are shared with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the Joint Organisation "Interoceanmetal".
It was acquired by the Convention in 1991, as were the investors of several other states, the status of the so-called "properly investor".
It has the right to exercise in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, lying between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The investor's research area is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is broken, it's some kind of sub-sea replica of Tater.
"It can be used on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich location of polymetallic nodules containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan," says another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Ryan.
Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev brings one of these concepts to the show.
It reminds me of a little potato or, in a little fantasy, a fabulous seam, which, according to legend, brought Golem back to life.
Germany's special deployment units were free of hostages
The Egyptian government has requested assistance from Germany in resolving the crisis with hostages - experts have arrived.
When the situation deteriorated, the special units were ready, but there was no deployment.
Further details of the emancipation of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are gradually received.
According to the Ministry of Defence and Home Affairs, the German special forces were also directly involved.
According to the ministries, both members of the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German Police GSG9, pilots of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were on the spot.
However, according to another announcement by the two ministries from Monday afternoon, the German forces were not required because the kidnappers had let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized signs of forced liberation.
According to the Egyptian government, the aid offered by Germany was adopted as support for the on-the-spot action.
"Unfortunately it has not happened," said one of the spokesmans of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers composed of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanians, and eight of their Egyptian guides on 19 September in the south of Egypt.
After kidnapping in desert areas in southern Egypt, hostages were moved to border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
At present, the rescues are in order in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the release of hostages is in the care of the German embassy.
He didn't comment on the details of the release.
There is no information yet available in Berlin when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to Bild, all five tourists should fly with special forces to one of the Airbuses of the German Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The American House of Representatives rejected the rescue package
The first chamber of the American Congress has let the bailout for the financial markets of $700 billion fall close mostly.
The Dow Jones Index went a long way down.
In 206 votes to 227, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both sides, there was no majority for a programme to alleviate the chaos of the financial markets.
Dramatic action has been desperately trying to convince critics of a $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called on the Member to give his consent before the vote, even though he said the plan was not popular.
"It is difficult to gain political recognition for avoiding something that has never happened before," he admitted.
Even during the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason was the investor's concern that the state rescue package might fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index had been raised so that after the notification of the loss of the package would fall steeply again.
Experts are now counting on other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, the approval of the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Travel agents record increasing number of reservations
It seems that winter will be good for German entrepreneurs in tourism:
According to one study, there was a significant increase in the number of trips for the next month compared to the previous year - even more than 30 percent in the winter season.
Despite the weak economic growth, the taste of the Germans remains unmitigated.
For winter season reservations, travel agencies have seen an increase of 31 percent compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Union (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, an increased number of reservations are available for autumn months.
The turnover was thus, according to DRV, in October compared to 2007 by about 11 per cent higher.
The results are based on GfK numbers, which evaluates each month the booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and interpolates them on the total market.
This result included the booking of tours that took place by the end of August 2008.
Due to a weak dollar exchange, the preferred route is to the US, according to DRV.
On these roads, it makes an increase in reservations about one-third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece are particularly desirable targets for Germans, as well as for domestic water.
Mainly organised tours are in the course, according to the chairman of DRV Klaus Laepple.
With regard to rising spending on energy and food, here are the costs "for the customer is easier to calculate than for the individual organised holiday".
Laepple explained that money can, among other things, save consumers by using discounts for early booking or full-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so more turnover will be recorded compared to the previous year - even though according to another study the number of Germans who made some journeys has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Over and over again, a beer made of blunts and prominents in cuts from known designers.
For the first time in a beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, television moderator, and she's wearing a stitched cut.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we're not even three minutes out on the beer meadow, and we're already being dumped by photographers and fast-filled memory cards - that's flattering to me, because I'm on Octoberfest for the first time.
That's how you make friends.
It seems my cheap cut has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equation, so my sense of comfort in the cut was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwies, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a woman's dress or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassedly affected - everything is completely normal.
Special views of the banana stand in chocolate only reap my apron.
One nun reminds me that I wrongly tied her up, "You're free in the middle of the virgin, on the right hand, widowed in the back."
I'm gonna flip them over to the back of the left.
"All right," he says, and he laughs.
Others with subtle flirtative techniques do not care so much, and they wear simple flat hats with the words "This nose to get dressed!" and push on passing naked asses.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is named Bob, came from England, and came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
Seems "gorgeous" to him, with an extended "oo."
That's what he tells me after he's drunk.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are garbage bins.
So Bob is one of the feared Wildbieslers, as in Bavaria is called in public by the freely urinating people.
Others are not fortunate enough to get rid of alcohol that way.
Around 8:00 p.m., they run around the area where Oktoberfest is being held, in a rush of health care workers who have to take care of poor drinkers.
The doctors always show up in the flock - in four wearing covered stretchers from tent to tent.
They function like most visitors to beer meadows: empty there, full back.
Whoever's lying under the sail of this vessel of impreciseness cannot be seen.
"That's the one that can't go on," one of the doctors will call me in answer to my question and disappear into the crowd.
Police have released the name of the victim of the accident
The name of a 23-year-old woman who died in the hospital after being hit by a car in Essex was published.
An accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon hit Carole Paulson from the Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, an 11 - year - old man was arrested for suspicion of reckless driving.
He's already been released on police bail.
Turkish diplomatic horizons expand
Long before Turkey began to seek entry into the European Union, European powers sought to penetrate deep into the Turkish border.
On the eastern shore of Bosporus, perhaps just twenty steps in Asia, is one of the best monuments of this unsuccessful imperial ambition.
Hydarpas railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Cone in neo-renaissance style.
That's what the tour guide will tell you.
The building sits at the end of the platform with a tower at each corner of the front, looking at the ignorance of a provincial German town hall.
The stone's dirty.
The whole building is falling apart.
But once a man gets inside a jeweled treasure chest, he can no longer have doubts about the size of the company whose most western gate of the station was.
In August 1908 the station opened a German consortium of Anatoli-Bagdadian corporations.
Germany, which had become involved in the game of empires late, had in mind its ambition to control the Middle East through this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative insulation from surrounding areas, created by frozen cold war borders, is gone
British and colonial troops marched out of Egypt and pushed Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And bad news also came to the station of Hydarpash.
In 1917, he destroyed the ammunition train's explosive roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Ever since then, she's been slobbering and history haunting her.
Today, however, this gateway to Anatolia and beyond serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Party Justice and Development - ACP - has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by frozen Cold War borders, is gone.
A new policy is now being implemented - Turkey is engaging.
It is remarkable that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, Iraq and Iran, and, of course, the European Union and the United States.
In order to examine the parameters of this new policy, I boarded a night train to Ankara's Turkish capital, where I was to meet one of the ACP's leading experts on foreign policy, Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a curvy ride along the tracks that reminded of the ancient world beats of the famous Night’s Mail document, I arrived at the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its Ottoman past back.
However, the ACP, with its well-known Islamic roots, represents a shift in the paradigm of the Turkish consensus.
In the west, she raised suspicions, especially in Washington.
Taxik brought me to the main AKP apartment, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built in the developing suburbs, surrounded by half-deposited commercial houses and merchants in power, where middle managers in business clothes - men and women - meet to do early morning shops.
Suat Kiniclioglu could easily be a centre-right policy from almost every other European political party.
The jacket, the tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry, too.
"The aim of the foreign policy of the party is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its borders.
Today they must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
It had to do both.
"But surely the moment will come," I asked, "when might Turkey have to decide?"
"Turcko," he said, "you didn't want this decision to happen."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost memorized: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea are as much for the benefit of Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, Europe, as a whole, seems to be able, metaphorically speaking, to take these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpas station, after another most awake night, I was thinking of those two German lords Herr Ritter and Herr Cone who watched this building build a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be in Turkey's hands, for the most part.
And when I was waiting at the port for a ferry back across Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least then there were not many doubts which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Remarkable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a Guildford music leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrolog, September 11th) was the head of Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district musical plan, the year was founded by the fine body of young Proteus.
He was to be 21 years old, but at the time of Proteus ’ last singing in 1979, there were some of us almost 30 — we simply refused to give up the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape changer) represented the willingness and ability of the congregation to engage in any music that was presented to it - be it madrigali or Messiaen, either alone or with the entire orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young congregation was often overwhelming, always exciting, all thanks to the inspiration of the only man and the enthusiasm for music, which remained completely unchanged throughout the time.
How often only Todd told us to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Sing it, then!
His tactical technique was perfectly clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor Mayan.
Wherever the music standard was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If there was to be any conductor fit on the knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when he directed Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed with any of them - and I have been inspired many times.
Todd Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, according to him, simply "were dragging one or two leaky furnaces around the world".
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary William Woodruff (September 25th) claims that "in 1946 he returned to his economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Hubblen-Norman... while studying at BSC, MA and PhD".
This comes from Woodruff's comment by the author at Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at Nottingham University, and at that time he completed his dissertation work on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and then published it in 1958 as a publication by the British rubber industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Hublon-Norman and summer 1952 at Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953, he definitely left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff went through this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina "Flamenco and Life" because its documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
They bound me with a simple and powerful charge, with which the viewers are exposed, and a kindness and respect for the photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of affection.
Resino can capture magical moments."
The Honda will strike again with their best seller
In November, Honda will start selling the second generation Jazz model.
If the predecessor of this one-space vehicle already had a significant space, it now offers even more spacious interiors.
This is accompanied by improved engines that increase the comfort of driving and enable more fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes on this one-space vehicle.
For example, innovative design, new platform, bigger dimensions and new engines should be mentioned.
Even before we examine the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz is coming to market six years after the introduction of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing that we will notice is that Honda needed a shorter period to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is a less famous model in Europe, in other markets it has become a phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
Almost a million pieces have been sold in Japan since Honda Jazz was placed on the market.
The second market became an old continent with approximately half a million sold pieces in six years.
Honda, however, aims to increase the sale of new Jazz in its category.
Meanwhile, in 2007, the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 pieces of Honda Jazz, an estimated 100,000 cars in 2009, which would mean an increase of 17% in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, Spanish branch management expects to sell 2,000 pieces for a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will enable Honda to significantly ease the decline in sales in Spain.
Driving a car thus de facto expects to end the year with a total of 22,000 sold pieces, which means 4,000 less than in 2007 and a decrease of 16 %.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share in the Spanish market to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company expects it to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-pronged compact hybrid with a length of 4.37 metres, from which the Japanese company promises worldwide sales of approximately 200,000 pieces per year.
As regards markets, Japan estimates that 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentages will be distributed by the old continent and Japan.
The launch of the sale of Honda Insight is expected in the first months of next year as soon as the public will be represented in Valencia in January.
In contrast to the first generation, the new Jazz has increased all dimensions.
Its length has increased to 3.9 meters (by 5 centimeters higher), width to 1.69 meters (by 2 centimeters higher) and axle dispersion to 2.5 meters, which means a five-centimeter extension.
On the contrary, the height has not changed and still stands at 1.52 meters.
Increases in dimensions have also increased internal space.
This advantage was achieved, however, by using a new platform, but by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used for the previous Honda Jazz.
Also the volume of luggage space - which has a double bottom system - increased to 399 liters, by 19 liters more than it did the volume of luggage space in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in version with engine 1.4 because the volume of luggage space at Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Another improvement besides external elements - such as rear LED lights or the possibility of fitting a glass panoramic roof - is easier access to rear seats.
Doors leading to the second row of seats allow the opening angle of 80 degrees compared to 67 on the first model of Jazz.
The second generation of Honda Jazz has new engines.
From the beginning this small model will be offered with two 1.2 and 1.4 liters petrol engines.
Both engines use the i-VTEC technology, which allows lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and provides excellent improvements to the propulsion system at the same time as the high torque in the full range of engine speeds.
The first 1.2 litre engine has a power of 90 horses at 6,000 speeds with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 turns.
This engine - which in the previous generation of Jazz 78 horses - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
In contrast to the previous engine, which reached 83 horses in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"Car bee" prevents collisions
To progress in the development of technologies that protect against accidents, Nissan was inspired this time in nature, specifically by bees.
This Japanese company created a robot that takes the role of flying bees and thus prevents collisions.
This is Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in prevention technologies.
Engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Centre for Technical Progress developed a robot in cooperation with the Center for Progress in Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doie, the general director of public relations for technology, research and brand development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the four areas of the Nissan security shield.
The task of the robot is to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions in cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the Nissan security shield.
The most important, however, are complex bee eyes that are able to see in all directions more than 300 degrees, allowing bees to fly in their personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual function, engineers proposed what they called laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It records the obstacles that are located up to two metres in a 180-degree radius before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends the signal to the on-board microprocessor, which will immediately transfer it to a collision warning.
"The moment the obstacle is recorded, the robot will copy the bee moves and immediately change direction by turning the wheels to the right or even greater angle to prevent collisions.
The biggest difference compared to any existing system is that all evasive maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If that were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
In contrast to bees, the robot cannot move up and down or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and the direction to which it is allowed by turning its wheels, but not in infinite quantities of directions and possibilities as for bees.
In addition to speeding and slowing down, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent the robot from crashing.
"The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and, according to these data, to be maintained.
It does not require any storage of information or logical intuition from previous manoeuvres, which may allow it to operate without interruption with just two dozen kBs of memory.
It may surprise you, but we don't talk about giga or mega in memory."
This is the first step in developing new technologies for immediate collision prevention, the technology for which Nissan predicts the use of serial vehicles for ten years.
Robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to build a unit in the GPS satellite navigation system that would lead the driver to the target and avoid obstacles on the road.
Enjoy the fear before you take a mortgage
It should be recognised that the US Treasury, in addition to having enough capital for injections, does not even lack ingenuity.
They appear in the face of a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages at banks with questionable solvency, they created a popular-science game on the Internet "Bad Credit Hotel".
Or "Bad Loans Hotel"... or a mixed hotel.
The hotel and especially its receptionist look grim to consider once, twice and three times whether the right time is to ask for credit.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not too detailed.
It is a page suitable for young people rather than for the whole public.
And what happens when the game is over?
A room of dreams will appear inside the hotel.
At least something, because I'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens his MIFG capital
Morgan Stanley's bank house reported that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, would spend nine billion dollars to get 21% of its capital.
The week after they discovered their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that the MIFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's current shares at a unit cost of $25.25, representing a total turnover of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the accounting value of the securities by 31 August.
MUFG invests another six billion dollars to obtain convertible securities that will provide it with 10% of the yield and the exchange price of which is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the entire operation would take place on the basis of an average unit price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% under its current course.
Morgan Stanley's shares still lost 6.79% and got to $23.07 around 5:00 greenwich time.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity on the way to speed up Morgan Stanley's transition to the banking holding statute," explained John Mack, CEO of this American group.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which will allow him to dissipate his activities, but it also puts him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with the MIFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest Ace on Wall Street to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The conditions presented on Monday, among other things, show that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"Just a week ago we thought," explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, "that our participation will consist solely of ordinary shares.
However, given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and also to cover ourselves."
On the basis of a weighted average price, MUFG will pay Morgan Stanley for securities by 7 % less than their accounting value.
The operation will result in a reduction in the share profit by about 20%.
The agreement assumes that in a year, MIFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares, if the last names are to be exchanged at a price of 50% exceeding the exchange price, i.e. around $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that the MIFG will bring will enable him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, the speaking group refused to provide any precise information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After an investment by MIFG, Morgan Stanley should boast the ratio of payment eligibility of Tier One to about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan pointed out that since the end of August, he has reduced his balance sheet emotionally.
The last weeks have been difficult for the group, as its stock exchange rate has fallen by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of default associated with debt have increased sharply.
These costs took on Monday the opposite trend, but remained high, around 12 %.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other survivor of Wall Street's large investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers broke down and bought Merrill Lynch that she picked $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Re-establishing the Republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third appointee put forward a motion for a new Constitution to vote, following the example of his counterparts and friends.
And his mission is accomplished, because 64% of the voters, according to official results covering 80% of the votes, voted in the 'yes' referendum.
"No" according to these results was 28 %, 7 % of the votes were invalid and 0,7 % of the ballots were empty.
In order for the Constitution to be adopted, he had to get half the votes plus one.
Two surveys carried out in the east of the polling rooms and the calculation of the NGO predicted a clear victory "yes" on Sunday, with 63% to 70% of them.
Rafael Correa, last night from Sunday to Monday, demanded the victory of his proposal for the Constitution.
"The Constitution won the entire line," he assured and congratulated Ecuadorians at the headquarters of Guayaquil Governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
He understands himself that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the observation mission of the Organization of the States of America (OEA), took place peacefully, covered the text on the 444-point "new socialism" promoted by the President.
The proposal of the Constitution devotes power to the state over the economy by guaranteeing it 'planning the development' of countries living primarily on oil production by foreign companies and foreign foreign companies which send their emigrants.
The proposal protected by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the Head of State who will be able to carry out two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that it will exercise this power and will apply for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution, inter alia, lays down the principle of free health and education, which the president began to introduce in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50 % of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it is also a ban on foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of Ecuadorian base as the starting point of American drug operations.
19 hostages were released in Chad
The Egyptian command took the kidnapping of eleven tourists and their eight-member escort, who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who had been held captive in the desert for ten days, were transported to the capital of Egypt on Monday.
During the morning, an Egyptian command was freed in Chad.
The hostages arrived around 15.30, apparently in good form, on board a special aircraft at the al-Maz military base, close to the international airport in Cairo.
Immediately they were transferred without the opportunity to express themselves in the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, the district residence district of Cairo, to be subject to medical examinations.
"They are totally healthy" and "no ransom paid to the kidnappers", the Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zohajr Garran announced on the airport's train path.
Since its capture on September 19, during a safari in a vehicle driven by all four wheels at the foot of Mount Uanat, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one shelter to the other 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two tour guides, four drivers, one border manager of the Aegiptous Agency, safari organizer.
A leader of the Egyptian security forces indicated that 30 members of the special forces who had approached the place on board two helicopters had taken off during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shootout, half the kidnappers were killed and the others escaped," said this source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the flash unit were sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini, from Belgrade right now, mentioned the role played by secret agents and components of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognise that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the people of our secret services, from the special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also denied that the ransom would be paid.
On the eve of the evening, the Sudanese army declared that it had detained a vehicle with the drive of all four wheels on which the kidnappers were on board, killing six of them, including the Chadian commander and arresting two of them.
The army claimed that they were connected to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Movement for the Liberation of Sudan - Unit (SLA-U), which immediately rejected the movement.
Letters - Quiet majority of the department of culture
The debate on the financing of culture fills the news pages with thumb titles and is the topic of the election campaign.
That's better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still being neglected.
Who will rise up to launder the poor sums that are provided by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national memorial sites that are starving?
Which politicians dare remind the federal government that they will ignore their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Québek, just like in Canada, we don't have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Valley of Loira?
For our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans, and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organisations, in cooperation.
In Québek, a federation of Québek’s history companies, at least 40,000 volunteers are working together to 211 companies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy on the expansion of history, the preservation of a collection of private archives and the protection of archeological remains for a few minor purposes.
Often these companies are the watchdogs of our monuments, which drive hopelessly protest when promoters and leaders release their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteryes.
When will we finally meet the bleachers for history and memory?
Government of Benelux national part of Fortis bank
The states of Benelux will help the Belgian-Holdanian Fortis Bank, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble because of the growing impact of the US mortgage market crisis, with a partial impact: three countries will support the monetary and insurance institutions, which also have a capital participation in Hungary, amounting to EUR 11.2 billion.
At the highest level, the Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch governments agreed on this weekend with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first in the euro area to have reached a major crisis in the context of the crisis of international financial markets, which has been spreading in waves for more than a year, and the decisions made in this matter could be seen as precedents in some respects.
In the sense of the decision that was made Sunday night, all three states will buy almost half (49 percent) of the bank’s assets.
The bank will sell part of its capital participation with absolute certainty, especially - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis bank shares began to decline sharply last week, with serious signs of crisis already appearing in the Constitution in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that with their 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to be let go.
The company's securities fell by only 12 percent on Friday, to 14-year minimum.
Since January, the stock value has fallen by more than two-thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the overall market value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but this is not realistic according to the company’s leaders.
The management of the company is also to blame for the collapse of Fortis stock in the overseas market of uncertainty related to the adoption of a $700 billion US package plan.
On Monday, the stock went up slightly.
On Friday, the new director general Filip Dierckx was appointed to head the bank.
The monetary institution was also looking for a private buyer, but with a more serious offer no one has yet applied.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors do not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
There was no panic among the bank's clients, and the branches were not under attack.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also bought several leasing companies.
The fox in the henhouse
Life and health insurance companies in America often reject the possibility of entering into an insurance contract with the applicant on the basis of data on the purchase of medicines.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme that weighs the use of prescription data in any case for the consent of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the henhouse to the fox," quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, author of a program designed to monitor prescriptions.
Insurance companies shall make insurance and the amounts paid in the event of insurance events dependent on the health status of the beneficiaries and, if the risk is considered to be too large, the insurance shall not include any insurance with it.
They had previously sent the medical examinations concerned and only concluded the contract when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick came up with a much cheaper procedure: on the basis of the number of drug customers, it is easy to find out what drugs he has bought in the last year and a half, from which the program itself produces, how he suffers from the disease and what his condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys a large number of cholesterol - lowering drugs, it refers to that he has practically uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately puts him in a higher-risk category.
There are several versions of the programme in circulation, some at the same time identify the risk ratio, so there is almost no work left in the insurance industry besides paperwork, although there are minor difficulties.
The disadvantages include that lecter medicines can be used for several purposes, some compounds are, for example, used against migraines or heat waves, but are also effective against depression.
These represent a significant risk-enhancing factor for commercial insurance companies, where the first difficulties were not identified.
For the purpose of requiring and processing data, special companies have been set up to ask the patient for permission before providing the necessary information from the physicians.
To that end, the authorities have now been forced to do so, even though they have not been punished for their past negligence.
Some companies have recently processed the results of laboratory tests that combine with the data on medication used, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the patient’s condition.
More and more companies have access to the data, while checking their use will be more and more complicated.
There is a specific health data protection law, but its effectiveness applies only to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
The draft law, which gives the authorities the power to control the data-providing companies, is before Congress.
Richard Dick admits that this is not enough: he has therefore developed his programme in such a way that data transmission is linked to the express consent of the person concerned.
The other thing is that the permission in question can hardly be denied, otherwise insurance companies will not enter into a contract with it.
So the chickens are a little bit given a good will to the fox.
Global Marseille Menu
The European Union and India double trade turnover
Since the European Union and India are mutual leading business partners, this topic was also led by other, mostly global problems and also by the agenda for the ninth summit.
The French-Indian Summit, which will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy, will also take place today.
The European Union recognises that India is a growing democratic power that should be given a greater opportunity to speak on international matters, but the Member States have not yet been able to find a common denominator in support of the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not even further discussed at yesterday’s ninth summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as current President of the Union, as well as President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who also agreed to double trade within five years, or to increase to more than 100 billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, it is not an overly ambitious objective.
Twenty-six already existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been reconciled legally in order to bring green air transport into the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that the negotiations would be accelerated.
The goal is to balance the balance while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi stands among EU partners in the ninth place.
The summit also paid attention to the global issue.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with respect to terrorism - both parties in all its forms have condemned and called for an urgent call to the UN conference.
They also organised the end of the Doha trade round, although they both had a large share in its previous failure.
The European Union has confirmed that it will continue on its energy and climate programme, as it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed with this, as well as the fact that the next year's climate conference would need to conclude a global agreement and produce greenhouse gases to reduce by 50 per cent by 2050.
Both parties would also like to prevent food price increases and support the convening of an international conference to address the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister now travels to the French capital, where, during a bilateral meeting, he plans to close trade on peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
Paris believes that the commission to build Indian nuclear reactors worth 20 billion euros will be obtained by French companies.
According to the Agency's reports, the agreement should be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
High participation of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will participate in the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from a hundred different countries to take 171,790 square metres of trade fairs with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to be seen, with Turkey as an honorary guest.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony in the Italian pavilion: Italy will, in fact, participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – 264 square metres of exhibition area.
It will be followed by a press meeting in Room Structure Buchmesse in pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the status of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors' books in relation to the total Italian production continues to decline, especially in view of the literature for children and adults.
Found an airplane by Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossetta's plane was found, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying through the desert in Nevada.
Trolls were discovered at one mountain level at an altitude of three thousand meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area in Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
But inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, raised doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we have confidence that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff thus stated that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
A 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The US Agency for Transport Safety (Ntsb) announced that several hours after the crash identification was sent to the investigation team, which finally identified the plane: it is precisely Bellanc 8kcab, missing since 3 September 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal items were found in one pair near their dwellings in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and one jacket.
Fossetta's search was interrupted a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire gained a place in history thanks to a long collection of championships.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete his journey around the world in an air balloon: two weeks of lonely flight.
Three years later, the world flew on a plane without landing.
Among his many records are also flights of 15,445 feet [15,445 m] above the Andes, though with the copilot.
Gluck, a commercial you don't expect.
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined determined lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last Glk born from the "compact" jeeps of the house of the star, by which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring the faith of the news into this sector.
Its unconventional processing will result in unexpected and unconventional communication that will accompany the introduction of Suv Glk on the market and will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showsrooms from the next 17 October.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the debut of the new vehicle, will launch an informal communication method also thanks to the futuristic 3D poster campaign, which is used for the first time in Italy for a car brand.
The Maxi poster project, divided into three different stages, will dominate the main Milan trading class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication begins by introducing a car in stereoscopic vision and using special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, you will be able to see a new Suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will have the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative technology Ellumina8, the new Glk will be illuminated in different moments in all its tinyness to recommence in a single picture.
The Mercedes is no doubt trying to introduce something new into the stereotyped field of car communication by using this ad.
Will he be able to arouse the interest of future customers in this way?
Well, we already know who the Italian hoodlums are.
Trivenett, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls for whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following Nazionale azzurra for years, and which, in truth, has never done too many problems.
She's never even met a rival fan.
The group's orientation is right.
Founders come from Trivenet.
From Verona, from Padua, from Terstue Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact, few groups) joined them from Campania and Puglie.
They have three coloured flags on which the cities of origin appear: on Saturday evening they were removed so as not to be recognized.
They're inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, true Nazi fans, Levsky, were found.
Figc made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match: all in name, i.e. easily controlled.
And Viminale really checked them all: among those who went to Sofia there was no one with the Dassl running, no one who would be forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previously committed stadium offenses were denied a ticket and no match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports that will come from the Bulgarian police, then he will take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to the fans who were arrested or those who were identified during the riot.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer enter a single stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is fear of emulsion: that means that more than one hundred and fifty are added.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not justify those who act this way," confirms Viminal.
So, "eyes open all the time, mainly for a national Wednesday game in Leč."
There's a small support core in Puglia right now.
Tomorrow, Osservatorio, on Tuesday, Casms, which can count on one part of Aise, is a secret service that deals with problems at the stadiums.
"Court leader-leader and tight arms during the Mamelah anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a very sad way) who is the director of the Viminál Osservatoria for a few weeks (he acquired a place that was formerly Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferliszi).
Mazzilli was formerly a quaestor in Terst, where he found the nucleus of Ultras Italia's supporters, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate a leader, but, of course, that the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist - adds Osservatorian One – crimes are attributed to the country in which they have become.
So far, this group has stayed within limits, and now we're going to take a good look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about whistles at Mamelah's anthem: it's not a crime either, but if you will, it's insubordination..."
