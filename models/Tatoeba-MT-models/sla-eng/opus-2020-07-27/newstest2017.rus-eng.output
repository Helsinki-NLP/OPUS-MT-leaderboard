28-year-old cook found dead in a shopping mall in San Francisco
A 28-year-old cook who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping centre this week.

"We are a small team that works as a friendly family and will miss him very much," said the representative.
Our thoughts and condolences to the family and friends of Frank during this difficult time.
Luis Galicia said that Frank stopped at the hostels at first, but lately, "He's been in trouble for a while."
"He found an apartment, he met a girl," Luis Galicia said to KGO.
Luis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a big heart.
His way of connecting with the family has always been to cook us some food, make us dinner," said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any fight.
He was a brother who swam through the stream.
"With all the bad things that are happening to this world, he was the limitless diamond that glowed brightly every day," he said.

Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
The International Group of Biologists concluded that the longest living vertebrate animal is the Greenlandic polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, which transmits RT.
Scientists carried out a radiocarbon analysis of 28 Greenland sharks' eye crystals.
The largest shark with a length of more than five metres may be between 272 and 512 years old.
Biologists believe that low metabolism, which leads to slow development, plays an important role in the longevity of the shark.
Female Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity only by 150 years.
Previously, it was thought that longer than any vertebrate animal, the shark's neighbor, the Greenland whale, lived next door.
The oldest person known to scientists was just over 210 years old.

Should you go to a sanatorium if there is no health problem?
Our expert is Chief Sanator of Olga Bogusz Sanatorium.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of his job, should he go to a sanatorium?
Sanitation and recreation are needed not only for treatment but also for the prevention of diseases.
In sanatorium, a person can check the condition of his body and receive advice from a doctor as to how he should live so that his health is not destroyed.
Such recommendations would not be unnecessary to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal from the body, it shouldn't be pushed away.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue.
And stress is experienced by about 90% of the arrivals.
He is most vulnerable to large cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it is best not to make things difficult and get some rest in time.
Studies have shown that 98 per cent of people are lowering their biological age while they are in sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfortable family rest.
So if you want to spend your vacation with your kids, you don't have to break up with them.
For children, even the smallest, there are health programmes that include both diagnostic services, paediatric counselling, analysis and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children ' s pools), inhalation, special diet, massage, oxygen cocktails, healing physical culture.
The course of procedures determines the physician, taking into account the individual testimony and characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, the sanatoriums usually have an animated children ' s club where children can attend play sessions, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for infants, provide nursing facilities and provide experienced nanny services.
A mild winter, a long summer, a lot of sunny days per year (over 300) create good conditions for a round-the-clock vacation in the Caucasus Mineral Water resorts.
And then the rest is not just for summertime.
So there is no need to be afraid of the weather behind the window, especially since most of the procedures are in the room and do not depend on the season.
It is desirable to conduct general sanatorium treatment twice a year, especially for adults.
Main fiche of the Caucasus Mineral Waters region, of course, healing mineral sources: Slavjanovski, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their water has unique properties and influences the various systems of the body.
Water varies by temperature, salt, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
Doctor picks water depending on the patient's self-esteem.
Thus, Narzan has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating effect, restores the function of the gastric- noxial tract and the exchange of substances.
Essentuki-4 affects the gastric and acetic tract, lowers the sugar level.
The Essentuki new has anti-inflammatory, biliary and urinary effects.
The water of Slavyanov is also affected by the same effects.
In the appointment of water, the physician must take into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks up less salt water because the salts hold the liquid, which leads to an increase in pressure.
The intake of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be consumed at a certain time, at the appropriate amount and at a specific temperature.
Various cosmetological procedures for the person and body are now available in sanatoriums.
What kinds of healings based on the natural features of the North Caucasus can be obtained in the resorts of the region?
In the vicinity of Pythagoras, for example, there is a salt lake called Tambucan, which is used for soils, vertebrates, and internal organs.
It provides anti-inflammatory, dissipating, immunomodulating action.
These are health-friendly walks along individually designed routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort (second in size in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is close to Narzan's mineral source.
There you can also take the baths with wine, pearly, yoccoury, selenium, scallops, depending on your appointment as a doctor.
Let's extend the fertility.
What can we do to keep the harvest going until the end of the season?
As told by Julia Belopukhov, an agronomist, and a Dutch woman.
It is high time for the tomatoes to make a strip, to remove new pastures, to cut the pox, to remove all the leaves, to remove all the leaves, with fruit, and to blossom with small bandages, they will not be able to mature.
All tomatoes, regardless of “constitution”, as well as peppers and baklagans, are fed with a saline-superphosphate strain, treated with bio-preparate (The ripper is used to accelerate the flow and growth of fruits, Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, Bactofit, Immunocytophitis - to increase immunity, Bitoxybacterin, Lepidocide, Fitzoverm - if there are pests).
Only copper cabbage, colloidal cheese and green soap should be used from chemicals at the end of the summer.
We're doing the last flood of plants.
Long-plated cucumbers in the heat add from the wallpaper so that the lower, shaved part of the stalk (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, watered with warm water and the solution of the zircon, and put down the 5-7 cm compost stem.
It is also not difficult to prolong the fetal state of the bulwark: cut the old leaves, pour warm water and a solution to the complex fertilizer, and sprinkle the fertile soil under the bush.
In order to protect from the night chills, set over the folding of the arc with the hidden material.
Keep your plants open during the day, and close them after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s withdrawal from the most prolonged recession in the last twenty years.
According to Bloomberg analysts, GDP shows a positive trend, with GDP dropping by 0.8 per cent in the second quarter of GDP in annual terms.
This figure has been the minimum since the beginning of 2015.
According to Rosstat, the decline in the Russian economy in the second quarter has slowed to 0.6 per cent.
The stabilization of the situation has recently also been announced by the Centre Bank and Mine Economic Development.
In advance, it's slow growth.
According to CBD experts, the recession in the Russian economy has remained in the past.
“Indicative assessment of Russian GDP indicates that the recession remained behind and ahead of the economy is slow growth”, says the Russian Bank's bulletin “What Trends Say”.
The module GDP estimates for the current quarter of the regulators increased to 0.4 per cent, with an estimated 0.5 per cent for the fourth quarter.
According to the representative of Mine Economic Development, during the second quarter, the decline in GDP in the second quarter was 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleared decline in GDP amounted to 0.2 per cent in the previous quarter.
But during the quarter the decline was halted: in April it was 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was between 0 and 0.15", says the representative of MER RIA "News".
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the last five quarters indicates that “the bottom has been passed”.
Among other markers showing signs of national economic recovery, Bloomberg calls the increase in electricity demand and rail transport, the revival of business.
If an adjustment is made to the fact that the year is high, it is understandable that the momentum in plus 1% of electricity consumption may be due to an additional working day.
Add a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the increase in freight transport, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data here, and plus-minus 0.5 per cent of the half-year volume can also be explained by seasonality," explains Cyril Jakovenko of ALOR BROKER.
In fact, there are other more obvious signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, a decrease in price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month last year.
Moreover, for the last two weeks, Rosstat has fixed deflation.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
Looking at the dynamics in the course of the ruble, which, while showing strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, increased by 12 per cent since the beginning of August.
It is also one of the signs of recovery, which must be followed by indicators from the real economy," stressed Jakovenko.
In addition, industrial production has increased since April.
The figure rose by 1.7 per cent in June.
The rate of trade falling from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May is slowed.
A positive trend is also evident in the labour market, where unemployment has fallen to 5.4 per cent.
It was below in September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the well-being of the labour market, the question of the actual available incomes of the population should be left to the best.
In annual terms, the figure decreases by 4.8 per cent.
This factor may hamper economic recovery, as household expenditures make a significant contribution to GDP.
Generally, the economic structure exceeds 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, strong policies by the Bank of Russia can also be described as a risk to economic growth.
The controller holds the rate at 10.5%, which is not the best impact on the real sector.
A negative factor is also a lack of high level of investment, which hampers the development of industrial capacity.
But in general, it can be expected that by the end of the year, the decline in the RF economy will be slowed to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015", says analyst GC Forex Club Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football, has been well enjoyed in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics until they are so actively developed in summer sports.
If the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and the former foreigners are speaking, it is in most cases the birthrights of the former Soviet republics.
In Rio de Janeiro, however, we can observe the reverse process, a large enough number of Russian flag States.
In each case, the history of change of nationality differs.
Some parents were taken to another country when they were young, leaving no choice.
Someone didn't stand up for a seat in the Russian assembly.
And someone thought that the best conditions for development in sports would be created abroad.
Aif.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian nationality.
A 27-year-old girl's German passport says her name is Lisa Ryzhich.
But before that, of course, she was Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years later, as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
That's where she decided to follow her older sister's footsteps - to take up athletics.
Like the sister, Lisa chose to jump with a six.
She's staying in Russia, and I don't think she'd be able to push Elena Isinbaev off the throne.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics, Rio Lisa will be the only one of our countrymen, though former, in the six-stairs sector.
Its best achievements in this form are the 2010 Europe Championship Bronze and continental silver in 2016, which it won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
The 29-year-old Elena Pirozkova was born in Novokusnetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandists in the evangelist direction.
Because of their faith, they went to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, eight other children grew in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena started a fight at school.
With good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where another former Russian citizen, Vladislav Izbojnikov, continued her training at the U.S. Training Centre.
At the 2012 Olympics, Elena lost in her first fight in London.
But the world championship of the same year is victory.
Prior to that, she was able to win silver at the world championship of 2010.
Then came the 2013 bronze and the 2014 silver.
26-year-old Mary was born in the town of Jaroslavla, where she was first introduced to synchronic swimming.
But to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
Maria continued her studies there.
Soon, she was in the U.S. assembly and showed excellent results at the Pan American Games.
It is understandable that, at a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America, its performance is ceilings.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, was given to Christine Shaldibin at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue teaching the girl art gymnastics around the ocean.
Until now, the girl had been involved in a favorite sport in her native Jaroslavla.
When she emigrated to the United States, she quickly joined the country’s youth assembly and later joined the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
In her first position on the world stage, of course, she did not have to fight, but for the United States, she organized a real breakthrough -- she brought out the Olympics Olympics star band in Rio.
Another former artist of ours is Jan Berezko-Marggrader, who is in favour of German assembly.
She was born in Toliatta.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl was more likely to enter the national assembly.
It soon represented its country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, indeed, she was only able to take 17 seats, which were not enough to enter the finals in personal competitions.
Two years earlier, however, she was able to win the Olympic Youth Bronze Medal.
Another gymnast, just this once, is Irina Sazonova.
If the ways of emigration of the former athletes can be called standard, the choice of the Irina family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a teacher of the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, she became the country's champion in Iceland.
True, Ira is still training in Russia - she comes to her homeland to avoid losing her skill.
In Rio, she did not do as well as she would have liked.
The best place is 40 in a personal fight.
There is very little information about the floater Maria Ugolkova in Russian information space.
Maria has been living and training in Switzerland for a very long time.
However, for a long time it has been under Russian flag, showing good results - even the country's 200-meter butterflies record.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and became a red-and-white flag.
In Rio, her best speech is 14th place in the 4×100 complex stage.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfanging project that allowed her to collect about 6,000 francs to pay for her preparations for the Olympics.
Adam Batirov, a 31-year-old freestyle fighter, spent almost all his career under the Russian flag.
During this time, Hasavurt's birthday boy managed to become the threefold champion of Europe, the Russian champion, the Russian International Sports Master.
When he stopped joining our national assembly, it was time to consider a change of nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from sports bridges.
The triumphant return took place at the Asian Championship of 2016 - Batirov was already represented by Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and received a trip to the Olympics in Rio.
Another ex - Russian, Mikhail Kudinova, is even less familiar in the home than the Swiss floater Maria Ugolkov.
The point is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
That's where Michael started doing sports gymnastics.
He has not made much progress at the international level.
In Rio, his top score was 40 in parallel brushes.
But for New Zealand, even the Olympic Games in gymnastics are already a breakthrough.
When Nast, born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her training in simultaneous navigation, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championship in Berlin, the girl took her sixth place in synchronous navigation.
In a duet with Eugenia, Tetelbaum Anastasia took eighth place.
She was in the salt program fifth.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitri Croiter is in favour of an assembly of Israel.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitri became the country's champion.
That same year he won the youth championship of the world.
A year later, Croiter also wins the gold of the Olympic Youth Games in Singapore.
In addition to the high jumps, Dmitri has a long and triple jump.
Albert, a 31-year-old, is another borner of Hasawurt, who, after long speeches for Russia, decided to change her sporting citizenship.
Unlike Batirov, however, Albert chose Romania, which he would represent in Rio.
In Russia, he was in favour of the School of Higher Sports at Krasnoyarska, and in 2011 he even became a national champion.
A 28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of a USSR volleyball player Jaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before his son Jaroslav was born, he was recognized as the world’s best volleyball player.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
The same family stayed for permanent residence.
In 2015, he became the bronze arm of the European championship held on the territory of his new homeland.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and joined his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, parents decided to emigrate.
Norway was originally the target, but it was not possible to reach the northern country - it had to go to France, in Nice.
There, Zelimhan continued to learn to fight freely.
He soon won the championship of peace among the juniors and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the sole representative of France in the tournament to fight.
And a free fight again, and a former Russian again.
This time, it will be about the North Ossetian son who emigrated to Spain, the Timeraz Friev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and is currently in favour of the national assembly team.
In fact, 30-year-old athlete has achieved high results in Russia as well.
It became the bronze arm of the 2007 and 2008 national championships.
The Charter of Non-Congregation has decided to change sports citizenship.
The last one on our list is the Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestana Mahakkale, Arthur Bijarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took his family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
That's where Arthur started boxing on the advice of his older brother.
Since then, Arthur has been the champion of Canada three times and has become the champion of the world among young people in 2012.
In 2015, Bijarslanov won the gold of Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Why do kids have to go to school?
According to Governor V. Kondratiev, "they must be raised not by actions and parades, but by systems."
They should grow up and understand from at least 7 years of age that they must be fairy tales and education.
But as long as this job seems formal, I suspect it's more on paper.
If the Cossacks take in all the positives that were accumulated earlier, at a qualitatively new level, I'll be glad.
If we're all in a hurry and we don't know how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
JCC continues to be one of the country's most criminal sectors.
There are attacks on funds allocated to the public sector from budgets at different levels.
According to the Hen procuratorate, excessive tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the area of JCC.
As a result, consumers in the region overcharged more than 170 million roubles.
The Prosecutor ' s Office and the Prosecutor ' s Office of the Krasnodar Region identified the facts of the inclusion in the tariffs of undue costs.
A 4 million rubles have been placed on RV consulting (on cold water) to rent cars at a price above the market.
And these are examples in the land of mass.
The people pay for the “communal” of the last money, with the correct payment, according to the Ministry of Finance, the average collection of payments from the population is 94 per cent.
He is accused of several articles of the Penal Code: Ratra, the legalization of proceeds obtained by criminal means, abuse of authority, etc.
According to the investigation, as head of the fund, which was responsible for repairing urban facilities, Makarov had concluded contracts with entrepreneurs and had not actually been executed but had been paid.
Businessmen were just giving him most of his money back.
As the head of the UK, Makar’s money was collected from the population, but he did not pay and spend it on his own needs.
As a result, the budget and the housing sector are damaged by millions of roubles.
Makarov's machination scheme, ear, typical of Russia.
There was a wave of arrests and detentions by the leaders of the Criminal Code, who donated money to citizens.
Kamchatka continues the trial of A. Kohan, by the same way as the former deputy of the mountaineer, who is accused of fraud by 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013 in Elizovo Kamchatsky, it established 6 company managers and established 3 limited liability societies.
One of them was contractual work for the Criminal Code, and two others played a role in the accounting and cassal centres, i.e. in accepting money from the population.
However, A. Lover’s energies were not numbered, but he was spending money on himself, a loved one.
It is quite difficult to judge in the area of JCC.
Cases don't get excited, they're stalling.
And “helps” in this very confused housing legislation, according to Svetlana Razlatnev, Executive Director of NP "JKH Control".
We have failed to earn one law, as we have come up with a new law that must make the previous one work.
There are also few specialists, including judges, on issues related to the JCC.
Lawyers themselves admit that housing law in universities is very limited.
The denial of criminal proceedings is also mentioned in the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Of the 3,500 crimes in the proceedings in 2015, less than half of them were committed to the courts.
The rest of the investigation had been delayed and each fifth had been suspended in connection with the failure to identify the accused.
The shortcomings of law enforcement are often reflected in the legislation in force.
There is a law, but the authorities do not rush to initiate and investigate such matters.
In the second half of 2015, about 230 reports of counterfeiting were launched, with only 60 criminal cases being initiated.
During the 5 months of the current year, only a small increase of 99 had been made.
What is the falsification of the housing record?
This means that the change in home management, financial and other issues are going beyond the opinion of the owners.
This also means that the housing and utility market cannot be breached by normal companies who want to work honestly rather than milk the population.
So it turns out the tenants are negative, the small and medium-sized businesses are also.
First of all, by eliminating corruption as such throughout the State, Anton Jarkov, a member of the State Property Committee, is confident.
This work is now being actively pursued.
It's not just single shares, it's a targeted course in combating corruption.
Not in all regions, of course, such a sad situation.
In particular, there is no scandal in the capital.
Why is there no such scandal in Moscow as in many other regions?
Because the capital government has shown iron will and order, said Anatoly Electoral, a member of the Committee of the Secretary-General for Security and Anti-Corruption.
I am referring to both the human resources issue and the legislative amendments and legal education.
The managers are closely supervised, and they have all been licensed.
Complaints by citizens are promptly resolved in public space (and the treatment of residents, and responses are posted on the Moscow Government Portal).
Many do not simply pay monthly bills, but watch carefully what is written as a home.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and obligations of resource providers and managers is very high.
Plus Moscow checks the validity of housing-communal tariffs, as a large part of the budget goes to subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
Perhaps all of this together explains the calm conditions in Moscow.
Does it look like everyone's in the will of the regional authorities?
Perhaps the unsuspecting should change the place of work?
A Turkish Gambit.
Can Erdogan abandon his friendship with the EU and the United States?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan nominated the U.S. Ultimatum, proposing to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup d'état.
He made this statement to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on the Americans to give up support to the "terrorist organization of Fethullahists".
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States calls for a change of heart.
Experts believe that Turkey ' s dissipation with the West is increasing and may lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
“Early or late America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO (“Terrorist Organization of Fethullahists”).
Either the organizing of the FETO coups or the democratic Turkey.
It must make this choice," the Anatolian Agency quoted Erdogan as saying Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again, but already more strongly demanded that the United States comply with his demand for the first time immediately after the rebellion was suppressed.
Let us recall that an attempt was made on the night of 16 July in Turkey by senior representatives of the Turkish army to overthrow the legitimate authority of the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of State.
However, after Recep Erdogan had addressed the population, the riot was suppressed and its organizers and participants were arrested.
About 8,000 people were suspected, with teachers and scientists in ranks other than the military.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gulen, who lived in Pennsylvania, U.S.A.
Erdogan's supporters also admitted that the coup d'états could be involved and directly American.
All claims were denied by refusing to issue Gulen and advising him to change the tone.
The last statement by the representatives of Goddep to that effect was made at the time of Erdogan ' s visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey - he insists on his own and also demands other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under the EU migration agreement if Brussels does not enter the date of lifting visa restrictions for Turkish citizens”, said Minister Omer Chelik of Turkey on 9 August.
He said that the amendment of Ankara's anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe's own security.
Note that on August 1st, German Vice Chancellor Zigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open borders for migrants in order to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words responded to the related statement made by the Turkish Chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Mevluta Chavushoglu.
Another provocative statement by Chavuchoglu made on the past Wednesday, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish MID did not rule out the possibility of leaving the alliance if he did not receive the support he was expected to receive.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence field is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries working with foreign States in the defence area, carrying missiles," Chavuchoglu said in an interview with Anadolu.
He said that Turkey now needed to establish its own defence system on the basis of its technology and to cooperate with other countries.
"Also far, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have begun to look for others," the Minister said.
Experts believe that all of this indicates Turkey's serious differences with the West and the country's re-orientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Experts, Evgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdogan is currently playing his game and cannot go into a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a very much to do with the West and in terms of business and in terms of military (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think that Erdogan will try to balance with the West by maintaining a framework.
While, of course, Americans would be more comfortable to see a fully obedient person in this post," the expert explained.
He said that after statements by the Turkish leader (not paying EU compensation, demanding a visa-free space with Europe and issuing Gulen from the United States) would put pressure on him.
“Rejep Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with America and the European Union, which will be pressured by humanitarian issues, dictatorial practices and so forth,” he said.
The head of the Political Information Centre, Alexi Muhin, allows the President of Turkey to change his views on relations with Russia as soon as he benefits.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took an extremely harsh position on Russia and in all ways sought favor in the West.
In a very short period of time, the situation changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that in time the President of Turkey does not once again change his priorities.
I think Erdogan entered the era of frontal diplomacy.
After being between the two poles, the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," Mohein said.
In his view, the main task for the President of Turkey today was to maintain political power in the country, and for that he needed Russia and partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which control the situation in Syria and the Middle East through it.
That is why consensus will be reached with Turkey," the expert said.
The head of the Asian and Middle East Centre, Anna Glasov, has a different view.
Turkey's relations with both the EU and the US are quite tense now, and this is primarily about the internal policy being pursued by Erdogan himself.
I believe that this crisis will be exacerbated, and in the face of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to re-load policies in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, are saying that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, to settle relations with Israel, to engage actively with Iran," explained Aif.ru Glazov, who said that the next step would be to normalize relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy now being pursued by Erdogan is a return to the course of foreign policy followed by Turkey before the beginning of the Arab revolutions.
"It was then that Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in positions of "no problem with its neighbours".
Very good visits by the President of Turkey to Russia and Africa have now been made.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey's positions in both the regional and international arenas," the expert said.
The Glasgow believes that Turkey's return to its former relations with the EU will be incredibly difficult, and now the question is whether the EU will start to respond severely to Turkey, which can open borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Junior Doctors Strike: Calls for New Collective Protests
Representatives of junior doctors requested the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The Committee of Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) intends to request its full advice to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC said the Ministers could not answer questions about the employment contract.
The younger medical doctors and students voted in July for the cancellation of the contract of employment agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday evening, JDC President Ellen McCort said that the Government had continued to "keep silent" about the problems it said had led to the rejection of the labour contract.
She said, “In taking into account the prevailing situation, the JDC leader voted in favour of rejecting the proposed new labour contract in full and calling for formal renegotiations on all your issues.”
In response to the Government ' s silence, the JDC leader made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council today to approve a continuous programme for the expansion of collective protests since early September.
The dispute led young doctors to participate in six strikes this year, including the first universal strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
BMA junior physicians leader, Dr. Joan Malwana, resigned after voting to abolish the agreed terms of the employment contract recommended by BMA.
He told the members of the BMA that the deal was a good one to be accepted during the meetings ahead of the vote of 54,000 medical assistants and students.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the labour contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "The Alliance of the Poor"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague at the gilded palace in St. Petersburg, I felt that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was a handshake, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile looked tight, and he hardly spoke out warmly even by his own restraint standards.
In contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his “good friend” Mr. Putin, five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis level but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm meant otherwise.
But the lingering cool of Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first cause of the crisis was what he mentioned in the introductory comments: Turkey has beaten down the Russian exterminator on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction was impersonal at this point.
Mr. Putin became angry with the tirade, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
The abuse was even more severe, based on the alleged friend.
Restoring real trust would be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the media controlled by the State carried out a stunning, complete attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed to the Turks to be guilty of everything.
The most serious allegations were that Mr. Erdogan's own family had been exploited by the illegal trade in oil from the Syrian areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it decisively.
But there was an official signal in St. Petersburg that the time had come to move on.
In the end, this meeting was only because Mr. Putin received the apology he had requested from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim to win some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get, after he was almost thrown off his post last month in an attempt to reverse it.
Re-terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him, too.
There is also economic reason.
The Russian sanctions have hit hard — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast annually.
The number fell sharply by almost 90%.
With regard to Russia, tour operators and charter companies are, of course, relieved when flights finally resume.
They're putting the end of the season on the Mediterranean.
Even this week, public television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," according to a report in the newspaper of the News.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is evil in the West for what it considers to be a weak response to an attempted coup.
Add to this her lingering frustration at the pace of talks about joining the EU and Mr. Putin’s move to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroy Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader has, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for the support of the elected authorities after an attempt at coup d'état.
Remember, this is a tribute to Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So, the summit at this brilliant seashore palace allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine that one analyst described me as the “bad alliance”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West unite forces.
Nevertheless, despite the public demonstration of reconciliation, the two still differ significantly.
Syria is key, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
Perhaps he himself says that after almost three hours of initial negotiations while the two presidents gave a press conference, they did not even touch on the topic.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the answer to the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find a common language for Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and taking into account the possibility of a complete disaster when a member of NATO Turkey knocked down a Russian jet fighter — it is certainly better that at least two leaders are talking again.
Royal Scottish Bank will disappear for clients outside Scotland
The brand RBS should be reduced to the role of the back office, according to the Bank's Executive Director.
The Royal Scottish Bank will disappear for clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told the Scottish BBC that the RBS brand was linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
The bank had withdrawn from them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During this period, brand strategies were used by RBS to protect other consumer credit brands.
He was supported by millions of pounds of funding for international sport, from the Cube of Six Nations Regby to the Champion of Wimbledon Andy Murray.
But it was now decided that it was right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Scottish Bank will be used with Scottish clients but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external central office and the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for private banking that will have more influence — Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave interviews during a tour of clients and staff in Invernessshire.
He said to the BBC of Scotland, "Brand RBS will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our staff will be employed, because we are now becoming more of a brand bank."
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying now that we don't have global aspirations anymore, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsoring support to the Six Nations Cup, and it is increasing the profile of the various brands in sponsoring sport.
"This is the right time for us to move the brand bank, because the base (we asked ourselves) is how we focus on improving the customer bank?" said the Executive Director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said that we were going to be a great customer bank and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we've been doing, focusing on customer needs, not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can get these brands back, so I think it's a good time.
Frankie Dettori wins 3,000 wins Newmart in Addiction.
The dettors spray champagne after a double in Newmarquet brings him to 3,000 wins.
The jockey, Frankie Dettori, won his 3,000th victory in Newmart on Friday.
He came to this remarkable mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track, Addiction, trained by John Godden.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this outstanding mark in smooth jumps.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Long Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Iddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion of Dettori's jockey, who had won the Ghayyar, said, "That's something special."
I'm very excited because my family's here too.
I'm very glad it happened in Newmarkt, because this is where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big secular event, it's not the Royal Ascot, it's just Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm off the case, and I'm very unattractive.
The detours applaud when it leads to predisposition after victory.
Two jockeys scored in the obstacle jumps: Richard Johnson's champion jockey and Sir Anthony McCoy's 20-time retired champion, who won over 4,300 careers.
Lester Piggott, Derby's nine-time winner, 4493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern age, and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark that so few have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but he's got a tactical thug that separates him from the others in the weight room.
He was a great representative for jumping, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fanatics to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom, he'd bring up 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey of weekends and big jumps!
And seriously, Frankie has been bringing the winners to Britain for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character, which is good for British jumps, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with a firm speed jump from the horse
From rapid finishes to speedy jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth jumps for two decades.
They were takeoffs and falls.
Many high jump winners, including his famous "Great Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the air crash and stayed in disqualification because of the doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge skeptics and return to form.
And he may not have finished for some time yet — Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue to participate in the competitions, at least until the age of 50.
Putin dismisses Sergey Ivanova's head of administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed his head of administration, Sergei Ivanova.
Ivanov was part of Putin’s trusted neighbor for many years.
This 63-year-old has now been appointed Environment and Transport Representative.
A statement from the Kremlin states that Putin "has ordered Ivanov to be released from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the President," but has not stated the reason.
Mr. Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vayno, was appointed successor.
Mr. Vaino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital city of Estonia, Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MIGMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he was head of the administration of the President's report and the Government's office, reporting on the Kremlin's website (in Russian).
During his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the Administration is to support your activities as Head of State in drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are being implemented.
Putin told a Russian television channel on Friday that Ivanov had requested his release and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Do smiles convince you?
It's a move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet Security Service, the KGB.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was shown on State television, both men stated that the Head of Administration had resigned on his own terms.
But despite the smiles on the camera, few have convinced — especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unforeseen consequences of some power struggle?
Until no one knows.
But the official statement — that the person for whom they once advocated as a potential president suddenly wanted to govern Russian environmental policy — was met with tremendous scepticism.
In Putin’s comments quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said: “It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to trust me with this very difficult position, even a challenging position, for four years.
Well, I guess I was the head of the President's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Previously, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, like Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov a five - man whom he trusted the most.
Once it was thought that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, because Putin's third term would be contrary to the constitution.
However, the post was held by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister until his return to the presidency just three and a half years later.
"Thinking Like a Criminal" star, Thomas Gibson was fired after a fight with a producer.
Gibson was involved in a shootout at a show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his removal was announced.
There were creative differences in surveys and differences of opinion.
I regret that this happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson's character will be removed from the show that monitors the FBI agents' team is expected to follow later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who had played the leading role in the Dharma and Greg sitcoms, had been on the show since the first season in 2005.
“I love to think like a criminal and put my heart and soul in it over the last twelve years,” Gibson said in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there for the rest of my life, but now it won't be possible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our amazing team, and, most importantly, the best fans the show could ever have dreamed of.
The show is scheduled to return with its twelfth season on 28 September.
Mystery: Fish land in Banfa Garden
A Banfa man sought help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bane believes that 75 fish could have been sands left by the water spruce.
Bane, who lives 500 metres from the sea, posted a survey of this sight in Periscope, hoping that someone could shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Quinsferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers connected the northern spring and viaduct of Queensferry Crossing, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four links between the canvas fan(s) that are now approaching the completion of the three sawn bridges.
The Fife Bridge Section now weighs 30,000 tons 600 metres in length.
In it, 10,000 tons became 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of bridge.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing engineering in a truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and have been used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the link between the viaduct and the bridge canvas is a virtual operation using extremely accurate assembly tolerances.
A total of about 79 per cent of the entire bridge canvas is now on site, and for the last section of the canvas, concrete coating is poured out in Rosate today, which means that all the canvas is ready to be lifted at the site of the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first connection on each bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this connection is the most modern building art.
After installing the last section of the road canvas and connecting it to the expanding North Pilone road canvas, we still had to close the remaining abyss on the north side — or on the bank — to the side.
This was done by pulling a north-east angle of 700 millimetres south.
It was a massive and yet very fine operation.
Large, because a 222-metre-long viaduct weighs about 6,000 tons and should have been raised to an angle of about 3 per cent.
Exquisite, because the team’s tolerances were tiny — just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, all of this went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men's lucky to stay alive
Three men were lucky to stay alive after being thrown off a fishing boat in England.
The Moelfra RNLI rescue station raised an alarm at 13:20 a.m. British summer time on Friday, after the team saw an incident unfolding in Moelfra Bay.
Three men tried hard to get to a safe place, while their ship continued to take its course.
"We saw their ship circle with them and assume the worst," said Moelfrey Vince Jones, a rescue boat driver.
“Unhappily, by the time we reached the water, a strong wind took him away from them,” he added.
Two men were rescued with the help of a local fishing vessel, and a third man for 60 years was found impoverished and stranded in a storm without a life jacket.
They were all picked up on board a coaster lifeboat and taken to a rescue station.
Jones said, "Three men thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely harmless.
The boat's engine had an emergency switch, but it sort of broke off from the man who was driving the boat when it crashed.
Someone's been guarding these guys today.
Pokémon Go, worth hunting for health and happiness
It's interesting to see the world change.
The fact that adolescents and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been a complaint of many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people away from the couch and engages them in some physical activity.
The time in the screen was originally limited by television, video games, and lately smartphones.
It is so great to see that technology and street activity are not mutually exclusive.
I am referring, of course, to Pokémon Go, an application based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (which subsequently produced a series of cartoons, playing cards and other responses).
Like many other pop-culture phenomena, all this was lost a little before this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launching in other countries at the time was delayed by a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In the days considered, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, the smartphone players are going to look for the Pokemons that are GPS-tracked, and when they're discovered, they can be 'photographed' (through a screen on your phone) or 'puyed'.
The generation that played the game as a younger generation joined in the pursuit of the wildebeests.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the “normal” person on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an application for Apple Watch, which monitors 35,000 users, recently reported to Washington Post that within two days of the start of the game, the number of people they monitored every day who performed 30 minutes of exercise jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go, it just sees primary data about passing levels.
Many health campaigns that convince people to “find 30 minutes”, “get out of the couch” and “be active every day” have not responded because most health messages are boring and express themselves to people who seem unhappy.
Nevertheless, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who practice regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to correct weight, high arterial pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that she drags people out into the street to do what they love.
Thus, three basic basics of health are: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends in hunting.
As usual, there are boring boredoms who are looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might come across the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
After all, despite the fact that smartphone applications such as Fitbit were able to track our physical activity before, they did not give us a reason for the exercise that this game gives us.
The news will come in, and the use will weaken over time.
But because of the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good form and in good health.

Simona Bailes wins the gold of an absolute virginity in female gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the commotion.
Simon Bailes is invulnerable for all of this.
It's dynamic on a support jump.
Unforced on a log.
Stunning on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now finally, the Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of the absolute champion on Thursday, putting the rest of the world in a convincing demonstration under the close attention of the Olympics.
Her total score of 62,198 was at a sufficient distance from the silver medalist and comrade of the Final Peterka team, Eli Reissman, and the Russian bronze medalist Alicia Mustafana.
Bailes from the United States is on a gymnastics log during the final of the women's individual absolute gymnastics championship of 2016 at the Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bailes became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the title of the champion of the absolute primacy and the fifth in general, consolidating her reputation as the best of her generation and, perhaps, whenever.
She was crying when she was shown her final general score and her long journey to that point was over.
This achievement puts it in the same league as very rare athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their sports to new heights:
Bailes has spent the last three years dominated by her sport, winning 15 medals of the world's champion, including 10 golds, with such stunning programs in their mix of hard work and accuracy that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her the "greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One final test was expected in Brazil, not so much between Bailes and the others in this area as between her and the burden of expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family's home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be seen as an unwarranted expectation.
Simon Bailes from the United States, on the left, and Eli Riceman are hugged after winning gold and silver in the finals of the women's individual absolute gymnastics championship at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, aug.
Bailes earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final according to the farewell party of the retired coordinator of the national assembly, Martha Karoli.
While Bailes insisted that she had never looked to the future during her long journey to the top, that is not the case.
Part of her free exercise program — which includes her firm passage — is set up for Latin American music, which would go straight as houses on the street right outside the Olympic Arena of Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandfather and grandmother, who were starting to walk and opened up to the mother of coach Amy Burman during a visit to the room where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She has not played a single match in absolute primacy since the summer of 2013 — a lane that should continue as long as Bailes will.
Although Mustafa had a little advantage with two turns, it was a mirage.
The gymnastics log and free exercise — where Bailes defends the title of the world champion — are ambushed.
She went forward again with 15.433 on the log and ended up with 15.933 on the floor.
Riesman gave her a soft hug while they were waiting for the final account — pure formality — and the tears appeared around the shiny red with the white and blue underwater eyes of Bailes when the idea she had once written in the scrapbook was made.
Reissman was small in revenge four years ago when she shared third place, but lost her Mustafa bronze on tai line.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team that Americans call "grandmother" was way ahead of us.
She sent a kiss to the crowd after her free exercise covered by the return, which sometimes seemed to be a question.
With regard to Bailes, a 19-year-old viral tweet from the beginning of this week now has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in the serial murder case were shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the murder of Phoenix' first serial killer in the last decade were sitting in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released on Thursday.
Angela Roschel Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and daughter Ellis, Malia, were shot on 12 June when their car was parked in the carriageway, authorities said.
The offender fired about eight shots from a gun standing on the passenger side of the vehicle, after which he hid on another vehicle, is reported in the report.
The police claim that the triple murder appears not to be the result of a robbery, since the perp did not take a wallet or $2,900 at the disposal of one of the adult victims.
A representative of Phoenix Police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting prompted investigators to see if he had been involved with the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others were injured as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American regions for four months.
“It’s happening in a residential area in front of the house,” said KPHO, CBS branch at the beginning of this month.
Suspected as being used by several vehicles, including brown Nissan in the late 1990s, black BMW in the late 1990s, and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and daughter Ellis, Malia, were killed on the scene.
The witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also issued a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup in half an hour before the triple murder and was believed to have been the case of a serial killer.
The investigators found the shells and pulled the bullet out of the seat and fragments of the bullet from the engine compartment.
The mother of a 6-year-old child with microcephaly: "Better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
Unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly as a result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Pixivto, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was — I couldn’t do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign for it.
Which, in fact, is not true — of course you sign it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized medical facility.
“My first answer was, ‘I didn’t think people do that anymore,’” explained Pixivto.
Edmund's walking.
Edmund did not sit and crawl until he was three, and he still does not speak.
But he's slowly going through some stages.
He walks with outside help and rides a bicycle.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture that Edmund made for "please sing to me."
“We’re learning his sign language, ” said Pixivto CBS News.
But not just the usual sign language, she says that Edmund has invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur due to a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zeke.
Symptoms and prognosis may differ significantly.
It's too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zeke virus.
Pixivto remembers emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
Did I always say what would happen?
What's gonna happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifetime forecast, because I don't expect anyone to really be able to tell me.
But Pixivto has encouraging advice for mothers with birth defects because of Zeke.
It's getting better.
You know everything's going to be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, floods are the cause of rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and the massive flood in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state before Saturday inclusive.
Many rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi have left the coast and threaten a massive flood after extreme rainfall, the National Meteorological Service reported.
Governor Louisiana John Bell Edwards stated that government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance had already gone to the affected revenues.
Mike Steele, representative of the Office of the Governor for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that requests were made for high water transport, boats and sandbags.
Steele said Tanjipacho's only income had invited tens of thousands of bags of sand.
The danger of flooding persists until Saturday in most of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3-5 inches might invade the area.
In southern Alabama, the duty to await the flood lasted until Friday, as the rain continued to flow to the Mobila area.
The Comet River near Baton Rouge and the Amit River near Dan Springs, both in Louisiana, was expected to set a record of flood levels in the last weekend.
Synoptic Alec Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flood coming down at the arrival of Assenchen was a threat, as these blowing rivers would slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of the state of Mississippi in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest registered level at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers were still extracting people from floods in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the south-west of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife, and her pasture were among the rescued early Friday morning near Glastre.
Hansford, 62, says that the waters of Beaver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his house, rose quickly in the night.
He said that another pasture that lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up, and the water kept coming," said Hansford.
It's reached my belt level.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest tributary she had seen in 48 years that she had lived here.
Hansford said that he and all his family had disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said the rescue workers rescued all three of them with the help of an army truck and delivered them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann says that the flood is “fastly spreading” as the rain continues, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann said that one observer near Livingston reported a crash of 13.75 inches [13.75 inches] of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the soil was overwrought by rainfalls from the environment.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets led to the rescue of residents from homes in Tanjipahoa and the abolition of the five school districts, authorities say.
WWL, the CBS branch, reports that Counsellor Tanjipahoa described 200 houses that had been flooded.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but they're both warming up right now.
Robbie Miller, Chairman of the Arrival, said that the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals in high water.
The shelters were opened in the city of Aimit and Hammond to accommodate those who had been evacuated.
"They will be able to return home as soon as the water begins to retreat," he said.
In the town of Hammond, Tanjipahoa's arrivals were closed for about two dozen streets because of high water levels, and sand bags were available for the residents in hopes that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
“The last major flood we had was in March,” said city manager Lacey Landrum.
It is on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison district, the head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey, reported that the siege rain had continued to flow off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Thompson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store at Amite, lives in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," said Tauson, "and it's still flying to the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, bullet-stricken, remains alive after a shootout in Philadelphia.
Police report that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a second shooting in a 6-year-old town this week.
His grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandma and Grandpa say Brown suffered numerous gunshot wounds, including his scent, leg, arm, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
“ He was hit hard, his little body was shot out, ” says his grandmother Delores Melendez at the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy lives in a hospital in critical condition and has survived several operations.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to be in first grade at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who had been shot in the Germantown area.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were reported to be in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car near a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could have been the shooter.
Investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a shootout between several armed men.
Semi-automatic weapons shells attributed to various copies of semi-automatic weapons have sealed the scene.
It seems that it was definitely a long battle.
There were shells on the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it seems that there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting, ” police captain Anthony Jinaldi reported.
Many homes and cars in this area have also been hit.
No arrests have been made, and the police are reportedly watching video cameras.
Another six-year-old girl was struck in the arm by a walking bullet Tuesday when she played in front of her home in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby and Lori?
That's what I call the women's gymnastics Olympic Assembly this year and for a few reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
Second, three gymnasts play a key role: Simon Bailes, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Hernandez, who have inspired so many white girls.
The composition of this assembly, supplemented by Eli Riceman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
It looks like America at last.
This has also strengthened the black and Latin American female presence at the top of this sport.
Over the past four years, female gymnast number one has been African American.
Last year, Simon and Gabby were Nos.1 and No.2.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed it.
The world could now be a witness to three-time World Champion Simon Bailes, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unexpected but yet virtuosic gymnastics.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth consecutive American to win gold in a female individual absolute primacy.
And Eli Reissman's teammate earned silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this kind of sport, but it doesn't look that way in gymnastics all over the country.
Simon, Gabby, and Lori have all taken the same path as Ali and Madison to form an Olympic assembly.
They're the final five, because the next Olympic gymnast will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year of coaching, Martha Karoli.
In fact, gymnastics is a costly sport, and gymnasts are first trained in private gymnastics clubs supported by parents who pay for the cost of training, equipment, travel, form, participation fees, hotel services (for trainers and their gymnasts and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnasts are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts receive everything from their training, and this is a costly and long-term responsibility for gymnastics families.
Amy Burman, coach Simone Bailes, and Maggie Hani, coach, Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they accepted gymnastics.
We must create more affordable and affordable gymnastics education for the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simon, Gabby and Lori.
I founded my gymnast fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and low-cost gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (mainly black and Latin American) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resilience to exhausting work, discipline and mental persistence.
This combination has a positive impact throughout life on good health, success in school and work.
It is the inspiration of this assembly that will send thousands of girls to practice gymnastics, and that is wonderful.
Sports is so important, especially for girls.
It's such a great time now.
Thank you, Simon, Eli, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Force in winning the Olympic gold team and for motivating so many girls of different origins to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors have taken the initiative to announce further strikes following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers hoped to conclude the alteration dispute by agreeing a modified treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the treaty, said that the NHS was on "no one's land" and any subsequent delay would damage staff and patients.
The first junior doctors were transferred to a new contract, which included night shifts and weekends to improve out-of-time services.
Dr. Ellen McCott, Chairman of the Committee of Young Doctors" BMA said last night in a statement: “The junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will underpin the existing labour crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly.”
Only eight weeks remain before the first group of doctors is transferred to a new contract, progress is needed and time is needed.
The WMA ' s attempt to resolve the dispute in the negotiations was met with the reluctance to act and sometimes with total silence from the Government.
And that despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, to inspire the introduction and to respond to the fears of younger doctors.
If he does not, then the younger doctors are sure that they are ready to conduct subsequent strikes.
The last strike in late April delayed some 13,000 scheduled operations and 100,000 receptions of nurses, while nurses and consultants were engaged to replace doctors on the picket line.
The Ministers hoped to end the change dispute by agreeing on a modified treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants to pay better weekends for 54,000 junior doctors who will fall under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS Employees, called on junior doctors not to continue the strikes.
Mortimer said: “The strikes reach little or nothing, but they put pressure on the teams and services that are already working on the ground, and cause anxiety, physical pain and frustration to patients, residents and their families.”
During the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Junior Doctors and, together with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
The workers hoped that continued positive support on other important topics — such as staff distribution, flexibility of training, additional training for returnees after a career break, cost of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay gap in medicine — was a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were to meet the conditions of WMA in November, February and May.
A £2 a day drug can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are going to use the drug for £2 a day after the authorities have recommended giving it to a greater number of people and for a longer time.
ticagrelor counter-reversal reduces the risk of relapses for people with heart disease.
The drug has already been prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The NICE National Health Service advised that it should be given to people for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE National Health Service has now advised that it should be given to people for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs with about 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them have another stroke or attack.
Cardiac attacks and strokes result from the accumulation of fat on the walls of the arteries and the formation of blisters.
If it breaks into pieces, it can cause a clot that blocks the access of blood to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it can travel through the bloodstream and block the bloodstream to the brain by causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
The ticagrelor produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and sold as Brilique reduces the risk by making the clots less likely.
The NICE draft instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Although there are effective secondary prevention methods with about a quarter of people who have had a heart attack, there will be another heart attack or stroke — often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor, combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By recommending ticagrelor, we are pleased to have the opportunity to increase the treatment options available to thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited after the expiry of three years, the draft instruction does not recommend longer treatment.
The PC's ownership culture promotes falsification of vote numbers in Muslim areas
Mr. Touer-Hamletsa Lutfur Rahman was suspended last year because of corruption, serving as a follow-up to the Government
The culture of political adjustment has led to blindness, which has resulted in widespread falsification of vote counts in Muslim communities, according to information from the devastating report of the government published today.
The former cabinet member, Sir Eric Pickles, has been criticized by the police, election observers and city administration for ignoring evidence of elections violations due to “excessive sensitivity to race and religion”.
The former secretary of the local community, now the anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so strong that the police must be allowed to set boundaries outside polling stations to protect the feared voters.
He suggests that voters take identification cards to prove who they are when they vote.
To date, voters should only indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests putting undisturbed inks on people's fingers when they hand out their newsletters, with the aim of excluding someone from voting twice.
It was necessary to provide the best protection for the informants, Sir Eric said.
He called for greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“It is not only to protect against fraud in elections but also to protect the local Government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet vote scandal in East London.
Last year, a special court dealing with electoral matters decided that the current mayor, Luftur Rahman, was to be removed from office due to a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman had “criminally distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and had silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rachman was said to have led his campaign on the basis that it was the duty of Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were questioned or were the result of a character when a person voted in representing someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the vote-vote fraud in which senior members of the Muslim community were reportedly exerting pressure on people to vote in favour of their candidate.
Sir Eric, in a photograph, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including requiring your identity card to prove who you are.
The report states: “The pressure exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, in particular women and youth, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in the communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin, was presented.
“There were fears that... public institutions had closed their eyes on such behaviour because of the overly sensitive “political adjustment” to ethnicity and religion”.
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including removing political activists from work with ballot papers to stop the harvest of votes.
The report, before Teresa May, also calls for enhanced registration checks to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration fraud and privileges.
An option is being considered to require voters to present their identification prior to the vote.
Use non-refractory inks on people's fingers as soon as they drop their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Carry out systematic checks on the nationality of people to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Insert a three-year limit on applications for automatic postal ballots.
Eliminate political campaign participants and activists from work with blank ballots and post-vote envelopes.
Give the police the authority to establish boundaries around polling stations.
Amend the law to facilitate the prosecution of intimidation under the 1983 People ' s Act.
Take illegal photographs at polling stations.
To require that only English be used at polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff force voters to go one by one.
Sir Eric has been violently attacking the city police, claiming that this is “awesome”, that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets case.
“The election court disqualified Luther Rahman and his agent for a long list of corruption and illegal acts”, he reported.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt — a criminal standard of proof — on a number of grounds.
It also criticises the resultsless “checks for the branch” of the polling department of city administrations.
Sir Eric stated: "The previous ruling of the Tower Hamlet court was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of parliamentary elections, yet the alarming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy as a bicycle analog to Kate and other Olympic counterparts in Rio
The fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio lost their minds this week at the French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prevo, who appeared to be strikingly like the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old participant in the Olympic Games is far from the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast of his own famous double, at least reported in the social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the celebrities on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has drawn up a list of Olympics with more than a surface similarity to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: A U.S. male archer member Brady Ellison, on the left, was compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s double bicycle track, many people on the Internet have rushed to indicate how a particular archer could be a twin of Leonardo DiCaprio’s superstar.
A U.S. male arch crew member, Brady Allison, became the cause of a hurricane on Twitter after an image of him that looked frighteningly like a wolf from Wall Street.
And in fact, the archer found out about the madness of social media and admitted that he'd heard that he looked like Leo since he was a kid.
“I personally do not see a huge resemblance, perhaps with the exception of vegetation on my face,” said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt show even more this year: a striking resemblance between British squire Greg Rasford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alia Mustafan, with her large sharp eyes, is said to be an accurate copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
In the South African swimming pool, Cameron Van der Bourgh was compared to the star of the Chorus by Matthew Morrison for many years.
Turning to the unexpected: This user thinks that Nathan is the “portual version” of the actor “Start”
Another long - standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who could boast of similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The silver medalist from Russia, Julius Efimov, can boast not only of tanned skin and light hair but of actress Anna Lynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, says the fans, looks like "Joseph Gorgon Levit's sports version".
Raw Women: Hope Solo Football Star on the left and Jennifer Carpenter on the right have the same faces and eyes
Not the only one: one Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of this pair.
One Twitter user recently approached the site to announce her admiration that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical.”
In fact, the U.S. football star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar faces and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of the actress Laura Linney, as well as the winning gold medal of Gabby Douglas' gymnast, who can boast of her own beautiful broad smile, which resembles the smile of the star Gabriel Union.
The Commentary of the Olympics at CBC apologizes for speaking of the Chinese float “dead as a pig”
Byron McDonald's analysis of the fourth place in the 14-year-old Ay Yanhan finale on a 4x200-m women's stage upsets the CBC's audience in a live broadcast of the Olympics.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of her commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese floater "started up like a stench" and "died like a pig" during the flood.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final women's 4x200m freestyle.
You could hear how McDonald, who was drawn to the CBC commentators' team to "dull it in color," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese woman threw out a ball, baby."
Too excited, started like a stench, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese floater Ay Yanhan, aged 14, passed the second stage of the estaphetate for 1:57,79 — 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rak, allowing Canadians to eliminate the distance from China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly on the net after being shaken with tone and expression
Emmet McFarlane tweeted, "Is it true that CBC's dictator just said that 14-year-old swimmers from China's dead like a pig?"
That idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
About Ay Yanhan from China in the final women's 4x200 m freestyle, they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped a ball, baby."
Criticism in Twitter immediately attacked Byron McDonald, and many urged him to fire him.
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was in charge of the CBC, apologized on direct air for McDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for the comment on the float. "
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened'.
The SAF concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to that statement
Commentator Scott Russell's friend had to apologize to McDonald's face
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments
The body also rushed to apologize and issue a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to air.
Last night, we acted expeditiously to apologize to our viewers on direct air and our subscribers in social media.
Let's be clear, Byron's comments were about talking to the floater, not about her as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday, McDonald apologized on direct air and tried to clarify his comment, stating that he did not think that his words interpreted him as an attack on a person.
'I would like to take this opportunity to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women',' he said on the broadcast of the Olympic Games at CBC.
'I was talking about being a swimmer, not her personally'.
'It goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I'm very sorry.'
Buyer Primark insulted a woman who immaculately painted her underwear in the middle of the store.
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman was naked to illustrate her panties on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she illustrated how she looked at them, pulled them down, and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually moved four pairs of underwear to the Bouverie Place store in Folkstone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place in Folkstone, where the woman used to put the knitted underpants before putting them back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson's mother, who was at the store at the time, said that after she had been wearing underwear, the mysterious woman again "went out and left the store without buying anything".
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the mall, she took a pair of panties out of the window, took off her own knickers and panties and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a place to do it, she was just standing there ashamed."
"They all stood up when she took off her panties again, and she clearly didn't like them, because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing with three other couples before she finally decided that there was nothing here that she liked, dressed again and went out.
"It doesn't look like she cared who was watching her, or that she thought about the person who was going to buy those panties that she framed."
33-year-old Jenny Davidson from Kent, said, "How do you think anyone's going to take home the pants that someone else has worn and they haven't been treated?"
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these clothes from the sale after she left -- well, better."
"I don't want to come home with a new pair of women's panties and find out what another woman did and took them off, and they weren't posted."
The representative of Primark said: “Primark knows about the incident that took place at our Folkstone store on Tuesday, 9 August”.
All the goods concerned were removed from the sale.
How to protect yourself from assaults with a gun using a cow.
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Ron Misrazchi, the Federation magistrate in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close range.
If they come to you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to beat up the robber of his weapon.
If they approach the rear, according to Misrazchi, the first thing to do is to turn around so that you can see the attacker and 'open the line of fire'.
Then you tighten the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting them with a free elbow.
Then you're knee-deep in the scent, and while the attacker's in pain, you're pulling a gun out of his hand, punching him in the face with a gun and going back, holding the gun on him.
For an armed, appropriate front, a way of execution, like, remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab a gun and twist it so that the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight onto the gun and hit the fist with your fist, then pull the gun out of its grip before you step back and aim at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video to see how Misachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of any robbery - if you're not a master cow-major - is to give your cash.
Traveller Jan Wright speaks his own language in Europe’s most filthy places
The British traveller has given his immune system and a rye reflex to a serious test, licking some of the most filthy and disgusting places in Europe.
The guide and author of books on the journeys of Jan Wright, 51, from Saffolk, spoke the euro bank note, the pearls of Circ Piccadilly, and the button removes the unitase on the train and the Russian public telephone to prove the strength of its immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which should be a film entitled “The Guide of the Traveller-Lizon on the Internal Force”, has produced some surprising results.
The idea of slipping a sink button on a train that thousands of others use may be extremely repulsive, but in fact there are worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
During his trip to Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and nurses about the increase in gut bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, none of the licks were more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright was known for his intestinal strength tests, traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public laundry at the railway stations to the toilet sink button, this task certainly tested his immune system.
In the film he filmed, he said, "From my childhood, I was completely indifferent to my health, and I dragged a lot of things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
Its test stroke demonstrated a luminometer of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison: newly washed hands must be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick, after its luminometer was more than 4,000, while the washed hands showed less than 60
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio filmed a film about a traveller entitled “The Guide of Traveller-Lizoon to the Internal Force”, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the toilet.
He said in the film, "It's close to one of the worst things I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The “Inland Power Guide of Traveller-Lizun” was removed along with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Rita Valio Gefilus, which contains oxygen bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice President Valio for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Wuorenmaa said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see, and at the same time could explain the benefits of the probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended with the idea of "let's call Jana."
They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in interesting form.
I also think the movie shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakal, who was the director of the film, added, "Let's just say I'd lose my respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, for example, the disgusting Russian toilet that was shown in the movie."
Of course, some things were easier for Jan to lick, and some were quite tough.
I'm glad that some of these licks were filmed.'
During the survey conducted in 2015, Valio, 84 per cent of respondents associated acidomolecular bacteria exclusively with good stomach and intestine condition, and 58 per cent said they were using at least sometimes the products containing added acidomolecular bacteria.
The hooligan family destroyed Saltash, the municipal home of Cornwall, before eviction
The hooligans' family left their municipal home with a loss of £50,000 after being evicted for intimidation of their neighbors.
Tania Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilkok were expelled from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they had been forced out of the property facility, shocked housing cooperatives discovered this property in a state of repair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the half was exposed, the debris was scattered across the floor, and the walls were sprinkled with graffiti.
The family is now displaced and is supposed to live in a private apartment
Donna McEvoy, a settler in Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid she wouldn't save him.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are many things to weigh, because this property is likely to be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation, and their name has a bad reputation.
The couple had three sons who had been living in a real estate facility from time to time, and the police reported that the reign of family terror included fighting in the streets with baseball bats, intimidation of residents of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive shouting, disputes and ridicule.
Skeldon, 47 whose name was on the lease, received an anti-social order in June.
In several rooms, a house that could be demolished found old garbage
The floorboards in the house where drugs were sold in the past were torn out
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and called the police regularly
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after being granted an extension of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
Eviction was welcomed with relief by neighbors who said that their lives had become a living hell.
One said, "They weren't worried about anyone."
We've lived with them for 20 years, and that's always been bad.
The number of times we saw the police here, it's unbelievable.
'We couldn't sleep that morning.'
We got up because it was so quiet in here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're gone, it's gonna be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing neighborhood team, said the family was unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and they regularly called the police.
The garbage and old toys were scattered down the growing side of the municipal home
He added: 'It's a disgrace that the lessor could not accept any responsibility for her and her family's behaviour, because eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have been horrifying for her watching neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done to give us information.
I hope that this development will provide some comfort to the neighbours and signal that no social behaviour will be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all a little over 20 at the time.
Filthy mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to remove the debris surrounding the house
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 years of cannabis, as well as weights, supplies and $1700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to the possession of Class B drugs for delivery.
She stated that the money was paid for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being made homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were sprinkled with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they will try to evict tenants who are not subject to the rental rules of the premises
Angela Crowe, of the Devon and Cornwall police, stated that the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel they can act without accusation from the prosecutor, and those who are harmed by such conduct', she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be allowed by the police of Devon and Cornwall, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low - flying military plane almost touched the beach
In the town of Aveiro, Portugal, tourists who love sunflowering were terrified of their lives.
The P-3C Orion Air Force of Portugal has flown incredibly low
The Air Force reported that it had carried out a training flight but insisted that there was no safety risk.
This is the moment when frightened tourists start panicking, while the low-flying plane is hovering over the overcrowded beach.
Dramatic images show a warplane flying almost at a distance from hunters on the sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The resters jumped on their feet as soon as they became for obvious reasons concerned about the noise of the aircraft's engines, but were not able to see that they were moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the town of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandez, one of several vacationers who published a video of a shocking spring in social media, said, "He flew down pretty low twice, and there was a time when it seemed to break up."
Nuno Arrozh added, "I've been surfing and I swear, it felt like the plane was about to fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were horribly frightened when the plane came out of the mist and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the P-3C Orion aircraft had been training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast and had to descend so low as it was the only way to verify them.
The pilot stated that the aircraft flew a little lower than usual due to the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal, as well as the lives of four people on Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today has made a statement that the pilot has had to fly so low due to circumstances — thick fog and smog from forest fires that have worsened visibility
The flight was a training flight, and the pilot was instructed to find fishing boats within the mission
The HASSP system has been compulsory for more than a year, but most St. Petersburg cafes and restaurants have not yet been introduced.
Checks are becoming more active, and the business is facing fines up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year now, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) - risk analysis and critical control points - have been mandatory for food producers and carriers, as well as for general education companies in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
Rossabnadzor's business verifications for compliance in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
However, for the time being, officials only issue fines for individual infringements of the regulations (see “The Review of Documents”).
In general, the failure to comply with the regulation would cost 600,000 rubles for the first infringement and 1 million rubles for the second.
HASSP, as a system that takes into account the risks of food and prevents it, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
It was the safety of astronaut food.
The system is now being used in all food industries not only in the United States, but also in Canada and in the European Union.
HASSP has been operating on TC territory since February 2015.
The business system was designed and implemented for 4 years (the JASSP requirement appeared in TC in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Unfortunately, we had long been convinced that the norm concerned only food products, not retorts, - explained the Head of the Social Council, Elena Cécerts.
Now everyone's trying to make up for what's missing.
Expected period of renewal of charter flights to Turkey - end of August - beginning of September.
But they're not going to call out a huge demand, because their target audience -- families with children -- is already preparing for school, experts say.
The Alliance of Tourism Agencies sent a letter to the Government yesterday requesting that the charters be cleared by now.
“For many Russian tourists, the issue of selecting quality and affordable sea holidays is insoluble, as most of the accommodation facilities in the Red Cross and Republic Crimea resorts are already banned by the end of September”, the authors note and stress that the opening of charter transport in August will not significantly affect the already established demand for Russian maritime products.
As reported in the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union of Tourism (RST), if Russian and Turkish aviation agencies agree quickly, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding, when the charters are reinstated, depends first and foremost on the aviation authorities.
Technically, aircraft can fly in September, even August, if the tour operators quickly build up the programmes and agree with the airlines on the necessary routes on board," says Pavel Rumenci, Deputy Director for Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Office of RT.
He said that the possible restoration of charters would be good news, but it would not have too much effect on the market, because the main buyers of charter tours -- families with children -- had already returned from their vacations and were preparing for school or on holiday in other countries.
In the velvet season, tourists and couples generally buy tours.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously," says Paul Romanians.
"Turkey has a chance to attract many tourists if it now makes very budget proposals - 50-60 thousand roubles for a two-way tour, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, Director General of Tourism Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, it is definitely not worth it, the main mass of travel is already planned.
Paul Rumensev also believes that since there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be needed, but it is not worth waiting for.
"For Turkey, starting charters now is the rehearsal of the next season," said Paul Romanians.
“The opening of charters in Turkey is a positive news for the next season”, says Valeria Rubtsov.
The Tax Code provides for the release from NDFL by law of compensation payments within the approved rules for damages caused by injury or other damage to health.
The provision of milk to workers employed in hazardous employment is provided for in article 222 of the RC.
At the same time, the rules and conditions of extradition are laid down by Order No. 45 of the Russian Federation of 16.02.2009.
According to this document, free distribution of milk or other equivalent foodstuffs is made to workers on days of actual employment in hazardous work due to the presence in the workplace of harmful productive factors.
On the basis of the above rules, the Russian FNF concluded in the letter under consideration that, pursuant to paragraph 2, paragraph 3, paragraph 2, of the RCB, the FNF is exempt from the taxation of NDFL income in the form of the value of milk issued to workers on the days of actual employment in hazardous working conditions in accordance with the Norms and the conditions approved by the Ministry of Health and Development of Russia of 16.02.2009 No. 45 n.
Moscow's Gazstrudbank was without a CB license.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew a licence for banking transactions from a credit organization The Business Stock Bank of GASTRAYBANK, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, ACB “GASTRAYBank” conducted a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of money in low-quality assets.
An adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable representation of the value of the bank ' s assets led to the credit organization ' s justification for the implementation of bankruptcy prevention measures.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in questionable transit operations.
A temporary administration is appointed in the bank until the appointment of a competitive manager or a liquidator.
The powers of the executive branch of the credit organization under federal law have been suspended.
ACS “GASTRAYBank” is a member of the investment insurance system.
It is recalled that the payment of insurance to investors, including individual entrepreneurs, under Federal Act No. 177-FZ “On the insurance of individuals' contributions to banks in the Russian Federation” is set at 100 per cent of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million rubies in total per investor.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will start no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the report, 335 seats in the banking system of the RF were held by assets of ACB GASTRAYBank as at 1 August 2016.
London Schoolgirl Who Joined IGIL Killed in Syria
Cadiz Sultan, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IGIL, is reportedly killed in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akundji stated that her family learned about her death in Racca, Syria, weeks ago.
It is believed that she died of a Russian air strike in Racca, a plot of faction in the country, as reported by the ITV News on Thursday.
The Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"It can only be hoped that the only advantage of this is the grave and will of others, that these are the risks involved in travelling to the war zone to persuade people to make the same choice at any time," Akunji said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London girls boarded a plane to Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana family was told that she married an IGIL fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reade states that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for Supreme Justice if elected
The leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reed, said he was convinced that the democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected President.
The Senate's Republicans blocked Garland's claim, but as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The head of the majority group at the Mitch McConnell Senate states that the next president will elect the person who will be able to replace the last Supreme Court judge, Antonin Scalia.
Reed said at the conference on Thursday that he was predicting that Clinton would choose Garland "with some degree of confidence".
Representative Reed later said that he had not talked to Clinton directly about whether she would make Garland, and was simply making assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton wouldn't want to "screw the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Colombia.
Reade said that the Republicans who blocked the nomination of the Garland were the “receptive” and “assistants” of the Republican candidate for President Donald Trump.
He said Trump was no match for the job.
Treatments states that erotic calendars for 'women, as well as men'
The Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Ballmer to produce a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of naked celebrities, they aim to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with naked museums.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of naked models is different from old-fashioned Playboy because Playboy is for men.
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is too.
“We need to return to the demonstration of the eternal and classical naked figure, where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of women’s body,” Shaw said in a press release publishing a calendar.
Women want to be a part of this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or personally in open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
The Moscowers will be handing out memories of unfaithful Internet stores.
In Moscow, they're going to release a memo telling us how not to be a victim of an Internet store.
This was reported in Rossabnadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that departmental experts are preparing a memo that will help citizens to correctly select online stores and identify possible fraud schemes.
The concept of this brochure includes several sections.
These will be general information and legislative frameworks, rules of delivery of goods, ways of protecting their legitimate rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how to make the claim correctly and so forth,” said Rosbnebnadsor.
The memory is being processed to date.
It will subsequently be posted on the Rosquibnadzir site in Moscow, and it is also planned to release a print version and distribute it to the Moscowers.
The Russian MID issued a statement calling the name of the second suspect in the Crimea diversion.
Detainees from Ukrainian and Russian nationals assisting in the preparation of terrorist acts.
Among them are Panov Evgeni Alexandrovich and Zethbei Andrey Romanovich.
“They all give confessions,” says the communication.
Formerly the resident of Zaporozhye Panov, who was detained on suspicion of terrorist attacks in Crimea, admitted his guilt in interrogation.
The FAS will strike Google at 438 million roubles.
The Russian Federal Anti-monopoly Service (FAS) imposed an administrative fine on Google’s 438 million rubles, according to the agency’s website.
“The penalty for violation of anti-monopoly legislation for Google was 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will implement our decision and pay a fine soon," said Deputy FAC leader Alexey Docentenko.
During the investigation, FAC found that Google only supplies smartphones to manufacturers sold in Russia, a Google Play app store, provided that other applications of the corporation are installed on the device.
Among these applications is a search engine, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates article 10, paragraph 1, of the FZ on the protection of competition (abuse of dominant position).
We are confident that compliance will provide an opportunity to develop competition in Russia's mobile P.P. market, which will have a positive impact on our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act must be respected by all companies whose products are delivered to the territory of the Russian Federation and transnational corporations, including," noted the head of the Communications and Information Technology Management Office of the Russian Federation, Elena Zaeva.
The government is suspected of collusion by 16 Russian shops.
The New Book Network was fined for selling the 50 Days Before My Suicide book.
The New Book Shop Network is fined for selling Stace Kramer '50 Days Before My Suicide', according to the Moscow City News Agency.
The text of the book may be considered “promoting or motivating the suicidal behaviour of children and adolescents” as reported in Rossabnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine.
The Permanent District Court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the dissemination of information products to children and decided to impose a fine with the confiscation of 49 copies of printed products arrested by the Rosbnekadzor's office.
The source at the New Bookstore confirmed that it was the work of Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that Moscow's largest bookstores had checks on the existence of a book “50 days before my suicide”.
There will be an evening in Moscow for the memory of Ernst the Unknown.
In Moscow it will be the night of the memory of sculptor Ernst Unknown, TASS reports.
The event will take place on 15 August in the Central House of Letters.
Unfortunately, not all will be able to say good-bye to the Unknown in the United States in person.
It was therefore decided to arrange this evening for those who wanted to mention it on their home land," the Russian Jewish Congress reported in the press service.
There it was noted that it was important for the widow of sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
The evening is attended by close friends of the Unknown, including the poet Evgeny Evtushenko, artist Boris Messererer, the president of the GMI of Pushkin Irina Antonova, director Mark Rosovsky, and Russian Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Culture Department of Moscow, Alexander Kibowski, deputy mayor of Moscow Leonid Pechatnikov.
Previously, it was reported that the relatives of Ernst Unknown planned to stage a sculpture of paniide in New York, allegedly until 14 August.
The end user blamed me: who really buys plates?
Single middle-aged men love guilt.
And as long as you haven't stopped squandering the section of comments with gross insults under the alias Not All Single Men of the Middle Years, this statement is derived from actual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the resurgence discussed is due not to the boom among a generation of two thousand who want to penetrate the novelty of the material, but to the nostalgia of the middle years.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album with a high probability range from 45 to 54 are reported.
Moreover, those who belong to the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
It's also not just an act of gathering lovers - it's emotional: older buyers are more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% versus 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% versus 66%).
But are youGov’s results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk down the center of lively Soho Street, in a modest gray suit and ferociously gesticulized before stopping, folding my hands and saying, "Well, let's see."
So let's see.
While Socho’s heart is slowly depriving himself of his charms and dirt — hotels, cafes, shopkeepers, Paperchase buildings, once occupied by independent sellers — several music shops with fantastic professionals have remained.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene where I'm close to the different people in some of these shops and try to assess their age and emotional mood through observation.
Glasgow Stewart, 55 years old, followed by Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably over 20 years old), in London at noon to meet, and strolling around shops to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
"I suppose so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
The plates above (he e-mailed me the pictures, I didn't follow him home) go through the walls of his hotel.
His reason for acquiring so many albums and singles is partly due to his available income: he can now buy plates that he couldn't afford when they came out and buy the items he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many of what I acquire is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are probably introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink much.
It's my fault.
Wes, 25 years old, who works in Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets fit the YouGov profile.
However, he noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media, people who heard about the return and felt the duty to buy their old plates.
Judging from the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection usually in about 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their guilt to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their plates," he says.
This may explain the boom among resurgents caused a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the plates?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wesa, some senior clients, among other things, have been insulted by a meaningless payment system.
Some guilt lovers may feel a shock from the digital world and prefer to move away from familiar plastic envelopes, objects that spark memories of impoverished youth.
“I think that sometimes it may be to fill the void or to possess material things as some kind of tranquillity, ” says Wes.
Since I'm a collector, I have it, and I think many people have it, too.
It's just a way to take your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from a patchwork.
The ICM survey in April showed that almost 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album last month had not listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% had a loser that they never use, whereas 7% of those who bought wine had no record-player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look seriously puzzled by the stalemate with the Bosanos.
The "trophy" aspect of recovery is what Johnny noticed, 42 years old, who works at Sounds of the Universe.
"Someone came in recently and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a radiohead plate so we can put it to ourselves," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but that's definitely how it happens.
More of a piece, less of music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not older, they're a little less than 20 people who just get to know it.
At Fopp, who now took almost the entire floor of the vinyl, a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are couples who are in their 70s who are photographers, adolescent boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less impervious than in the above-mentioned shops — the latest Sint- and Sexy-Pop Wild Beast, rather than the jazz improvisation, is permeable through the columns — it is nice to see the diversity in its customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish by standing 30 seconds with someone.
Eleonora, 27, went to Fopp for a few minutes, looking at various plates available for sale.
She's looking at goods, not wasting money.
She doesn't make much money, she says, so collecting plates is not a very appropriate option.
It's worth it.
Listening to music on a computer or another device is simple, but beauty blames it ..." - it is immersed in dreams of a sigh of love.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique.
My last stop is a store, which is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of fans who blamed the city's fashioners.
While I create an illusion that I'm looking at jeans-wearing shorts, I'm watching a group of teenage girls gathering around the Polaroid cell every minute before the father and his daughter start discussing the purchase of Crosley's player.
On the left is a staircase, which has a wall with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Wyinhouse and Fleetwood Mac plates: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory plates for any medium collection.
No one is watching — perhaps because they are just ornaments, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "artificial guilt."
But given that any attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and send several clients to the Soho depths for a while, there was little to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the population that is more likely to have more time and money than most people have is the layer that spends most money on luxury items, such as guilt.
But as long as my findings show that YouGov's results are accurate, at least in Soho's plate stores, they do not exclude the existence of a large number of female collectors and winemakers who exist in reality, in plastic stores and online forums.
These people probably work all over the school or office.
But they obviously don't spend the mornings of Thursday, walking around a plate store on Berwick Street, stripping plates and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake leader who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland’s shark, the longest living vertebrate animal, is a video report
Scientists claim that Greenland’s polar shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, claims that the female record has reached the age of 272 to 512 and five metres.
The French court rejects the offer to demolish the Jungli refugee camp
The French court rejected the offer of the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At court hearings this week, Calais stated that the State should be able to handle a total of 72 custom stores, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer a haircut or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or simple meals for several euros in self-made restaurants.
Kale’s prefecture said that these places should be reduced because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they bear fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, claiming that free meals offered by the Government association and other groups do not provide sufficient food for the growing number of people in the camp.
They said that supermarkets and restaurants often provide blood and free food to those in need.
The Lyll Court held that there was no legal basis for expelling 72 self-employed shop managers, but stated that Kale's problems were “completely understood”.
Judge Jean-Françua Molla said that baccales, cafes and restaurants played a much more important role than simply feeding people who “live in extremely fragile conditions”.
He said that the spaces provided safe points of contact for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition was the Jungley Children's Book of the Camp, which does not work for the benefit of the day, offers 200 meals, English and French language classes, and advice on providing shelter for hundreds of vulnerable minors without being escorted to the camp.
Over 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian stated that its closure “would be a disaster for these children, some of them not over eight years of age”.
Two charities, Assistance to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, were assessed on Friday that the number of Jungle camps had grown to over 9,000 — the highest in history — after a dramatic increase in arrivals during the summer.
Micro-region libraries invite young free people to their educational programs.
This week, the branch library will hold meetings on City Day, the Year of Russian Cinema, and even the Day of Physical Arts.
The programmes are focused on the children ' s audience, so most of them will be in play.
Today, 10 August, the branch library No. 2, in the interplanetary microregion, invites the small town to a cruise presentation.
On August 11th, I'm going to be in branch No. 1 "I live in this town, I know this city."
There will be a multimedia lesson on the same day in the Library No. 2 on the same day, “The Land of the Past Fate”.
And in branch No. 4 in Suraževka, the film, film, film program.
On Sunday, 14 August, for the northern microregion, the branch library No. 3 will play the play programme "Fizcult Hello!".
Britain stops on silver in Regby 7, after the Fiji Masters allow them to take gold
The impressive series of the British in Regby-7 was brought to a halt by the final obstacle of the Fiji team in the final on Thursday evening, when they were completely destroyed 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji has given a master-class in the possession of the ball, dismemberment, support of the game, running lines and rough power to win gold — their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor consolation in the form of silver — the third in Britain a day — and they were proud of their efforts in the first Olympic competition on Regby 7, which defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on the way.
The painful beating of Boxes, 7-5 in the semifinals earlier on the same day, could come back to negatively affect them in the finals.
But no matter what, Fiji was won in this form by a better team of 15.
This may be some comfort for Britain — but probably not — that at least one British will hang a gold medal on his neck tomorrow — chief coach Fiji - Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
It was a journey for the British.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.
This is where they lost only one.
These blows will cause pain, but progress is remarkable.
Fiji started out great, for fun, reflecting on Britain's attempts to intercept the ball.
It was like bumping into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and World Series champions went up to 5-0 when Osea Collinsau dived into the corner.
Having four minutes in the hours of Jerir Tuwai added another touchdown on the right flank, which was implemented.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great attempt at interception of Mitchell has kept the man of Mount Leon Nakavu from killing a third, but this has only delayed Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jas Veremalou made a touchdown in the right corner, and the UK lost 17-0.
Nakawa added another one after the resumption and there were still more minutes at the hour... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravo then broke through several more formal attempts to intercept the British and stormed the line to get a score.
The implementation led to a break of 29-0.
It seemed as if Fiji was born to play in Regbi-7, while Britain still masters the trade.
Which is largely true.
The UK has made a massive half-game replacement, and they've booked a Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which was good by the standards of the first half until Joshua Tuisov went through a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton caught an attempt on Britain by making a touchdown in the left corner to account 36-7, but the game was long gone on the way of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags, and danced on the stands.
It was impossible not to admire Fiji’s full joy.
Mata Villam decorated a Fijian cake that did not need adornment, another attempt at the last few seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier that same day, Fiji had defeated Japan 20-5 in its semifinals, and Britain had slightly lost South Africa in a tense semifinal of one attempt at each, the difference between the British realization.
Kyle Brown pulls Boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some amazing legwork, he rips the line and beats it under the balconies in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercept Marcus Watson, a brother on the 15th side of England's team, Anthony, won the victory — and in the end, the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to win the rowing fight of the coach with cancer
There'll be no more exciting gold in these games, and that says something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy lifts in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the added value of their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who were pulling the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of Coach Robin Williams was always there as they sought second rank Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in British sports annals to reach that height.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end, their 39th undefeated speech, once again unprecedented.
What we see is that the two brilliant athletes sliding around the surface with the elegance of a swan do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind each gold comb, a battalion of ready-made hands that contributed to the gradually increasing victories that mattered, and no arms that were more important than the hands of a trainer who, 30 months ago, was diagnosed with cancer, did not know whether he would live to see that day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous thing.
I had bladder cancer, which was one of the things they could operate on, and they did.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
This could have been a pretty bad situation.
She's changing your looks a little bit for the future.
Williamsu was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky to be able to start treatment early in 2014 in the inter-seasonal, keeping the schedule gap at a minimum if this could be the right expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed payment, so I had to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking in the ward — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they were talking quite a few steps.
That's how it starts.
Grief in itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
In the next moment, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own feelings.
Stanning, captain of the artillery regiment with service in Afghanistan behind his shoulders, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week, maybe it's a little too much, but it means so much."
It just confirms how much this means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and so does Robin.
It's been fantastic for three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a single race in five years.
The couple set a tense pace that their competitors could never match.
Even in the last 500 metres, when New Zealand and Denmark's teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We've been through a lot.
Helen said, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's very important not to get involved right now.
We had a good start, and at the same time we weren't trying to do something amazing.
We weren't expecting fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to get a good turn and get out and win this race, which we did.
It's gonna take a year to figure out your future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, at her own TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
London took about six months to realize that I had become the Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
Government has extended the period of destruction of sanctions products
The Government has extended until the end of 2017 the destruction of foodstuffs prohibited from entering Russia.
The relevant order was signed by Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo on countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was imposed in our country in August 2014.
The ban was subsequently extended repeatedly and is now in force until 31 December 2017.
It is prohibited to import certain agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein into Russia.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruit and milk products have been banned.
The disposal of food imported into the country into the embargo has been taking place in Russia since August 2015.
For the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tonnes of prohibited products were removed from sales.
He's looking for a protestor.
Rain and thunder are expected in Moscow on Friday.
The capital region will pass through an atmospheric front that will bring precipitation and lower air temperature.
The air is heated to 25 degrees Fahrenheit [25 ° C] by day.
For example, on the night of Saturday, Moscow will have short-term rains, thunderstorms and winds up to 15 m/s.
During the day, rain with thunderstorms and winds are expected to rise to 12-17 m/s.
Rains with storms are also forecast in the Orlovska, Kurski and Voronez oblasts, reports "Dni.ru".
The precipitation is unlikely next week.
The WTO arbitrators ' panel found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the organization ' s rules.
Import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia upon accession to WTO.
“This is the first case in which the WTO has taken a decision against the RF”, says a communication on the organization's official website.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union had not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures “were systematic” or “were comprehensive”.
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties to paper and refrigerators as soon as possible.
This is referred to in a communication from the Russian Ministry of Economic Development.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to complain to the World Trade Organization about Russia ' s actions, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is referred to in a statement by the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times said that US behaviour in resolving dispute issues in WTO undermined the principles of discussion adopted by the organization.
Such a statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members because of the refusal of the Americans to approve, for a second term, Judge Chan Song Hwa of South Korea.
Russia would therefore not turn to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against the FF.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now includes 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The President ' s administration was replaced by a leader
Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed former Deputy Deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Vayno as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin moved to the presidency and hoped that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
Anton Vayno, in turn, stated during the meeting that he believed that the important anti-corruption work that he had begun as head of the President's administration was important and promised to cooperate with the Government.
Previously, “Investments” wrote that experts viewed the resignation situation of Sergei Ivanov as the head of the transparent and understandable administration and that there was nothing in principle that would change the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head, who has worked for the President's administration for a long time, has effectively built the work of the AP.
He was replaced by the Deputy Chief of Administration, Anton Vayno, who knew the specifics of the work.
In Poland, it is assumed that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
PGNIG, a state-owned Polish petroleum company, does not rule out that in a few years, gas from the RF may become unattractive to it because of the conversion to fuel from Norway and other countries.
The Vice President of the Polish Finance Company Boguslav Mažez reported on this.
His words are given by TASS.
"It may happen that we will not buy gas at all (in Gazprom), we will now diversify our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main routes of delivery will be East, CNG and Norway raw materials," said Mažec.
Gazprom currently dominates gas supply to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier had placed almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first half of 2016, which was 30 per cent higher than the 2015 level.
The share of Russian gas giants in PGNIG procurement increased to 49.8 per cent compared to 40 per cent earlier.
Let us recall that on 22 July, the anti-monopoly department of Poland did not agree on the establishment of a joint venture Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Northern Stream-2 pipeline.
Poland left a request for Gazprom to supply 11 billion cubic metres of gas on the North Stream-2.
That was stated by the Vice-President of the Holding Board, Alexander Medvedev.
The North Stream 2 auction will take place in 2017 and an auction is scheduled to take place in autumn 2016.
At the end of May it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to take any action in connection with the intention of the Polish side to renounce long-term gas contracts from Russia after 2022, said the Deputy Chairman of the Board of the company Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, Poles had only increased by 42 per cent in the purchase of gas from the RF.
Zampre Gazproma added that the fact that a Polish PGNIG application to the Stockholm arbitral tribunal did not yet mean the termination of negotiations.
The Polish company had previously applied to the judiciary to reduce the purchase price of Russian gas.
Remember, Polish Government Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Petar Naimsky, said that the Polish authorities had decided not to extend the gas contract to Gazprom.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, Polish Government Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Petar Naimsky, stated that his country could give up the supply of blue fuel from the east after six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas to Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country to the Norwegian shelf.
The North Stream-2 provides for the construction of two sea-gas pipeline threads with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine's Crimea border.
This was reported by the first member of the SMM in Ukraine, Alexander Hugg.
“I can confirm that the SM has increased the number of observers in this area,” he said, responding to the issue of journalists, referred to “RIA Novosti”.
According to the OSCE, the situation at the border of Ukraine and the Crimea is calm, there are no security incidents.
Observers monitored the three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
There was a video of a passenger plane named Jak-42 landing at Ufa Airport, which had climbed off the runway for 400 metres and crashed onto the left wing.
The video was released by "360".
The CP happened at 4:30 in Moscow.
The cruise of Krasavia has come from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place without casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to a parking lot.
Ufa Airport is operating in normal mode.
The Coastal Investigation Office of the CDC has been investigating the cause of the tight landing of a liner aircraft.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-prevented areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but UN envoy for Syria Steffan de Mistura finds the fact that it has not been disputed.
Such statements were made before the third round of the inter-Syrian negotiations, which should begin in late August in Geneva.
UN specialists have initiated investigations into reports of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information on the toxic gas terrorist, allegedly chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
At that time, the opposition stated that in an area where a Russian military helicopter had been hit before, the aircraft dropped the toxic bomb, but in Moscow these allegations were called a drop.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defence accused the opposition group Harakat Nur al-Din al-Zinki.
Soon it became known that two bombs were made with toxic gas.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, the burning of my eyes, it became difficult to breathe," the eyewitness quoted it as saying.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of the poison gas is confirmed by the experts, the operation will be considered a war crime.
United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura told reporters: “The evidence that this has actually happened is a lot.”
The prohibition of the use of chlorine for military purposes is laid down in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of chlorine used by the Syrian army against the “moderate opposition” in 2015.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that the attacks on its areas are carried out daily and the terrorists are obstructing the removal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the United Nations expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in hostilities.
The current regime of daily three-hour silence in the organization is considered “not enough to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped”.
Humanitarian Adviser Staffana de Mystura Jan Egelann stated that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required to deliver relief and evacuation to the city every week.
“We have to send heavy cargo from the colonized trucks in the area where the roads are practically destroyed, and the remaining goods are mined”, said Mr. Egelann. “But the Russian delegation confirmed its willingness to sit with us at the negotiating table.”
Consultations in Geneva between the United States and Russia on the establishment of a humanitarian break continue.
How Russia opened the humanitarian windows in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia, announced on 11 August the introduction of a three-hour cessation regime, which will operate daily from Thursday.
The creation of “humanitarian windows” is intended to provide conditions for the delivery to the city of medicines, food and essential items.
The decision of the RF Mini-Defense was taken against the backdrop of increasing international pressure on Moscow, demanding that the military operation be terminated and that the negotiation process be resumed.
As a result of a series of explosions in Thailand ' s resorts, four people were killed.
Immediately, several explosions occurred in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed and 19 were injured.
The epicenter of the explosions hit the city of Hua-Hin.
Ten foreigners were among the victims, four nationals, and no Russians were among them.
The responsibility for the incident has not yet been taken by any of the terrorist groups, but the country ' s IMF has rushed to state that Islamists are not involved.
Several people are suspected to have been detained.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the magnitude and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the lead country of the military.
The attacks took place in popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the area of Phuket and the town of Hua-Hin, Trang and Surat-Tani.
Since the arrival of the military junta to power in 2014, economic growth has declined from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism has remained one of the few sectors that have demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people visited the country, 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of attacks have already been detained, according to Colonel Krisana Patanacharoen.
As early as possible, he added, but in the IMF countries “are confident that they are not associated with international extremist groups”.
It is too early to draw conclusions, said Mr. Patanacaroen.
But we know for a fact that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, they're actually local diversions, and we're trying to identify those behind them.
The explosion occurred on the day of the Queen of Thailand, Sikrit.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its main priorities, and the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to the General of the Police, Sithicha Shrisopacharonrat, the bombs were detonated remotely at half an hour apart.
They were hidden inside trees on lively streets filled with restaurants by tourists.
It is already known that one of the four victims was a Thai girl who traded street food.
The other victims are still unknown, but they are known to be residents of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them four German nationals, three Dutch nationals, two Italian nationals and one Austrian national.
There are no Russian victims of the explosions, Russian press reported on Rosturism.
Local experts also link the explosions to the referendum that took place on 7 August, where 61.4 per cent of the country ' s population supported the draft new constitution.
It was drafted by a constitutional commission appointed by a military junta.
Voters needed to determine whether they supported a system in which the upper chamber of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and played a significant role in the election of the Prime Minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Remember, on 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the Pryut Chan-Ocha Army Commander.
At that step, he said, the army had promoted the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military established the National Council for Peace and Order, imposed curfews and censorship, drove up the protestors and the upper chamber of Parliament.
Like Bangkok in a state of emergency
The Government of Thailand, led by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat in January 2014, announced the establishment of a state of emergency in Bangkok and adjacent provinces.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
It's like there were two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, at the centre of Bangkok, a victory monument held by one of the main protests occurred two explosions that affected 28 people, five of whom were in critical condition.
The explosions occurred on motorcycles unknown.
The authorities strengthened security measures in the capital and attracted military forces to protect demonstrators.
The development of conditions began in Dry Log.
As the “U” has been known, the Government is requested to agree on the draft terms of the auction on the gold mine of Suha Log with the continuation of two key restrictions.
It is proposed that the company, where 25 per cent and more belong to foreigners, should not be allowed to auction, and that there would not be at least 25 per cent of the State.
The industry did not expect the Government to rewrite the conditions, noting that many players would not risk taking the difficult and expensive project.
The auctions can be announced in August and held in October.
The mineral industry introduced to the Government a draft order and terms for auctioning the largest undeveloped gold mining site in Russia, Suha Log (Irkutsk area, stocks and resources, 130 million ounces), two sources of "U" familiar to the situation.
The project was introduced on Wednesday evening, one of them clarified.
The Ministry of the Interior confirmed that the project had been implemented by the Government.
The representative of Vice Prime Minister Alexander Klonopin, who is responsible for the use of non-nuclear weapons, said, "U" that the project had not yet been received in the clerk's office.
“The auction may already be announced in August, immediately after the Government has issued its order, and given the time limit for the collection of applications for potential participants (at least 45 days) may already take place in October”, the Ministry of the Interior said.
According to the U, the project retains two key requirements for potential participants, as set out in the version, which was sent to the ministries and FOIVam in July (here at the “U”).
The first is the presence in the capital of the contenders of at least 25% of the state.
The second is the denial of access to auctions for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on innovation in strategic societies.
According to the two draft articles of the FZ, as already written by U on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (25% and above) are not tax residents of the FF or who have dual nationality may not be allowed to auction.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, as Suha Log refers to the federal nedrama (stocks of over 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of the Interior confirmed that the project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies”, but refused to comment on the details prior to the Government ' s order.
The demand for equity of the auction participants was made by the Irkutsk Region, which was said in December 2015 by the "U" in the "Minpriroda" and confirmed later that the Governor of the Region was Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Interior by his predecessor, Sergei Eroshchenko, "who had an investment agreement with Rostech".
The "U" interlocutors do not specify the restrictions on the admission of aliens.
"But this is in the spirit of time: not to give control in Russia's largest gold scene against Western sanctions," says the interlocutor "U", familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The head of the Ministry of the Interior, Sergei Donskaya, said on 1 August that foreigners could “go to the consortium” if the contenders attracted them “as a financial structure, as a technology partner”.
"U" interlocutors believe it is unlikely that conditions will be adjusted in the Government.
The industry's main contender for Sulei Log is the consortium of the largest gold miner of the PAO Poles, controlled by Suleiman Kerimova Saidu and Rosteha.
As "U" wrote, in July the partners created SP "SL Gold", where the "Police" 51% down, with the structure "Rosteha" RT-GR - 49%.
In Rostéch, comments were rejected, Paul stated that “U”, that “of course, they are interested in this asset” and have all the necessary competences and resources for its development.
“But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be taken after the announcement of conditions”, added Paul.
AFROSA may be involved in the auction, but the decision behind the government of the RF was made by sources of "U".
Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, who are developing assets in Chukotka, claimed to be involved in the development of the Dry Logo, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to U, were not interested in the asset.
In December 2015, the head of the Union of Gold Manufacturers, Sergei Kashuba, estimated the "U" investment in Suhai Log in $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential candidates are intimidated not only by the level of investment, but also by the complexity of the project: serious exploration of stocks and complex ore technology is needed, according to the U interlocutors in the industry.
On the pension market, the largest M&A deal, the “KIT Finance Pension Administrator”, launched the merger of four supervised NPFs.
As a result, the Gazfund Pension Stockpiling will create NPFs with a stock of around 373 billion rubles.
The establishment of a procedure for the merger of four pension funds - KIT Finance, Promagrofund, Inheritance and Gazfund Retirement Stockpiling - was reported yesterday by the owner of 100 per cent of the KIT Fund of the Pension Administrator.
“Reorganization shall be carried out in agreement with the CB, subject to the requirement that the terms of the contracts in force shall not deteriorate,” the company stated.
The compound is based on the Gazfund Pension Stockpiling.
According to NPF Director Oleg Bialashicki, the pooling of funds has several challenges: increasing the geography of presence, concentration of resources for development, lowering costs, replicating best practices of each fund and optimizing corporate governance.
He said that the indicative deadline for the completion of consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger, the Gazfond Pension Stockpiling will be the largest player in the ATP market.
As of 31 March, the number of pension savings of the pooled funds exceeded 373 billion roubles.
According to reports on the fund site, the beneficiaries of their owner, “KIT Finance Pension Administrator”, are Anatoly Gavrilenko (through the controlled CCS owns 65 per cent) and the Gazfond NPF (35 per cent).
However, the group itself started much later than competitors.
For example, the O1 PNF control group “The Future” devoured Stalfond early this year.
The combined NPF now joins Uralsib and Russian Standard.
“The integration into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary for structural tasks”, notes NPF Director “Towards” Nikolay Sidorov.
Active work on the consolidation of the funds since April is also being carried out in the Safmar pension group, "European", "Education and science" and "Regional Fund" to join the Safmar Saffmar NPF until the end of the year.
In 2017 they will be joined by the Trust NPF.
“The pooling of funds will increase the control of risks, operational processes and expenditures”, Safmar noted in the pension group.
A break in the pooling of funds supported by the “KIT Finance Pension Administrator” may be caused by several reasons, experts indicate.
Until recently, NPFs had been unable to buy more than 40 per cent of the volume of infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively placed.
Following amendments to the CB regulation in March of this year, there are no more restrictions on a number of issuers that comply with the regulatory requirements.
If necessary, the entire issue can buy out one big game", says the director of the AKRA Financial Institute Ratings Group Yury Nogin.
Several NPF leaders from top-15 for assets are called separation of spheres of influence and, as a consequence, personnel appointments in a single fund that group owners were required to agree on.
Yesterday Anatoly Gabrielenko was not available for comments.
At the request of "U" in the NPF "Gasfond", they also did not respond.
While consolidation of funds is a labour-intensive and costly activity, it will be justified at a long distance.
According to the Director of the Pension Partner Affiliate, Sergei Okolešev, fewer outflows from the Gazfonda Pension Stockpiling, accession will stabilize the base of the other funds of the group.
In doing so, a better experience of KIT Finance and Promagrofund will be sought in the construction of retail sales of SFOR, as well as in the use of a more modern PIC.
The requirements of the CB for processes and staff of the NPF are constantly increasing, and it is not appropriate to duplicate the infrastructure in four funds under a single investment policy, according to Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director of Corporate Ratings, Expert RA.
“The effect of reducing the duplicate functions will clearly offset the possible costs of the merger”, notes Mr. Mitrofanov.
The cost of pooling four funds is estimated at between 30 and 50 million roubles.
“The cost of the four funds for such amounts is approximately 400 million roubles per year, with the medium term being consolidated, the budget actually halves”, Mr. Okolenov is confident.
The Russian sale was the best of Pete and his dragon's dysneev cinema.
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the elegant dragon, the soul story and the country-style song are enough to re-believe old-fashioned magic, according to ELENA KRAVZUN.
The frightened little one was fined up by a dragon who became a human baby - sitter and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, after a puppy from a fairy tale book, and plays with him in the tracksuits and falls asleep in the picture.
Six years later, he is no longer different from another crafted forest sorbet, Maugli.
In this way, Pitt finds a red-haired female eger Grace (Brice Dallas Howard), while Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively rolling the forest.
Now she will not only have to believe that there is a dragon but also help save it.
Pete is taking an accelerated course of being human in the area of idyllic Americans wearing cowboy shirts, moral code in the heart and smiling more blindly than in any commercial.
No character looks or acts too terrible for the viewer to really hate him or fear him.
Even Gavin, who has been hunting an untypical subterranean forest dweller, is far from the wrong villain.
The huge smoke - filled dragon has also come from the heart of the bulldog, the airwaves of the wing, and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon is fun to scream, muttering, even wheezing, and, fortunately, it does not say, but it always wants to be caressed, so it is beneficially different from all the famous cinematographic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner are maintained by such high emotional involvement that, at the most tense moments, they begin to weep desperately in three hands, not only by small viewers, but also by adults.
Amazingly good and underage Oaks Figley in the role of Pit, breaking up between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtually betrays a canonic grandfather who would love to have literally every child.
How did the director David Lowry manage to download a fantastically nice masterpiece of the forgotten Disney movie Dracón Pitt of 1977, which was mediocre from the nose to the tail end and which was only remembered by a mix of animation and game film and made it the most soul film of the summer?
Not unless it's a miracle.
In his painting, Lowry took only two things from the original: the Orphan Pete and the Dragon.
There are musical numbers on board and most of the weird jokes.
This good story reads cartoons from "Bambi", "Innoplanetian" and many other nice children's hearts.
Disney Studio continues to successfully expand the high-quality masterpiece gallery of the twenty-first century.
Of course, Pete and the Dragon isn't as wonderful as The Jungle Book, and it doesn't have the skilled villain Kate Blanchett was in the role of a stepmother in the new Zoo.
But this naive film is no less successful in believing in miracles and good in the best dysneev traditions.
By the way, the key to Disney's magic castle, director Lowry, will get another one for the artistic cinematography of Peter Penn's story.
The David Lowry tandem worked at Pete and his dragon, and the screenwriter Toby Halbrooks, entered a new ambitious project on a non-increasing boy named James Barry.
RBK journalist Aleksandru Sokolova is facing new charges
Journalist RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov's lawyers, accused of organizing the extremist structure, said that the prosecution had found fault with their defence.
We learned from the investigators just yesterday that the prosecution had made such a statement.
We were scheduled to take part in a court hearing on the issue of limitations on criminal matters, but there was no final meeting, and the investigators informed us of the prosecution's presentation," the BRC quoted Olga Dinze's lawyer as saying.
She explained that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had indicated that investigators were not in conformity with the qualifications of the case and the materials collected.
The investigators will now have to remove the gaps in the evidence base and present Alexander Sokolov with a new indictment.
Either there will be another article of the Penal Code (KC) or there will be the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze clarified.
As reported by U, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the prosecution the wording of “pushing political conditions towards instability” and “returning power illegally”.
Correspondent Comersantbossport ALEXANDR ZILBERT lived the Olympics in the Olympic Village, inspected the house of the Russian assembly, had lunch in the local dining room, and even passed the WADA test.
Life doesn't seem to be dying for a second.
Even at night.
The final launches sometimes end at midnight, after which athletes need another hour and a half to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, there is a settlement and eviction from the village, as some athletes finish their statements and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, just arrive here.
At 7:30 a.m., heads of all Olympic delegations were drawn to one of the temporary tents.
At these gatherings, we usually discuss some operational household issues, as the head of the Olympic team, Igor Kazikov, the Olympic team leader Igor Kazikov, tells us. - Even though the house where our family was located is considered to be a model, it was first placed in operation and demonstrated to all the examiners, even in it there are some shortcomings.
The one with the hot water problem, then, I'm sorry, with the toilets.
We fought for cleanliness for a long time.
First of all, nobody came to clean.
And then the clinicians came, but they just peed on some substance on the floor and everything.
They have fields, see if you can see any innovations.
Mole, you can't wash them humanly.
We know these fields, laminate ordinary!
In general, the clinic company has been changed and now it's OK.
The Olympic Village is South Butovo, a sleeping area fenced on one side of the mountains, with an impressive roar, water - filled areas.
And for safety, there's still a two-meter iron fence around the perimeter, along which the automatics walk.
The village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings, a huge Russian flag hangs — the house is fully dedicated to our assembly.
Looking at the small lobby at the entrance, we can immediately identify the problems that seem to be the most pressing problems for the national team.
There are two announcements on the registration stand: "Please don't throw paper in the toilet!" and from the hand "I'll give you a badge.
The stand itself drowns in tracts.
Their cheerful bloom contrasts with the headlines of the brochure: “Remembrance on infectious diseases for departing in Rio de Janeiro”, “First aid in drowning, loss of foreign body in airways, loss of consciousness – stages of heart and lungs resuscitation”, “First aid in burns, heat attacks, fractures and bleedings”.
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example: “Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent treatment.
However, not all are waiting for a favourable outcome.
Of course, there is a medical center in the assembly of Russia that is ready at any time to provide home residents with qualified assistance, including relaxing and sporting massages.
In contrast, the centre is the headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door, there's an inspiring poster, "No matter what, we're gonna win!"
And, of course, the poems:
All the arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear them believe in them.
Let the less of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not retreat, not break!
And even more so is the announcement: "Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia, Kirilla has the spiritual care for the sportsmen of the Olympic assembly of Russia.
You can order a request and other requests by phone...
In fact, there is a Center for Meditation and Religious Worship for representatives of all denominations in the village.
Well, the Russians, in a privileged position, they have their own clock.
Because of the load of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the staircase, which is recommended for use during the fire.
And in the darkness came a glimpse of the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping companions of the new clinic company.
I believe that at any time they were ready to throw themselves at the washing of innovative sexes, they decided to have a quiet time right on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I had a meeting with a longtime acquaintance, Vitali Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our Batutists, who brought them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He kindly agreed to show off his rooms with the European champion Jan Pavlov.
There's nothing to complain about, it's the impressions of a decent coach in Russia, living on two beds, of course, almost standing there, but it's not critical.
Sunusel's one in four, but he's spacious.
The cabinet, of course, funny, from the fabric, does not inspire confidence, but there is something you can put on.
"No, you're making tea with them over!" she's handing out a tennis player named Svetlan Kuznetsov, who I met in the main dining room.
The main one is called, at least because it represents an area of 27,000 square meters and is ready to accommodate 5,000 visitors at the same time.
There's 60 thousand servings on top of here all free of charge.
The menu options are: “The best in Brazil”, “Houses of Peace”, “Asian dishes” and “Pissy, pasta products”.
The last option, as I watched, is very popular with our volleyball players.
But let's say I didn't find any soup in any of the units at the giant restaurant.
What kind of soups?
It's a good thing I got Chinese with me, cooked up.
And a teapot.
But in general, to be clear, we have worse food on our court.
There's something you can choose here, despite the unbearable uniformity.
I personally chose a couple cobbler and a tomato sauce.
In addition to each dish, there is a plate with its name in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, as well as an indication of the nutritional value of the product and the availability of allergens.
Well, it's good to admit it was edible.
I don't even know why this is happening all the time in local McDonald's.
Affluent, relaxed sportsmen can be said to be waiting for our best friends, representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They're tricking the Victorian, the winner of which is wearing a T-shirt.
They provoke, you might say!
To receive a gift, at least eight out of ten questions must be answered correctly.
I've been attacked by a virgin from WADA.
But that's not what she attacked.
So I'm in a patriotic mood, naturally.
The situation had become more acute on the second question: "If I have received a notification of the doping-control process, should I immediately go to the doping-control point?"
I said, "No, I've got an hour."
Lost, so to speak, vigilance.
I forgot that the WADA does not have to wait.
In general, we need to appear immediately.
At the seventh stage, my situation became quite critical.
I thought, for some reason, that if I find it difficult to maintain a balanced diet because of my dense schedule (and for me, it is difficult!), then I could use bioaddics to get “an additional nutrients to increase my productivity”.
No, they won't!
More precisely, the reply is formulated in a way that is not categorically prohibited but strongly rejected in several proposals.
That's not fair, WADA!
What's up, Russia?
There is nowhere behind Ephim, Isinbaev, and our entire, unblemished team.
That's why I've been focused, and I've won an unfortunate T-shirt.
Know what it says, ours!
In a winning mood, I took to the next-door fitness center.
I'm counting the trainers.
He's got 250.
Surprisingly, this accumulation of treadmills did not reveal any Russian athletes.
But maybe it's the right thing to do.
Let someone who can't play train!
And there was this guy sitting in a nearby clinic.
Back to the eye specialist.
Don't worry, don't worry.
In a polyclinic, like all over the village, there's no spit hanging condoms.
There is an encouraging call on it, "Stand with a condom."
Further, the iron resembles the handle of a door lock and the condoms made from the Amazonian natural latex are readily released.
I took it for granted.
The athletes won't wake up, they've got 450 grand.
The Olympic Village has a whole entertainment center for its holiday and holiday time.
It has a knowledgeable table beside it, reminding me that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day in various ways on athletes.
The center is flooded with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey, and some weird video-training devices.
What's that? - I'm interested in a comrade in the form of a Ukrainian assembly who actively uses a wild toy.
Of course, you could just say that he doesn't want to talk to a person in the form of a compulsive Russia, yes and all.
Here, by the way, by some strange coincidence in the eyes of the boys in yellow and blue.
The most playful is done.
It takes at least three hours to bypass the entire village by looking at each corner.
But if you're walking, not riding on electric cars, you're going to have a Canadian tannery house with a moose at the entrance and a dressing room, and a ticket office, and a laundry office, and a dry cleaner, and a hairdresser's shop, and a flower shop, and a coffee shop, and an e-mail with everyday goods, and a unique brand (only you can't wait until you're from Chinese philatelicists), and a bank, and a finder's office, and a photocopist.
Later in the evening, you will be seated next to an olive tree hung by colorful ribbons in memory of the friends and relatives of the athletes who left the world.
And you'll be under the accompaniment of a car, untiringly spraying liquid to kill insects, thinking of eternal life.
I mean, the Olympic movement.
Which doesn't stop for a minute in this village.
Until the rest of the Russian world breathlessly watched as the Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, the real sicksters left the net.
Few people know that the news is that Inna Deriglasov won the gold in the XXXI rapier at the Olympic Games, I got the first one.
Maybe I'm the only Moscow guy who saw it happen, not counting the ones who saw the Carioca competition that night.
That can only be understood by a real painer.
Imagine a deaf Moscow night.
The neighbors below, as always by nightfall, are waking up and starting to feel mean, but very loudly yelling at each other.
And it's threatening to move furniture.
There's no time to go to the market in the kitchen to buy, like a new one asked for.
The TV schedule doesn't make any sense, so it just kept the Match, the First Channel, and, by the way, the Russia -- it almost makes no sense.
"Russia" is the family of repetitions, the whole sport there for a reason.
There's a live broadcast of the show.
Hope, of course, at Match, a young man screamed in news shows all night, first about the great semifinal of Deriglaz-Shanaev, then the coming battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, basketball is the U.S.-Australia.
I can't say anything wrong with that decision, by the way.
The Australians were equal, the first half was won at all.
They've taken the place of the awesomes of their own greatness.
As a result, they lost, but it is now said that the basketball tournament will no longer be the last.
It's all good, but the fight with DiFranchisky is coming, and the screen doesn't change.
I'm going to start writing channels in a little panic.
That's the feeling, the second time they're spinning.
All right, let's go deep, on cable.
There's no cat fencing on any of them.
Ah, I feel like the fight is about to begin.
Text and tweeting some sports websites don't suit me.
The cruise surfing gives an unexpected but brilliant result.
The "First" website is broadcast directly to all the competitions that are taking place at that time.
I'm calling fencing, I'm getting one for gold.
Deriglasov is perfectly counterattacked, moving forward at the points -- and clearly it's starting to take time.
The Italian woman is playing almost the whole stretch.
Ours on one point ahead, just over two seconds.
Di Francesca throws herself at Deriglasov, and then retreats, and the time ends, and the Italian woman takes the shot.
Victory!
A few seconds later, the Olympic Messenger on the phone reports a fourth gold medal.
It turns out I'm the first person to see it with my own eyes.
The foolish, the faithful, the interested.
The spiritual administration of the Muslim (MUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the DUM prisoner committed his imams to preach Friday only in Tatar, to force young Tatars to learn their native language.
In management, it is said that it “in no way violates” the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazani stated that the Tatar language was not understood by up to 60% of the foreigners, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves.
Imams fear that their sermons in Tatar "will not reach the entire audience."
Yesterday, the Ph.D.U. of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday’s sermons in the Republic mosques only in Tatar language.
As Tatarstan’s mufti Kamil Samigullin put it, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to learn their native language.
"For those who say it was hard, in every great mosque we intend to organize the lessons of Tatar language absolutely free of charge," Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that “the decision had already entered into force” and today in all mosques the sermons “must already be in Tatar language”.
He recalled that Tatarstan’s DUM published a magazine called Shura with typical Tatar sermons.
I've got a guy who doesn't speak very well, "may be well prepared for it."
THE DUM of Tatarstan brings together more than a thousand revenue in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to Mufti, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in Tatar language in the areas.
At the same time, Kazani had previously used Russian in a number of mosques.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaev mosque, Zakabana and Eniler.
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed that the management is tasked with ensuring that all students are in possession of both State languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
“No interference of netatar Muslims can be said to be,” Mr. Muhametshin stressed, explaining that the sermon itself “is not a compulsory, essential part of the prayer”.
The prayer itself will continue to read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons in Russian will remain in mosques.
At the same time Rafik Muhametshiin said "U" that there was no serious threat of the removal of Tatar language from mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, he said that preaching in the Republic was not used.
The DCM decision was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress (WBC).
The head of the VKT Rinat Zakirov said, "U": "The mosque is an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language were to leave this area.
He noted that preaching only in Tatar was “the desire of the imams themselves,” but in the context of the CTC, “consider it correct”.
The “U” Imams who preached in Russian are ready to fulfill the DUM decision, but they believe that visitors will find it difficult to understand the clergy.
Both the Tatars and the Russians go to the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
They will, of course, be sad.
"We'll have to change," says Burnaev mosque Farhat Mavetdinov.
He said that preaching in Russian was closer to many Tatars, because “Russian, both in schools and in kindergarten, on the radio at first.”
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue the lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held in other days.
We rely on God.
Allah will show a way out of this situation," he concluded.
But about 60% of us don't speak Tatar.
These are Uzbeks and Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
We have a lot of foreign students coming to us: Africans, Arabs.
"So we've been in Russian for four years," says Imam.
He believes that in Tatar the sermons will “come to a narrower circle and not reach the entire audience”.
But we will obey the decision of the plenary.
It's just that the result of the sermons is going to be different.
But time will tell.
"I, for example, will only be easier because the Tatar language is my own," Gabdulla Galiullin concluded.
Former FSEIN Director was brought to trial
Moscow's Public Prosecutor's Office approved the indictment for the criminal case of the SCR investigated by the FSIN of the Russian Federation on the theft of the budget allocated to the needs of the Russian FSIN.
The ex-head of the prison will be brought before the court by Alexander Reimer and his deputy, who caused FSYN damage of more than 2.7 billion rubles.
The D.A. sent a criminal case against former Russian director Alexander Reimer, former Deputy Nikolay Krivolapov, and the Director of the FGUP "Information Technology and Liaison Centre of the Federal Criminal Enforcement Service" (FGUP TITHOS) Viktor Odelaynov.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are accused by the SAC on Moscow at 3 p.m. 285 of the Criminal Code (abuse of official authority with grave consequences), No. 4 p. 159 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Moscow (the fraud committed through its official position in an organized group, in a particularly large amount).
In addition, the Krivolapes are accused of an offence of article 222 of the Criminal Code (unlawful acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the CDC version, in 2010-2012, these persons were fraudulently dispossessed from the State Treasury by the budget allocated to FIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for persons under control, so-called electronic bracelets.
In order to steal budget money, the group has developed a scheme whereby the TITOS FSU under its control, with which the relevant public contracts have been concluded, has produced technical controls and oversight, including electronic bracelets, and has been implemented at prices which are overestimated several times.
Despite the absence of manufacturing equipment, buildings, and facilities for the installation of production facilities to create the completed cycle of production of electronic bracelets, five goscontrakts of more than 3.3 billion roubles were concluded between CITOS and FSIN Russia.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubles were found in the Samar branch accounts, of which 1.2 billion were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubies of cash recovered were received personally by Mr. Reimer in his office by one of the accomplices whose criminal proceedings were assigned to separate proceedings.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who participated in the machinations, found an unknown source of the bullet to the prize gun, allowing him to face further charges.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, FSIN filed a claim for damages of 2.7 billion rubies.
Football player Hakan Shukura is suspected of involvement with the Sage.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former football player and then a member of the parliament of Hakan Shukjur and searched his family's two houses.
The Turkish Football Star of the 1990s, the early 2000s, attacking Hakan Shukur, is being sought by the authorities of the country for an attempt at a coup d'état last month.
Forward, who finished his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an “armed terrorist group”.
It is the Hismet movement, a society associated with a prominent Turkish religious official and oppositionist Fethullah Gulen.
It is his President, Erdogan, who considers him to be the organizer of an attempt at a military coup on 15 July.
Fethullah Gulen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media, a warrant for the arrest of Hakan Shukur was issued today, police have already conducted searches in two houses owned by the former football player's family.
In addition to Hakan Shukur himself, his father joined the organization of Fethullah Gulen.
However, neither the former football player nor his loved ones found themselves there.
Now he and his family live in the United States.
In his life as a football player, Hakan Shukjur protected the colors of several Turkish clubs and advocated for a compulsive country.
He spent most of his career at Galatasare.
The list of foreign clubs includes the Italian Torino, Inter and Palermo, as well as the English Blackburn.
True, he did not spend more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shukur remains Turkey's most successful attack force: 112 matches for the national team and 51 scored.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur left his post because of an ongoing corruption investigation around the Erdogana party and its immediate environment.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, an arrest warrant of at least 42 journalists was issued in Turkey on 25 July.
They are accused of promoting military coup and ties with opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States.
Given the gravity of the charges, media officers can wait for long prison terms, from ten years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovski wants to create a network of cinemas only for national films.
“I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinemas, which cost 2-3 times less than for films of foreign production”, he said.
Mr. Konchalovski noted that Russian films were difficult to compete for the viewer with the major Hollywood tapes.
We have over 100 paintings per year in the country, of which an average of 20-25 ribbons reach the screens.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with the Transformers and the Iron Man, who have huge budgets to move forward," said the film director.
Remember, on 1 July, the All-Russian Youth Education Forum “Tavrida” began its work in Crimea.
Among the participants are creative teachers and young professionals from various creative and humanitarian fields from all over Russia and from a number of countries abroad.

Uh-News - The new generator promises to give Zenit Arena by 26 December.
A new football champion in St. Petersburg, a stadium to be adopted by the Cup of Confederates 2017 and the World Cup 2018 champion, Metrostroy promises to give the arena by 26 December, reports RIA Novosti, referring to the head of the interim commission of the Federation Council for the preparations for the 2018 World Cup Championship of Football, Vadim Tulpanov.
"Today, with Russian Minister of Sports Vitaliy Mutko, we visited the building, with us was Metrostroya Director Vadim Alexandrov.
He said he'd have the stadium by 26 December.
It's a serious St. Petersburg company, it never breaks a deadline.
Vitali Mutko and I have remained satisfied with our eyes and ears," the interviewer's agency quoted it as saying.
Vitaly Mutko had previously arrived in St. Petersburg to inspect the venue for the upcoming large-scale competitions.
Mr. Tulpanov also noted that the Sofed commission he headed would continue to monitor the progress of construction of the stadium and would regularly visit the building.
Remember, yesterday it was known that Metrostroy would complete the construction of Zenit Arena, the contract cost would be about 5.4 billion rubes. The same company won a tender for the improvement of the territory around the stadium, the cost of the contract would be 2.4 billion rubies. Contracts with AO Corporation Transistra, OOO Engineering Corporation Transistra and AO Engineering Corporation Transistra were terminated.
Two other companies were not allowed to fight for the construction of the stadium.
For more details on the selection of the new contractor, see the "U" material "Metrostroma" released on the field."
In Miassa, Chelibin district, a former Deputy Governor-General, Sandakov, Konstantin Akulic, was detained.
As reported by the U-South Ural by another defendant's lawyer, Sergei Kolosovski, Constantine Akulica, was summoned to the Mias SAC Investigation Department today to bring charges against an annual statute of beatings.
At that time, Constantine Akulic moved to the scene as a lawyer to assist one of his participants.
“It was deliberately initiated against unspecified persons, and now that he started protecting Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out that it was Akulic,” says Sergei Kolosovski.
Konstantin Akulic became an ex-governer's lawyer in early August.
However, half an hour before the defence counsel's call to the CDC, the defence party was informed that Monday was due to receive information on the fraud case in which Nikolai Sandakov was charged.
In the case of Nikolai Sandakov, two criminal cases have been initiated.
As part of the first (the fraud case), he is subject to a 1.5 million rubles incriminating the pledge to promote the appointment of Mayor Magnitogorska head of the Lake Evgenia Tarasov Administration.
The second criminal case concerns the bribe that Nikolay Sandakov allegedly received from the Director of the PIP, Igor Kalugin, in the form of illegal grant of property services, at least 1.3 million rubs.
Read more about Mr. Sandakov's case in the material "U" "The former vice-governor requires the consolidation of his affairs".
The Russian copper company (RMC) is ready to assume social responsibility and to pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMC was committed to modernizing one of the oldest and most environmentally friendly facilities in the Karabash Medical Union.
The Karabash Medical Company was founded by an English Shareholder Society led by Leslie Urkwart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was an industrial enterprise that was relevant to the country ' s economy, and it actually ensured the viability of the entire city.
However, in the 1990s, owing to financial problems, production was stopped, resulting in serious social problems in Karabasha.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabash Medical Unit.
There was also a need to address one of the main problems of the Karabash factory - environmental.
By the beginning of the 2000s, Karabash had already been known sadly as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation in Karabasmedi began to change in 2004, after the enterprise was transferred to the Russian copper company.
The company began to upgrade its production, gradually reducing the environmental burden.
This was recently noted by Governor Boris Dubrovsky of Chelyabin Region, who visited Karabaszmed in the first few July.
The head of the South Ural described the enormous changes that had taken place with the enterprise since Karabas bear moved to the RMC group.
The main activity for the modernization of Karabasmeda in recent years has been the construction of a new sercosilage plant, allowing the capture of up to 99.9 per cent of scrap metal.
According to the president of the Russian copper company, the investment in the project was around 7 billion rubes.
The next stage of the modernization of the Karabas bear ZA is the reconstruction of the conversion gear.
The replacement of three converters, dusters, gas tracts is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016 it is planned to launch a new 1 billion rubles industrial waste treatment plant.
In turn, there will be an increase in the amount of taxes paid to the city of Karabas.
During the entire period of implementation of the Tominski Goqa project, from the beginning of construction and before the implementation of the second round, the Federal Treasury will receive 8.9 billion rubies.
Following the introduction of the GOC, tax revenues at all levels can be 80.9 billion roubles.
During the year of production in the Varna region, there are 346.3 million roubles in various budgets.
And that's in the first year.
“The longer the business works, the more the deductions can be,” added Valeri Ulanovski.
In the RMC, it was clarified that in 2015 tax returns from the Miheiev GOQ were close to 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of PMC enterprises in the lives and development of their territories is not limited to tax deductions.
The companies of the RMC help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, build cultural and entertainment facilities, and support the territory.
In 2016, a major social project of the Russian copper company in Karabaš became major repairs and, in fact, almost complete restructuring of the N9 kindergarten into 95 educators.
The building, built in 1960, was in an emergency condition.
There will also be a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and ground-floor parking spaces for 600 car parks, cafes and sports shops.
The Armour of the Arena will allow for well-known professional sporting events at the international level.
But the main objective of this project is to make exercise and sports available to the people of Chelyabinsk, especially children.

The staff of the Sandholm Refugee Centre in Denmark suspected that the adolescents living there were engaged in prostitution.
On Thursday, 11 August, reports The Local.
According to him, some teenagers told the agency that “someone in Copenhagen organizes prostitution”.
According to the publication, the doubts of the shelter workers arose after the Swedish newspaper Sydsvenkan told about similar stories in Malmö.
In 2015, a crisis erupted in the European Union due to the influx of refugees from Africa and the Middle East.
Denmark has placed more than 20,000 of them on its territory.
A fisherman caught a rare blue lobster off the coast of Cape Code, U.S.A.
The man found cancer among the others caught in his underwater trap, reports ABC News.
The American plans to transfer it to the local oceanrium.
Lobster weighs about two pounds.
It is noted that Wayne Nickerson has been hunting lobbyists for the last 35 years.
According to his wife, for the first time in his career a man was caught by a blue lobster in 1990.
According to ABC News, crustaceans acquire blue or blue decoration as a result of genetic changes.
In April 2016, fishermen fished off the coast of Japan for the rarest species of deep sea sharks, Megachasma pelagios (majority shark).
A five-meter animal weighs about a ton.
The Black Sea Navy military carried out the work on the Black Sea water-diversity defence.
RIA Novosti was informed by the representative of the Ministry of Defence Press Office on the Igor Digalo Navy.
The training was carried out in the first phase of exercises on special types of enforcement of the forces of the IMF.
“Military personnel of the anti-ship-diversation units have completed the anti-ship-diversation defence of the fleet site on the coast and adjacent sea area of the Black Sea,” said Digalo.
About 400 troops participated in the exercises, more than 10 military equipment units, including Mi-8 and Ka-27 helicopters, the Grzecznok anti-diversion boats and the Raptor speedboats.
During the manoeuvres of the forces of armoured vessels using hydroacoustic means, conditional diverting groups were found and the attack by sea of "sub-sea divertors" on the CF-based site was reflected.
From the helicopter Ka-27, an anti-aircraft group landed, which blocked and destroyed the divertors of the conditional opponent.

The retiree has turned the stallion into a "budget beachtop."
The users of the network laughed at the photographs that the elderly man had set up on the beach with a swing and turned it into a water jumper.

However, one of the commentators on the Pikabu portal pointed out that it was impossible to judge the depth of the sea in the image.
“First, we don’t know what the depth of the beach can be, the beach can be bulky with a sharp descent per meter right outside the staircase, and secondly, even if there is a meter of depth, if you can jump from a few meters,” said the user under no one C0JIBAMDJZ

In 2006, he unlawfully ordered the acquisition of a city of a road bridge through the Chigiri River, at an excessive cost without competitive procedures and the conclusion of a municipal contract, explains Interfax.
In addition, between 2007 and 2010, Migraine, in favour of a controlled business organization, changed the time-limits for payments under a contract for the sale of a lease contract for a land plot that was provided for the construction of a dwelling and also released the rental company.
As a result, more than 5 million roubles were missing in the area, and some 21 million roubles had been executed by the city.

The explosions in Thailand's resorts are “local sabotage acts” and are not related to the activities of international terrorists.
According to Reuters, the Thai police said so.
According to the detention, they have not yet been able to determine whether these explosions are related.
According to the main version, their planners tried to disrupt the tourist season.

Messengers and postal service owners must identify users and remove prohibited information - such is the brief content of a bill developed by the Media and Communications Union (ISS) that brings together the largest Russian telecommunications operators (as part of the News).
The members of the three Union companies confirmed that such a project was under discussion.
At the beginning of autumn, he should be represented to a working group under the leadership of First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Šovalova, says the interlocutor “The News” at the ISS.
These are amendments to the Communications and Media Laws.
They provide that any “organizer for the dissemination of information on the Internet providing for the exchange of electronic communications” is obliged to identify users on the basis of the information contained in the databases of communications operators by pre-contracting with them.
Also “to immediately block communications or publications that contain information that violates the requirements of Russian law”.

WSJ: The US is considering imposing sanctions against the RF because of the break-in of democratic servers.
U.S. officials are considering introducing new sanctions against Russia in response to the break-in by the Democratic Party's servers, writes The Wall Street Journal, referring to sources.
In order to impose sanctions, the U.S. President Barack Obama is said to be formally accused of attacking Russia's servers or being supported by the Russian authorities of hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other U.S. Special Forces are virtually confident of Russia's involvement in cyberattack.
WSJ notes that the US usually prefers not to mention those who carry out hacker attacks.
The exception is a data breach made in 2014 by Sony Entertainment Pictures, which was officially entrusted to the DPRK.
However, last year, Obama issued a decree simplifying the procedure for the imposition of sanctions on those implementing or contributing to cyber attacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be prolonged, the publication shall be written.
Even if officials had concluded that hackers had acted with Russian support, they would have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose the information.
They need to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
It was previously reported that the Barack Obama administration allowed sanctions against a State whose hackers had broken into the servers of the Democratic Party ' s Naccomodity.
The WikiLeaks website has published an electronic correspondence of the national committee of Democrats.
The media reported that hackers working with Russian authorities could be involved in a break-in.
In the Kremlin, these reports were called absurd.
FAS strikes Google almost half a billion roubles
The result was a breach of competition in the mobile application market.
The anti-monopoly trial was initiated at the initiative of the I index.
The Russian company argued that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited the prevention of applications from other developers, in particular the Jap Index.
FAS found evidence to these claims and found that the company abused the dominant position on the market and forced mobile device manufacturers to install with Google Play other applications.
Following the verification, the Federal Anti-monopoly Service decided to punish Google and informed the head of the FAS Alexey Docentenko.
The fine shall be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
In FAS, it was concluded that the competition law must be respected by all companies, including transnational corporations.
Google, in turn, intends to examine the solution first and only then determine with further action: perform it or challenge it.
The Federal Anti-monopoly Service recognized the company as a breacher of the competition law last September and ordered that the contracts be adjusted by 18 December.
However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the department have been conducting trials.
In the FAS, it was noted that despite the fine, the possibility of a world agreement was discussed with Google.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This view was expressed by the lead analyst, Ehu Moscow, by Eldar Murtazin, Mobile Research Group.
Murtazine also noted that the fine would have no effect on users or on the competitiveness of the corporation.
The enemy rented an apartment and then stole 84,000 roubles.
The stolen household equipment was sold by a 30-year-old robber.
As reported by MC correspondent Volgograd in the Russian Regional Ministry of Public Health press service, a resident of a satellite city made an application to the Volzsky Police Department earlier.
The man told the enforcers of the law that the unknown had taken down his apartment.
When the householder visited his home, he found it completely empty — not a washing machine, a TV, a refrigerator, or an apartmenter.
The total damage amounted to 84,000 roubles.
Soon the guards of the order came after the thief.
They turned out to be a 30-year-old unemployed witch.
The man was detained, and he gave a confession, stating that the stolen property had already been sold.
He will now have to answer for the theft throughout the law - criminal proceedings against the detainee.
This year, the criminal will be notified of the payment of the transport tax.
The inhabitants of the peninsula will now pay taxes on land, property and transportation.
The head of the Federal Tax Service Office for the RC, Roman Nasdrachev, made this statement at a press conference.
By the end of 2016, criminal car owners will be notified of the payment of the transport tax.
So far, the tax bill has accounted for about 250,000 people who own motor vehicles.
Taxpayers' data will be provided by GIBDD, Rossreister.
“If, as of 1 January, we receive information about real estate owners and landowners, the next year Crimea citizens will be tax payers” said Roman Nastrachev.
Allowances for property taxes will be granted to concessional categories of citizens, particularly those of retirees.
There is also a tax-based system of deductions depending on the concessionary category of taxpayer, but according to the UFNS head, it is early until 2017.

The effect of "Anime" Snapchat has been criticized as a cartoon of Asians
Snapchat states that this filter is inspired by animum, but some observers say it is racially intact.
The Snapchat tool allows about 150 million users to change reality on a day and play with individuality ways that limit absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character to be the painting of Roy Liechtenstein.
Lenses are rough, warping features of instruments that create more than 30 million modified self-helps a day.
Any errors quickly become common knowledge.
Snapchat lenses were criticized in the past when they were accused that the app advertised a dark face or encouraged bleached faces as ideal beauty.
So when some users this week offered a lens that provided them with hairy eyes, curved teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics thought it was racist cartoons on Asians — "jeltolics".
And they wondered whether these repeated contradictions indicated the more serious problem of a company of diversity.
Reports were circulated on Wednesday and followed by anger in reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat said it had been removed.
The company commented: the lens was designed as a tribute to anime characters, not as a cartoon of Asians.
But experts who know about racism are not surprised, Linza recalled offensive stereotypes in action.
Others totally rejected the anime comparison.
In an electronic letter from Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about photographs were actively shared, she said that the lens was "insulting and at least awkward".
She added that “it was difficult to argue with the comparison of the side to the very rough cartoon of the Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just a jaundice, but a highly destructive jaundice.
Snapchat is not the only company through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the deways we all carry.
And the vast audience of young people in Snapchat, who are more racially diverse than their older generation, may mean that they are more likely to have an understanding.
When one of the Snapchat lenses creates an image offensive to the user, then, she said in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Kathy Joo, "it's much more difficult to stay unnoticed than it was before."
On Thursday, Jou, the production manager and engineer who works for the Medium, decided to remove her record in Snapchat and urged others to do the same.
In an article for the Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that racial contradictions were the cause of insufficient diversity in recruitment in Snepchat.
I have been criticized mainly by the white management of a company composed solely of men and finished my article with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu, who herself is an American of Chinese origin, wrote: “For there were not enough white people in the state who could make such decisions, or who work white people, but who do not have positions where they can speak safely and openly.”
Other observers share her point of view by expressing dissatisfaction at the fact that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, stressing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but according to the confidant, the company had recently recruited a recruiter to focus on the underrepresented population and on active efforts to involve domestic resources.
For her part, Jo said that she would keep her record in Snapchat closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us so that they can say they can't do that."
Military leadership distorts IGIL intelligence, reports to Congress Commission
The U.S. Central Command officials modified intelligence reports to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than on the ground, the congressional commission reported in a report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group established by the Republican chairpersons of the Chamber of Representatives ' Committee for the Navy, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Military Appropriations found “widespread dissatisfaction” among intelligence analysts of the Central Command Service, who claim that their leaders have followed up on their assessment of American actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military office in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence documents approved by Centcom's high command tended to give a more optimistic picture of United States anti-terrorist actions than evidenced from the scene of events and were more optimistic than the analysis provided by other special forces,” said the report.
“What happened at Centcoma is unacceptable: when a top-level analysis is presented, our military is affected,” said a member of the House of Representatives, Ken Calvert, a republican from California.
The management problems in Centcom are at the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report examines in detail the shortcomings that have arisen in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of United States actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain final evidence that Obama management has been ordered to falsify the reports, he argues that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership forced them to give a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony from the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than real events”, the report reported.
For example, Centcoma official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could start in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
“After months of investigation, it is known for sure,” said a member of the House of Representatives, Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas.
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, the highest management of the US Central Command Intelligence Service forged command intelligence to reduce the threat posed by IGIL in Iraq.
The Republicans established an operational group when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that the Islamic State intelligence had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the data published on Thursday will be more distorted.
An additional, pending investigation into Centcom intelligence is being carried out by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Representatives of the democratic party in the Intelligence Committee of the US Congress Chamber of Representatives published their own data on Thursday, consistent with some of the findings of the Republic's operational group.
“During 2014 and 2015, Centcom established an excessively closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments concerning IGIL and Iraqi security forces,” said a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, the main representative of the democratic party on the committee.
The procedure, according to Schiff, “stopped the release of intelligence documents”, damaged the moral state of analysts and “not sufficiently reflected divergent views”.
But Schiff and the Democrats argue that they found no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom analysts to bring their findings up to the “appointed or political interpretation”.
Preliminary results of the Congress ' s inquiry were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by Chief Inspector Pentagon, opened after a complaint by analysts from Centcom.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress report as the investigation of the Chief Inspector continued.
But he said that “experts sometimes differ in the treatment of integrated data, and the departments and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital subjects relating to national security”.
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the objectives of the American-led bombing in Iraq and Syria (as now claimed by more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year ' s statements raise doubts as to whether President Obama can rely on Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis sites.
The criticism of the Islamic State intelligence repeats the disputes that took place more than ten years ago when an intelligence analyst from Centcom Gregory Hooker wrote a study article claiming that President George Walker Bush's administration protested a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think of what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest caused by intelligence in the Islamic State.
Last year, officials said that Huker's team found that despite public claims to the contrary, oil tankers belonging to the Islamic State had not significantly deteriorated the financial situation of the terrorist group, because it had built temporary oil plants to sell oil on the black market.
But the opening was not distributed outside the Central Command, according to the Times newspaper in September.
The then commander of Centcoma, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after the testimony in the Senate, which many deputies considered an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel in Central Command.
The United States beats 4 consecutive matches in women's grass hockey, thus approaching a decisive match with Britain
The once dead three goals in a match, which ended in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Kathy Beam opened the account on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's grass hockey team, when Americans won the Indian team with a 3-0 bill.
Five heads in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, who is 27 years old, says that she is not sure if she would ever do something like that.
"I won't put my mind to it," she said.
I'm not really the kind of people who track their goals.
This is what she knows: America's 4-0 account in the Olympic tournament, and they compete first in their group with Britain, which remains invincible after Japan's 2-0 game on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams claim to be a quarterfinal, and the result of the game will be who will take first place in their group of six teams and who will be the second.
The winner will avoid meeting with a strong team of Dutch rivals, leaders of another group, a little weather when the quarterfinal games begin.
The Saturday game, however, shows that the Americans here made a noise with their unexpected series four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams in the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time, she took a hockey stick on her lawn when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters were playing this kind of sport in Drexel), and she joined the 16-year-old national teammate, becoming the youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she didn't have a finals tour.
Then came 2012, when she and her teammates did not have everything.
The following year, Coig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and it all began to change.
“Cultural change, psychological change, physical change,” said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the kind of productivity we have right now.
We've changed our minds completely.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the first half of the game with a bumpy hand at a short distance.
India came to the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team proved to be surprisingly tough and maintained the 1-0 account until the end of the third period when Bam took the initiative in her own hands.
It took a long passage down the left side of the field, then went into the middle of the spiral and abruptly sent the ball to the gate, thus giving the Americans an advantage of 2-0.
Melissa González added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The victory was the first for the US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs to score one goal in each of the first three victories.
She's in shock.
So is Bam.
“We’re in a good place right now,” said Parnham, “but how good it depends on the result of Saturday’s game.
In the midst of the impoverishment of the Olympic Games - the day of the Battoon Jumps
Wherever you are, whatever time it is now, it's the Olympics.
Developments in Rio de Janeiro seem constant and inevitable, a combination of competition and desire.
It's like the Olympic fire itself, and there's this hot torch that's passed from the arch to the swimmer, to the gymnast, to the triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors on the line at the cafe, and don't hear about Simone Bailes, Katie Ledecki, or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first to participate in the Olympic Games, a beauty with dimples on his cheeks, could well be among those celebrities who are shown in the Prime Time, which are promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencing.
But a 28-year-old Dooley from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic Battoons.
The Olympics do not share the same light.
Further than the center, partly in the shadows, there are those types of sport that are not generally recognized: the shooting of a pneumatic gun, the shooting of bows, the badminton, the Thakwondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I'm allowed to speak out in defense of my personal passion, allow me to draw your attention to the humble love of the storks.
Although the Batouth jumps have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at the Sydney Games, they have received so little recognition over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed have not been aware that they are even part of the Olympic sport.
This could be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States even sent athletes to the competitions, they never won medals on the top of their shoes, and their athletes did not go to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russian generally share male awards and Chinese and Canadian women.
Dun Dun from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But the baton jumps have an outsider’s charm, especially because the uninformed ear is more associated with the circus college than with the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just a ground-down enthusiast.
Indeed, they have a comical potential — a cartoon of endless jumps — but also the beauty of gymnastics and jumps in the water, the two types of sport that they mostly combine.
The word "butut" is derived from the Spanish word "el trampolín", which means "tamplin for water jumps".
The winners jump on a giant bat, taking up almost 30 feet in the air, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, folds and flips) before final landing.
They are assessed by the performance, complexity and “times of flight”, according to the official Olympics programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is ahead.
The candidates for the medal should go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to finish, and sometimes to the rear and forward, to the field.
They seek not only the finish line or the start wall, but also, in view of the camera, another annoying abroad: the world record or the Olympic record.
It is a noble, dignified pursuit, even fanatical — and it is enough to force even the viewer to slip through.
But it, in my opinion, gets a little tired when you watch the Games.
He's got a shower on his thigh.
The direction of the Batutist is up.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she jumps, seems unconscious, like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then no effort up again.
And they are certainly not without competition or difficulties, but throughout the programme there is no crazy zeal for finishes, no jumps in length, just a strange, egregious time and gravity.
This is the closest Olympic sport to the bottom.
Women's qualifying competitions, and then the finals will take place on Friday afternoons, broadcasts per hour in Eastern European time; men on Saturdays, also during the hour.
NBC will broadcast the finals of the daily programme from 14:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can easily be seen in a common dump.
And if the growth of consciousness can only be achieved through the attention and objectivity of male athletes — as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by male gymnasts from the United States — it is only because they are waiting for their new fascinating crowd of fans.
Generation Protests in Ethiopia, U.S. longtime Ally
Zealous Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators requiring political change in Ethiopia faced a violent confrontation from the Government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally injured during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really at a crossroads?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months anti-government protests have rocked the country, expanding its territory.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have been out on the streets demanding radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s response was harsh.
Eyewitnesses claimed that police officers had shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
The video from the protest site, allegedly shot at the end of last year or early this year, shows how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands on the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
“It was always difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it would be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project in an international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country in Africa since Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and almost no country in Africa is receiving such support from the West.
Ethiopia ' s economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly — there is even a new suburban train in the capital city of Addis Ababa.
Its streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia has hardly been a model of democracy — human rights organizations have consistently referred to governmental repression - the opposition in the territory of the State has been cut off by the fact that dissidents have actually been silenced.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, murdered or exiled to remote deserts.
But that can change.
“If people are constantly suppressed and left with options other than protest, the rebellion will rise”, said Seium Teshome, a lecturer at the university in central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
The generation is protesting.
Complaints are numerous, beginning with land use, ending with government coalition power.
Following widespread criticism of last year's elections, the government party and its allies have completely overturned the opposition and now control 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are increasing; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may attempt to use unrest and re-arrange themselves.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, which have been boiling in the depth of the soul for several years, are now raging.
The first one seems to be completely harmless: smartphones.
In the past few years alone, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate in social networks, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace and Internet services have improved.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
A number of young Ethiopians said that this is how they were organized to protest.
The second is that there is greater solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries Amhara has flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in lower areas.
But it also changes.
"We will work together at the same time," said Mulata Gemec, leader of Oromo.
The major protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many of the Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is dominated unjustly by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could predict danger.
Analysts argue that he especially experienced the early signs of discontent and used investigators to obtain data and decontaminate opponents.
"The current regime lacks common sense," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalen, appeared out of nowhere and took Meles' place.
Unlike Meles, born in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Heilemariam is a Southerner.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that this will result in more bloodshed.
Ethiopia last experienced such unrest in 2005, after thousands of people protested that, according to analysts, it was likely the elections that the Government had won and then falsified.
During the ensuing repression, many Protestants were killed, although less than in the last months, and this period of unrest was relatively fast.
Development experts expressed their appreciation to the leaders of Ethiopia for the far-reaching development of infrastructure, such as the new inter-urban train and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this did not stop the rise of domestic dissatisfaction by the Ethiopian Government.
And it takes dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protestors in Gondar, the city of Amhara, attacked Tigray-owned enterprises and anti-Tigra hatred in social networks became comprehensive.
Analysts say that protesters make the United States and other Western allies uncomfortable.
The American Government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand it does not wish its ally to lose power in a already unstable region.
"It's going to be hard to get through this tight rope," Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that IGIL was founded by Obama, “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried to replace the last conflict, covering his election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when he said several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of a candidate for the presidency from the republican party to approach the American people wisely.
It also made his deputies who tried to protect him during a period of unrest awkward because they had to explain words he probably didn't mean.
In expressing this assumption at Wednesday evening's meeting, Trump strongly insisted on his statement Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the President and Clinton had founded the IGIL.
But on Twitter's post early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just on the air.
This position was a direct contrast to the claim made just the day before when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When radio conservator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump ease his speech by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy IGIL, the Republican party's candidate for president did not seize the opportunity.
The last scandal took place when Trump tried to turn his campaign into an economy against a decline in ratings.
Trump and Clinton made competing statements about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to return to this topic.
Then again, after resorting to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to an increase in taxes, and he said that his speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm as an excuse before.
At the end of July, after he became obsessed with universal criticism, almost expressing the idea that Russian should break Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his comments, saying, "Of course, I'm joking."
Such an approach allows Trump to go beyond allowed political speech and to take his words back if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing the messages that are in response to his worshipers, watching them work, and then explaining them to one side, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, the communication expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is careful in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to treat them differently.
Instead of mitigating statements for a broad electorate, Trump took an even more violent tone in the last days, while his ratings continued to decline.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed that Trump is giving way to Clinton with a large bulkhead in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and taking her to Florida.
Although Trump usually tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and not understanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump has been the focus of the presidential campaign in recent months, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an awkward position: they must publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolf U. Juliani, former mayor of New York, who is one of Trump's most famous deputies, made serious efforts to protect the interview candidate, the CNN, on Thursday.
“I think what he says is an acceptable political comment,” said Juliani, when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It's true in the sense that before Obama IGIL was almost an unknown tiny organization, he called it an unpresentative threat, absolutely unfair, and that's why it happened because he brought troops out of Iraq.
Most of the average Republicans believe that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, has allowed IGIL to develop because she was unable to handle the situation in the Middle East.
Before a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for the use of his every word and his bias towards him.
He made fun of the "poor poor" TV experts who tried to figure it out and said, "They are weak."
Some Democrats ridiculed Trump's excuses as a mere confirmation that he did not belong with the presidents.
Sometimes a crowded coffee shop goes back to Greenpoint.
Werb's coffee shop was packed with only cash in Williamsberg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but was served with good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was pushed out of her room with a window on Bedford Avenue.
Soup Sheri magazine, which took place in Werb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in the new city.
"New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB's dead, Chelsea's hotel destroyed, and Verbe's now a soap shop."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is being updated.
Werb's restored coffeehouse opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and credit cards, but there are some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere.
Also, coffee is still good.
The head of the new Verba is Sisko Rodriguez, an old coffee shop official who owns the general manager in a new location.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to offer it in a new place, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, who was 36, left much behind.
Werb works with the same bagel distributor and bought the same coffee machine model.
It even sets the mirrors from the old Verba.
But Rodríguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu offers bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches and has capers or roasted onions.
There's a turquoise dish.
They don't serve beer at the coffee shop anymore, but they're making fresh juices now.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said that he had drawn attention to the constant flow of old permanent clients.
"Many former clients were also priced from Williamsberg," he said.
In one recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of such clients.
Oliveira, aged 34, lived in Williamsberg and visited Verbe often.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she went there anyway.
After the "Verba" closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was the coffee and atmosphere that impressed me at Verba," she said.
Now she's having her coffee again, although that day instead of regular ice coffee, she ordered some tea, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has visited Verbe loyally since 2003.
He went to work and ordered the same thing over and over again.
"At fifteen minutes of the eighth, every day, as I was in the morning, I came and my bagel was made for me with butter and all the bowls," he said.
Rodríguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes on the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes a simple order, but sometimes he changes something with bacon, eggs or cheese on a bagel with all the bowls.
Rodríguez said he wasn't offended that the soap shop had once taken over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soup Sherry offered to make a special soap for Verba using coffee made in cold fashion as an ingredient.
"I think we may agree to their offer," said Rodriguez.
The permanent residents of Greenpoint Polish origin also loved the coffee shop.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the window to make his new neighbors feel desired.
There are other benefits to the new place.
The local juice point plans to spill on bottles and sell coffee in a cold way.
There is a chance that the coffee shop will join the next building.
For many clients, the new Verb will include their favorite dishes on the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client and shared that he was killed in grief when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened up in a new place, Whitt said that when he went inside and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he was coming home.
“How long I wanted to feel this scent”, he admitted.
Depressive Foods of Depression in The Plate
In March 1933, shortly after rising to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved fashion dishes on Fifth Avenue, such as fua-gra and Meryland turtle soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and pastry pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
Husbands living in Brooklyn Heights are food history specialists.
The last book of Koua, Ragu in Chinese, was devoted to Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of life in a rented apartment in the Lower East Side through food in her book "House 97 of Fruit Garden."
Their new joint work “Floor Tablet”, to be published Tuesday by Harper, is the history of American food in the Great Depression.
In some respects, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny restaurant in Flatairyron Square, which has been operating since 1929, the year of the Birgid crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and a sandwich with a piece of olives, and Coe, 57, took a turkey, a mashed potatoes and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roulette, the couple considered it a suitable starting point to discuss food in the Depression era.
"The roulettes were of great demand," said Siegelman.
There was a peanut roulette, a liver roulette, a bean roulette.
They were made from a primary ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to grow.
Imagine eating as much peanut as you need for dinner.
Koo splintered.
“It must have been a stone in his stomach,” he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, represented the Swedish table.
A group of women prepared for farm men, and a freshly cooked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. The plate describes how the country managed to stop being a land of plenty.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult subject for Americans," Ko said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
A new budget diet was equally difficult: mysterious dishes, such as roulettes and roasts, have become the main food products; baking is “a wonderful way to dispose of dishes, ” said Siegelman, “because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
For many years, the former basis for American food has become an economical luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary healthy meaning.
In research on a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of that era: a baked onion stuffed with peanut oil.
“This supplement to the lunch table has not been successful,” said Ko.
Siegelman added, "That was very strange."
Peanut oil does not fit the roasted onion.
This has been characteristic of many household recipes.
More than ever before, household experts — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Office from 1923 to 1943 — managed the country’s food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become budget makers, to accept the challenge, and to turn a burrito like carrotd spaghetti into delicious dishes.
"Plain Tablet" is a glimmer of curious historical facts.
Especially spicy stories about the Government's reaction to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Guver's position in the spirit of “let go of pies”.
Publicly transporting the simple farming scrape of Iowa’s time of childhood, he ate like the subtle millionaire he had become.
“ He liked continental cuisine, for example, fish with cucumber sauce, ” said Coe.
He ate practically in a gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically alienated from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economy that had no interest in taste, and that led to the White House 'using not only the most boring food in Washington but sometimes the most disgustingly prepared.'
Many of the culinary receptions of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country was back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrients, says Siegelman, and how science has been used in cooking.
The husbands tell us that when writing the book, they understood better the eating habits of the mother of Siegelman — that she could not throw out food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of being careless about eating," Ko said.
Siegelman remembers, "She poisoned people on a totally serious scale."
There was an unpleasant case of profiteers.
When the dishes at Eisenberg's dropped off, they and Coe got dessert, which they prepared at home: a blackberry dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
“It’s called a muss from a blackberry, ” said Siegelman, adding that it was a widespread reception, giving modest recipes the bros ’ names.
There were no beaten plums, only blackness, a little torment, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone was reluctant to place a spoon in a thick, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was good.
Ko asked for supplements twice.
He said to his wife by the voice of a confident budget maker, "A few roubles of Greek nuts would not be in the way of this."
The arrest of the figures of the mass fighting case at the Havana Cemetery was extended until 14 November
Until 14 November, the Fresh Court detained figures on the mass fighting case at the Hován Cemetery, granting the relevant application of the investigation.
In the case of accused persons, there are 14 persons.
We recall that on 14 May, a massacre of several hundred Middle Asian and North Caucasus civilians took place at the Hován Cemetery, which killed three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Yuri Chabuev and the lawyer, the co-founder of the Public Organization, Alexander Bocharnikov, has been charged with organizing the killing.
The question of the second indexation of pensions for 2016 can be resolved within the next two or three weeks.
On 12 August, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Olga Golodec reported on this during a visit to the Brjan region.
We have specific parameters to increase our pension in order to offset the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
The economists are now taking stock of the half-years, and we will finish this work within the next two or three weeks," Golodec quoted Interfax as saying.
Commenting on the strategic development plan proposed by the head of the Centre for Strategic Development, Alexei Kudra, for six months each year, the vice-premier reported that the subject was not addressed in the Cabinet.
In late July, it became known that the Government had agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Stone and Grigorian went to the finals of small-caliber rifle competitions.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamensky and Kiril Grigorian went to the finals of small-caliber rifle shooting competitions in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and took first place is a new Olympic record in qualification.
Cyril Grigorian became the second - 628.9.
Eight of the best athletes went to the finals.
Kamensky is a world record player in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gulen demands an international investigation into the circumstances of Turkey ' s coup d ' état.
“I demand that an independent international commission investigate an attempt at a coup d’état,” quoted the French newspaper Le Monde of Gulen.
Also, the Turkish oppositionist said that "if any part of the charges is confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gulen denies any involvement in the coup d'état, stressing that his organization had never claimed political power.
The Istanbul Court had previously arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen.
Let us recall that an attempt at military coup took place in Turkey at night from 15 to 16 July.
Gilead will reimburse the costs of legal services during the dispute over a patent from Hepatitis C with Merck
Gilead Science Inc has the right to receive reimbursement for the costs of legal services it has incurred in connection with the claim for the Hepatitis C patent with Merck & Co Inc, a federal district judge.
In June, Gilead was freed from the payment of $200 million for violation of Merck's two patents relating to the drugs of Gilead, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the American judge found a number of violations by Merck, including by oath and other unethical acts.
On Thursday, U.S. Federal District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead had the right to reimburse the costs incurred during the lawsuit.
Merck tries to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case occurred in 2013 when Gilead and Merck brought each other to justice, claiming their rights to laboratory work, which is the foundation of the sophosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead’s drugs.
The United States-supported armed forces claim to have taken full control of Manbage from the Islamic State
The United States-supported armed forces took full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State militants left, a group representative reported on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now clearing the city after the remaining group of fighters who have been hiding in the city.
They freed more than 2,000 civilian hostages who were detained by militants, told Reiter Sharfan Darvis of the Manbij military council's Allied SDS.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are in charge of cleaning operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax
Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax returns on Friday, showing that the presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about 5.3 million dollars in fees for statements, and the former Secretary of State declared income of $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure in the Department of State.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife, Anna Holton, issued tax declarations in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
“Hilary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set a standard of financial transparency, ” said the election councillor Clinton Jennifer Palmieri in a statement.
In total contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and violates his previous promises to publish his tax declarations.
This is a common case for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York's businessman Trump and his lawyers called the review of the State Tax Service as a reason for his refusal to publish his tax declarations.
“Your move,” said a councillor at Clinton Jan Sams Pre-election headquarters in Twitter, referring to the statements made by a candidate from a democratic party.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trump Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the test was completed.
Trump's critics, including a candidate for presidents from the republican party in 2012, Mitta Romney and other Republican compatriots, said that his refusal raised questions about his status, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton grabbed hold of this issue and released an online video on Friday that gave priority to outstanding Republicans who persuaded Trump to release tax returns.
On Thursday, she raised the issue in the context of the Michigan economy.
“He refuses to do what everyone has done without exception to the presidential candidate for decades: to make their tax declarations public,” she said to the assembly.
The Politico newspaper reported that Trump did not pay any or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business observer quoted many tax lawyers and accountants on Friday as saying that it might still be the case.
Federal tax rates were the subject of a presidential election dispute.
Clinton supported a rule named after a billionaire investor, Warren Buffett, that would ensure that people who receive more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
Meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Baffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, suggested that Trump meet and exchange tax declarations.
Baffett said he was also under IRS surveillance, and that Trump was afraid not of tax collecting agencies but of voters.
Clinton's pre-election headquarters had published tax declarations up to 2007.
The Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was a source of wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index paper fund, and Clinton declared dividends and capital income of $109,000.

Chilean powdered condoms and fireworks enhance the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Tanzania’s environmentalists use an unconventional way to prevent elephants from fertilizing into human settlements — tossing condoms filled with Chile’s powdered powder.
The method proved to be effective, and Honeyguide Foundation, which came to mind a few years ago, along with the American Committee on Nature Protection, took on its promotion by training volunteers in northern Tanzania's villages to use a non-violent, four-step approach to protecting their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday will be the World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of animals.
“Since we have invented a set of tools ..., we have observed a change in attitudes within these communities, making them much more confident that they will be able not to let elephants into their fields without harming elephants,” said Executive Director Honeyguide Damien Bell.
The first two steps are to burn the torch before the breaking elephant and to signal with a horn.
If he couldn't be intimidated, they throw away what's called a Chilean cloud.
The powder of chili mixed with the soil is placed with the baby in the condom, and its end is turned around, and only the fuse is left outside.
When the condoms are ignited, the peat is peeled, spraying a small dust dust of chili in the air.
One dun is usually enough to deploy the elephant to the other side.
The ultimate measure is a launching device that shoots Roman candles in the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Thirty-two Turkish diplomats had not yet returned to Turkey, who had left the country after the coup d ' état in July.
Such data was provided by the head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mewlut Chavuchoglu in a conversation with local journalists.
In the first phase, we called off 208 human resources diplomats to continue their work at the centre.
Of these, 32 people did not return without objective reasons and explanations," said the head of the Turkish foreign policy office.
Let us recall that a coup attempt took place in July in Turkey.
The authorities have officially declared that the coup has failed, as well as the detention of over 6,000 persons, among them military acts of the highest and middle rank.
As a result of attempts at a coup d'état, 290 people were killed, according to the Turkish MID.
Jewish director sharply criticized Berlin hotel for removing Israeli telephone code at the request of Arabs, reported to RT News channel
The French director of Jewish origin unleashed a scandal in the media, discovering that the Campinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not appear on the list of Israeli telephone codes, while the employees referred to “requests” by Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, author of a documentary film on Holocaust Shoa, expressed his dissatisfaction with the Campinski Bristol hotel in Berlin, wrote an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lanzman Hotel, he tried to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, has not been mentioned among States where it can be called directly from the room.
In 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, how could Israel be excluded and eliminated?
He wrote Lantzman.
In return, Campinsky Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In search of an explanation, the director raised the issue at the hotel administration stand.
The answer he received there, according to Lantzman, was “stricken by him”.
Klerk Hotel said the measure was "a deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotel Network."
The reason behind this step caused even greater anger by the director.
“The majority of our guests were Arabs, and they demanded that Israel’s code be removed”, Lantzman, a hotel servant, said.
The Ambassador of Israel to Germany, James Hadas-Handelsman, called the case “a terrible disgrace, ” reports the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's really a terrible disgrace.
What happened in Germany and in this hotel network is an even greater disgrace.
There's no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," the official said.
The case was caused by a great deal of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply “went on” to the alleged demands of Arab clients.
“You would be ashamed, ” said another post stating that the hotel on the famous Kurfurstendamm street is near the synagogue.
The hotel itself rushed to rescind any charges, calling what happened "unseen" and "sorry" before Lantzman, reports the Der Spiegel newspaper.
“There was no direct order not to include Israel in the rapid recruitment list,” quoted the representative of the Campinese newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung as saying.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
The students met with the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered to protest government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to chase students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in a demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
According to São Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin ' s proposals, nearly 100 State secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be reassigned to save money.
Some protestors were seen writing on graffiti against temporarily acting President Michael Temer.
This last protest took place only a few days after the protesting crowd marched out on the streets to support the removed President Dilma Roussef when the Senate voted in favour of her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran grew by 71%, reports the RT Business portal
With the sanctions lifted, the trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, according to Ambassador Levan Jagarian of Iran.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there has been an increase in the interest of Russian firms in conducting business in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Jagarian.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016 the trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015, to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was due to the delivery of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the Ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that Russia will visit a record number of Iranian tourists this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued approximately 35,000 visas, mainly to Iranian citizens.
Iran has also entered the top 20 countries for the first time in the number of tourists visiting Russia.
We can say with confidence that last year's record of the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be beaten," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Jed, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition,” he said.
The State continues to twist its branches in the defence and industrial complex.
“systematic failure” was the reason for the dismissal of the director of the Almaz-Antay concert, the “loss of work” and “the loss of trust”.
The head of NGOs has been appointed by Gennadi Bendersky for the next three years.
Information on the dismissal of Neblystov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not give rise to widespread media resonance.
How can such silence be explained in the face of the military’s massive coup d’état?
It is likely that the RF leadership does not wish to disseminate any rumours or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This once again confirms that there are many problems in the defence and industrial complex (OPC) and the State does not wish to attract more attention from society.
The removal of Nebrádov is certainly an important development in terms of order in the industry.
The NGO Almaz is the main undertaking of the concert, which specializes in the production of marine and land-based air defences.
Almaz is currently working on the establishment of the Polyment Reddout and Morpheus ZRA, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, esmines and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia, Dmitri Kornev, believes that the dismissal of Nečavov is due to a disruption of the deadlines for the projects.
This version is most logical.
For example, the development of Morphea began in 2007 and was expected to take place in 2013.
Poliment-Redut must become the main air defence system on the newest Navy vessels.
According to the information I receive, in a few years of testing, no real success has been achieved.
The truth is, as far as I can tell, there's no clear "almaza" fault, said Corneuve.
The expert fears that a delay in entry into service may also occur with the C-500 ZRC.
The project experience has not yet been completed, but in 2016, the first complexes must join the troops.
In the Ministry of Defence, it is assured that “the work is planned and will be completed within the deadlines set”, although in 2014 the department acknowledged that there were problems with the development of the C-500.
It is extremely difficult to evaluate the professional qualities of Nemzadov, who has led the Almaz since 2011.
Kornev noted that project time-outs could be both a cause and a cause of dismissal.
In his view, it had become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in the IPC and business management plans.
The adult has received long - term orders for tens of billions of roubles, and large amounts of money are known to love silence.
As a general rule, the Directors of the defence companies withdraw from their posts at their own discretion, under a contract of agreement between the parties or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the removal took place in public, although there was no resonance.
This suggests that the leader of the Almazah may have been a top-down figure and resisted the lower-down discharges.
It appears that the State no longer intends to accept such behaviour.
It will remove those who prefer to argue with the Mino-Durn installations and fail to perform the tasks set out.
At the same time, the RF management is seeking to punish the failing managers (instincts at the Star Shipyard).
The President has personally focused on the issues of the sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military Industrial Commission and meets periodically on re-arms.
The Kremlin protects a number of PPC managers, seeking to be loyal to the directors, who will comply with the orders received above.
This is a far-reaching policy, but there are no other instruments available to the State against corruption and the lack of normal competition in the OPCA.
The situation in the defense is not catastrophic, of course, but the current geopolitical environment encourages the Kremlin to bring the armed forces into order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleaning” of managers in the PPC, the leadership of the RF is taking very successful steps to increase the professionalism of the Russian troops.
The army ' s personnel acquired new quality with the arrival of the Minister of Defence, Sergei Shoygu.
It seems that the President has adopted a famous saying, "Want for peace to prepare for war."
During the cold war, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which established the Moscow sphere of influence on the continent.
In all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked well.
This proved the lack of war on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The triumph of the Cold War resulted in the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in the “civilized world”, perhaps there is no calming corner left.
Despite the general disaster, the West refuses to speak to Russia at the level of equal partner.
In these circumstances, the only allies of our country remain the fleet and army.
The strengthening of military power will enable Moscow to better defend national interests and to enter new parts of world politics.
Scotlander Kallum Skinner runs on the finish line, making the British grab the bicycle gold
Scotlander Kallum Skinner raced to the triumph of the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night, thus protecting the British Command Trio from London in 2012.
Glasgow's 23-year-old birthday boy was the strongest Scottish friend Sir Chris Hoi made his own, and the young man proudly entered history, wandering the finish line to break out a favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed the right to an unexpected victory four years ago when Hoi claimed the right to a fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after they had modestly finished the sixth in the March World Championship in London, despite Hoi’s completion of his career.
The question between Beijing and London was replaced by a specialist from Jamie Staff.
They did just like the time Hindes showed up.
Hoi's care also created the void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crempton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was followed by British coaches, seeing the potential in Scotland, which has now been realized.
Hindez, Kenny — champions of Hoi four years ago — and Skinner set the Olympic record in skill, but the standard was exceeded by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold duel.
Hindez was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner backed it up.
The change of strategy was a large part of the transformation, where Hindez was driving for more gear to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep up.
Hoi observed from his post as an invited expert to the BBC and caught Skinner, Kenny and Hindez’s eyes when they entered the pedestal.
A 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "This is a ladder comparison."
I'm here to do everything I can and make a name for myself.
We set the Olympic record in the finals and beat the world champions.
That was amazing.
There's no better way to win.
After the London triumph in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoi, Hindez deliberately admitted to a race after a failed start.
He later gave up the comment and there was no way to appeal from British competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hendez said, "I felt like I was in London with all those British flags on the stands."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We played so many races with the world name that winning the Olympics was amazing again.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country, which won seven out of 10 named races in Beijing and London.
If this is the barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the bicycles are waiting for another five successful days.
With Kenny's form, it's not beyond his ability to imagine how he repeats Hoia's feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in one game.
This would allow you to see Kenny, who was born on March 23, exactly 12 years old, Hoya, who also appears to be a sacred date in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Roger Bannister, as well as six gold medals and one silver.
It would also be like Hoya's.
The next time Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and is played for three days.
A 28-year-old man from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it right now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You're coming to win with your friends.
It's a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hendes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
It was the only day of playing medals, but it was the next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke, and Owen Doll are qualified as the fastest four-mile-long pursuit race of four.
They finished for 3:51,943.
The world record for winning gold in London 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will be held today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will be precisely at the centre of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, before the qualifying agency, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
At an appropriate women's event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Russell Schend, Eleanor Barker, and Kathy Archibald from Milngawi improved the world record by showing time 4:13.260.
The UK Command has come to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to take possession of the average Olympic Games and earn a lot of medals.
After the extraordinary demonstrations of full superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have waned in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas in the second place, not the last, from the position of Technical Director Shane Sutton in April on charges of sexism and harassment, and from the care of large figures such as Hoi and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first race on the bicycle race, it seems that the legendary glory of Britain now seems to have reached its peak at the right time, perhaps once again.
Future of the Portland steel plant threatened by the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland Aluminium Plant in Victoria — as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers — is threatened by the fact that the electrical company that supplies the plant is said to be the owner of the factory to terminate the supply contract: all contracts are expected to be terminated.
This step is a consequence of a decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be threatened at Alcoa's factory in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — may be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the metal industry consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed down a metal mill in Point Henry, leading to the closure of the power plant in England last year.
The Portland metal company Alcoa is losing money and risking closure.
These actions have resulted in reflection on the future of the plant, which has lasted for several years, initially because of the strong positions of the Australian dollar and later because of the cost of production of the plant.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminium plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrob Valley, reported that it expects the other three owners to also take steps to terminate the contract.
The controlling share of the plant belongs to Alcoa and Aluminum's joint short-term enterprise, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp are smaller.
“AGL expects that the Portland facility will continue to work, i.e. that the physical demand for electricity from the steel plant will not stop,” she said.
According to AGL, the contracts mentioned are the so-called hedged contracts, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month termination period and are therefore actually completed in 2017.
“Therefore, AGL still expects that these contracts will bring its share of the income in the financial year 2017”, the power company stated.
Any potential impact on AGL's profits since the financial year 2018 is limited to strong futures market forecasts for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its reporting by $187 million in terms of “provisional termination”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to operate a metal plant or to supply electricity to a metal plant”.
The American company stated that in 2010 it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was due to enter into force in November of this year, but it still had to explain why it had terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland steel plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the economic disadvantage in the industry.
Addressing analyses earlier this week, AGL Chief of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy annually and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electricity].
For us, as a producer, it will be bad," he said.
Not only the Kardashian Realities Star, Kendall on the cover of the Vogue September issue
Kendall Jenner, 20, the model and fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Genner clan, Chris's mother manager, appeared on the US magazine Vogue, which was taken over in September.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and deflated fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in her Instagram account on Thursday.
“When I was in the room with my loved ones, I looked at the cover and cried, ” wrote Kendall.
News of the cover was accompanied by strange (or simply in the spirit of the Cardassian Family?), prepared by reality-video, in which the whole Kardashian-Genner family (deboshers Rob and Caitlin, also joined by the world's most popular show business uncle, producer of the Kardashian Family, Ryan Sikrest), forgot the presence of the sister on the cover, and at the end, the classic turn: they planned a surprise party.
It's a standard storyline for almost all episodes of children's television shows dedicated to their birthdays, but Chris needed this fame anyway for other girls.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September Vogue, we have certainly entered the new era of the Kardashians show.
Let Senior Sister Kendall Kim take the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on it with her husband, Kanye West, in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is the most sold edition of Vogue in the year.
More like a gift magazine than a fashion magazine, the production attracts huge numbers of advertisers (based on Fashionista portal, 615 pages of last year's 832-page publication contained advertising).
News about which one of the stars will fall on his cover is expected with such anticipation that in the last two years, photographs of the magazine have merged to the official anon.
The previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has, of course, represented more “scientific sites that work in models” than “models that are celebrities”.
The winner of the Oscar Prize and the face of the Dior Jennifer Lawrence brand was presented on a cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gage fell.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, whose magazine described as the "extreme model" of his generation, falls into the first category, she's in a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, stars of reality show or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
They are truly talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful careers in the production of the Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone enjoys Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, given her past star of TV reality show, should have always been neat.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment".
These moods have become a little bit distraught after the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But it doesn't make sense to stick to resentment.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the Vogue September issue.
She's a supermodel in all the ways of that word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you a tonal cream from Estee Lauder.
She and all of her sisters are selling you photos of themselves in their own apps, which are available on the payroll.
She sells handmade photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter's LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, maybe to still see her sister Courtney and her kids, she's taking part in a reality show on TV.
Public legal centres refuse to service 160,000 persons per year
Each year, more than 160,000 least protected representatives of the population refuse to serve in public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for an impact that will further reduce funding for activities already already under way.
In Queensland, three out of five persons — mostly older persons, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people who are unable to fight unjust property deprivation and so on — have already been denied free legal assistance and representation.
Public legal services that are already working outside the scope of opportunities are preparing for further reductions.
Since June next year, these legal centres must lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of the Queensland Public Legal Centres, James Farrell, said that thousands of people have been denied a year according to the latest census of the National Association of Public Legal Centres.
Farrell said that if the federal government decision was not annulled, the situation would only deteriorate.
“The Queensland Community Legal Centres have consistently received insufficient funding, which means that thousands of people are denied vital services,” he said.
People who deviate from violent relationships, people with unmanaged and destructive debts, families who go through divorce, unjustly fired workers — all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will manage the funding by 30 per cent since June 2017, which means that thousands of less protected people in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis to cancel these cuts of funding immediately so that people can receive the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
Last year, the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to draw attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and it is time for the Government of Palaszczuk to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's election headquarters was brought before the court after the officer allegedly threatened him with a gun.
According to reports from New York City, Donald Trump's pre-election headquarters reportedly did not do anything after the report that his North Carolina Operations Director threatened a gunman when they were driving in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday at Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the pre-election headquarters of the state.
Bordini said he'd been waiting months for the problem to be resolved internally, but he realized it wouldn't happen.
Director Earl Phillip "pulls out a gun, puts his right index finger on a chicken and puts a hole in Vincent's kneecap," says Bordini in a complaint.
Regretting the local and regional office of the pre-election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more people had become involved in similar incidents with Phillip were being appealed.
“Guns don’t have to be shot to harm,” Bordini said in a complaint.
It was only two days after the candidate for presidents from the Republican party made a furor, he told listeners in North Carolina that “men of the Second Amendment” — known as gun owners and their lovers — could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and able to elect judges.
Trump ' s pre-election headquarters said that the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not expressed support for violence.
In his complaint, Bordini required compensation from the pre-election headquarters for negligence and from Phillip for the threat of physical violence, abuse and moral harm.
The representative of Trump Hope Hicks made a medal in response to the request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip have not been successful.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left election headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovation Consulting Services, no one called back quickly.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump of the Republic party conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, McLenburg High Court (Charlott).
Britain must send the Olympic spirit to the right direction and expand the Heathrow
Rebirth and prosperity will also be a trickle for us, not only in our human settlements and in general in London, but throughout the country.
As for me, it was precisely the great advantage of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to benefit our peoples and regions from the Games.
The Olympic Games have brought great benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we'll do it again, creating opportunities for local residents and firms near Heathrow.
For our human settlements alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs, and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, those who think that the challenge of expanding Squirrel is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games, and that we would find ourselves in a difficult situation on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012 and will prove them wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow answers any question about him.
Like the Games of Heathrow, the Olympics are an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for a narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have an excellent team in Heathrow, which has implemented £11 billion of infrastructure investment in a timely manner and within the budget, from T5, selected by the best airport terminal for five consecutive years, to T2 built in the middle of the world's two most employed airfields.
They are now ready to provide a third flight lane, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 Olympic Games in London were a great success for the British, and I am sure the expansion of Heathrow will be as well.
The time has come for us to direct the Olympic spirit to the right direction and to expand Heathrow, to ensure our business future and to create the heritage of skills and jobs that Britain will be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton — Chairman of the Board of Heathrow and the former Trade Attaché of Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook plays "cat-mouse" on blocking ads
For companies that earn money on Internet advertisements, trying to bypass advertising software is a mouse cat game, according to one company that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block advertising blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on social media again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site changed the vertex around its advertisements to make it more difficult for advertisers to recognize which parts of the pages are advertisements.
But Adblock now claims he could bypass the new code.
In his blog release, the representative of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of mutual struggle between the community of blockers of open source advertising and those who try to bypass it has continued since the invention of advertising blockage”, and perhaps Facebook will present its own decision soon.
The fact that the largest social network in the world has entered a struggle is a clear indication of how big a challenge the advertising blockers have become.
Around 200 million people worldwide use advertising blockers, according to last year's Pagefair and Adobe research; almost four times the number of people using such software in 2013.
Given the 1.3 billion daily active users on Facebook through mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook revenue from advertising.
However, the company is looking for blockers to advertise on the desktop because mobile blockers are ineffective in Facebook mobile applications for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
But advertising in the table is a fairly profitable article to make Facebook consider such a step a beneficial investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its “advertising preference” tool to give people more control over how advertising was targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that Adblock's new filters were disturbing, as they would also block some unreputable content on the site.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to address this problem," said the representative of Facebook in an official e-mail.
Adblockers are a rough tool, so instead we focused on creating instruments like Advertising Advantages to hand over governance to people.
The woman was moved to a Swiss highway in an episode of apparent suicide.
The victim was on a highway in the middle of the night.
The police called witnesses after a woman had moved several vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident occurred at A1 near the Morge in the canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman was lying on the road in the darkness of despair and was hit by several vehicles, she reported to the police in a statement.
In an attempt to kill themselves, a Swiss woman, age 49, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several of the drivers involved have already been questioned, but the identity of some has not yet been established, the police have informed them and someone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case had been initiated, a “logical” step in such a situation, according to counsel Gil Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is still necessary to determine whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
This must be determined by the prosecutor," Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be found responsible.
In each case — both of which involve a person walking in the dark along the highway — a sentence was issued that motorists cannot expect an accidental encounter with a pedestrian on a highway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of causing death recklessly after she struck and killed a man at A1 near Payerne at night in August 2014.
A 22-year-old victim drank and fainted on the road, listened to the court.
The court found that a female police officer, who had responded to an emergency, had managed the vehicle in a manner that was justified, and that the presence of a person on the road was “a perfectly exceptional and unpredictable situation”, the judge said.
Someone with information about the incident on Thursday near Morge should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus once inhabited
Venus may have once been inhabited, according to NASA ' s new climate model.
Scientists from the Nacional Space Research Institute Goddard developed a model for research in the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climateologists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and carbon dioxide-sufficient atmosphere, could ever exist, such as Earth-like conditions.
Scientists had previously suggested that Venus’s slight rotation rate was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modeling suggests that Venus could probably have a diluted atmosphere like the Earth's and still turn slowly.
The model also reviewed the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a 30 - percent tight sun.
“According to the GISS model, Venus’s slow rotation is setting its daily side of the sun for almost two months at a time,” explained GISS scholar Anthony Del Henio in a press release.
This warms the surface of the planet and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as an umbrella to protect the surface of the planet from a substantial part of the sun's heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which are a few degrees colder than on Earth today.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to that previously assumed by planetary scientists.
Even though Venus may have been inhabited for several billion years, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans evaporated, and her water vapor was burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When her hydrogen flew away, all that remained was the dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect — Venus, which we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new climate model, Venus, in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is leaving Avalanche's team coach.
Patrick Roy left the position of coach and vice-president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey business on Thursday, referring to the lack of influence during the team decision-making process.
The executive vice president/head of the Colorado team, Joe Sakik, confirmed the news and noticed that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have been performing my duties as chief coach and vice-president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey business with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer, I spent a long, hard time thinking about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needed and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice-president of the hockey business must be ideally consistent with the vision of the organization.
It should also have the right to vote in decisions affecting the team.
These conditions have not been met so far.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," said Sakik.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy became the winner of Jack Adams Award as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and victory in Central Division, but Colorado was devastated by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and played playoffs for two years.
Avalanche announced the evaluation of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and left the Wild team five points in the fight for a second concessional trip to the Western Conference.
The doorman from Slava Hall, Roy won four Stanley Cups — two with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
The Northern Sea Petroleums resume negotiations and suspend strikes
Working strikes on oil wages in the North Sea have been suspended, and all parties to the debate are starting a new round of negotiations, the leading representatives of the parties reported.
Strikes against the Wood Group oil service company were sporadicly organized on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unions Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve ongoing disputes," the joint statement said.
We will have a few full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting next week, to look at issues with a fresh view.
Trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in over 25 years, was against potential wage cuts of up to 30 per cent.
This year, Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contract staff working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent due to negative market tensions.
The decrease in the company's rates was after a 10 per cent reduction in the rates for contract staff working on the coast in 2014.
According to companies, additional reductions would give it the space needed to overcome the decline in the market.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people and has announced plans to stop oil and gas activities in countries by up to 10, as it rationalizes its activities as a result of its mega-merging with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of lower oil prices: the economic situation has deteriorated as a result of the decision to leave the European Union, which was adopted in June by Great Britain.
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labour conflicts in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, was vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in new projects in the North Sea are expected in 2016, compared to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of the stars in the Pleiades Spears
The last space telescope mission, Kepler, helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of speeds of the stars in the Pleiades excavation.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why the stars in the clusters rotate at different speeds and how periods of rotation are related to the formation of planets.
"We hope that when we compare our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Ribal, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
Pleiades is constructed in 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the vault are now only mature; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're turning as fast as they'll ever be.
At their peak speeds, these adult stars emit large amounts of wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds cause a braking effect on the stars.
As the star ages, its speed slows down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star, tracking the time between the observed stars — such as the sun’s spots.
The new speed catalog assumes that more massive stars are turning slower than less massive stars.
Fishing compares stars to dancers: the larger ones make pyruettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In ballet, we see that those who spin slowly are usually more massive, while those who turn faster tend to be very light stars," said Ribal.
Since the replication of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of the stars with the speed of the rotation.
“The star formation of the Pleiades provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both junior and senior,” said Ribal.
We want to know a lot more about how, where and why the stars slow down their speed and hang their "dancing shoes" on the nail, I think.
Fishing and its colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the Pleiades speeds in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation into the activities of the group of detainees in Crimea by the Ukrainian Diverstants is conducted by two agencies, writes "Kommersanta".
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of diversions in the Crimea.
As previously reported, confessions were given by the resident of the Ukrainian city Energodar Evgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
He said that he considered the Titan Hymzadu (Titan) in Armensk, the Phoethebase in Feodosia, the Kerchen Parom Transport, the pipeline, and one of the military airfields.
Law enforcement officials believe that not all diversoratives have been detained.
This, inter alia, was the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev regime of Simferopol, notes the publication.
The main coach of Russia's soccer team is Stanislav Cherchesov
At the meeting of the Russian Football Union, a decision was taken to appoint a leading coach of Russian football team Stanislav Cherchesov.
The contract will be available for two years, until the end of PM-2018.
On 11 August, he appointed Russian football coach Stanislav Cherchesov as Russia's chief coach.
He is a well-known footballer who has previously played in Moscow's Spartacus in the position of the goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who has been the mentor of Russian teams, such as Spartacus, Zemczina-Soci, Terek, Amkar, Dinamo, and Warsaw's "Legia", which has been the winner of the country's national championship and cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed as soon as possible and will be for two years.
It is therefore his duty to prepare for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that Miroslav Romashenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Pannikov will enter his training headquarters.
There is information that the salary of the entire training staff will amount to 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to the media, the management of the RFF has set a goal for Stanislav Cherchesov to bring the assembly of Russia to the semifinals and win medals.
As the coach himself said, he considers the establishment of a competitive environment in the team as a priority and intends to give football players the opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he was glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match led by Cerchesov will be held by Russia's assembly team in Antalya on 31 August, which will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Remember, Leonid Slutzkiy, former head coach of the Russian football team, combined him with coaching at the CSKA Club.
He announced his resignation following a failed presentation by the Russian national team to Euro-2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the poor result of the assembly.
Namibia was severely affected during the long struggle against apartheid between Angola and South Africa.
However, since the independence of South Africa in 1990, this country, with a population of 2.4 million, has achieved tremendous success, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success is that the Government is paying great attention to education.
While people in developed countries perceive as self-sustaining free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries in secondary and even primary schools they require fees for education.
Moreover, Governments are often encouraged to introduce fees for training for “reimbursement”.
In Namibia, however, primary school education is free of charge.
Moreover, secondary education has become free since 2015.
The country ' s authorities are also active in other important areas.
Malaria eradication efforts have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 per cent over the past 10 years.
Despite the international trend in inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
As compared to the 1993 figure, the Gini rate, which is the standard indicator of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, that figure was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate decreased from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) has also declined from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest free speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The United States and other rich nations have been well ahead of the country.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating, one of the highest in Africa, in the Corruption Perception Index, which is composed of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now, when commodity prices are falling, Namibia is able to maintain a high rate of growth.
At the same time, debt-to-GDP ratios are around 25 per cent, which is less than 1/3 of the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
Unemployment rates, at least according to traditional valuation methods, still remain high enough - almost 28 per cent.
And like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high incidence of HIV/AIDS, with almost 17 per cent of the population infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is among the higher middle-income countries, but authorities insist that their State is indeed a developing country.
Namibia is certainly facing some difficulties that are common to poorly developed economies.
The State has to develop a very large and dry country with a small population.
In the deserts, there are isolated nomadic hunter-gathering tribes, which must be integrated into modern society in one way or another, without losing their identity.
Integrating people who were on the edge of the world economy for a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: like any other country in the world, it is facing the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia did not think to give up, the country solved its problems.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities were engaged in the creation of a diversified economy and a united society.
It is remarkable that competing political factions have gathered together to work for the common good.
In fact, Namibia provides cheap medical services not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of medical visitors in northern Namibia are Angolan nationals.
No one in Namibia mentions the construction of a wall that separates the country from the poor and corrupt neighbours.
The Namibians understood that neighbours did not choose, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate to share scarce water resources, participate in regional medical projects, encourage investment and exchange of students.
Furthermore, the Namibian Government has rightly reasoned that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of few by many.
Authorities understand that Namibia ' s natural wealth income needs to be invested in infrastructure and productive capacity.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek the maximum profit from the sale of the country's resources, and to review investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, and strong support by the Government for freedom of speech is so important.
As the Head of State Hage Geingob noted, the media often say that he dislikes it.
But after fighting for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect its freedoms, the President said.
Not all key resources of Namibia are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, are revolving, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Each year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious shortcomings - racism, colonial order, inequality and low development - can embark on the path to global prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the Golden of Varna, the oldest gold objects created by man (4,600 - 4,200 years before our Common Era).
Perhaps it was the loudest archaeological sensation in the 1970s: in Bulgaria, at the excavation of the Varna Necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts was found, more than three thousand in a total weight of six kilograms.
Only one burial known as “Megil No. 43” resulted in 990 gold items of a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the oldest gold in the world could soon turn to a discolored van found by archaeologists in July of this year.
Again in Bulgaria, in a prehistoric settlement known as the Telle United.
Unlike Varna, a port city, the Tell Junati is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunati of Pazardjik district.
Busina is a gold band that is turned into a ring.
Yavor Boyajyev, the director of the excavations in Tella Unataci, dates back to 4,600 B.C.E. and states that she is at least 200 years older than Varna’s gold.
The treasures of Varna are dated about the same period, from 4,600 to 4,200 years before our Common Era.
There is currently no technology to allow accurate dating of metal.
How, then, can you be sure of what is more ancient gold?
Apparently, Professor Boyajyev knows more than he told Reuters: "I am quite sure that the gold of the mighty is older than the gold of Varna."
This is an extremely important finding: it is a delicate object, but it is large enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Boyajyev, scientists were about to analyze the composition of the metal, and they would re-examine the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the van as accurately as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell Unaci is a town famous, even if you have never heard of it.
The Tell UNACI is now considered to be the oldest city of Europe.
The Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium B.C.E.
Over the years, metal processing has been rapidly developing in the region, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full industry.
A special name for this archaeological community is the Balkan-Karpata Metallurgical Province.
In the 5th century B.C.E. around the metal processing centres, settlements of the urban type began to emerge.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, the Telle Unaci may be the most ancient since the artifacts of the 4900th century B.C.E. were found here.
I'd call the Telle Junati a prototype of the modern city, although it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“This is a place older than Shumer for a thousand years,” says Boyajyev, referring to the widely accepted view that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in a common understanding of the word.
The Tella Unataci has been in operation since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have unearthed nearly 12 hectares, about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall, which once reached three metres in height, were found.
Not much has been preserved from houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish between streets, public buildings, town buildings, business centres and residential landscapes.
The Tell United is often referred to as the Bird City: dozens of bird clay figures have been found here.
All birds are depicted in a state of peace, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects but the object of local worship.
The Bird City was destroyed about 4,100 years before our era, perhaps by the Indo-European tribes from the north-east.
The nomadics had no cities, so they had horses and guns.
They were not stopped by the three-meter fortress walls.
Archaeologists have discovered clear signs of a violent fighting that left behind the remains of old men, women, and children with wounds caused by a battle axe.
New discoveries and new facts appear annually, changing the traditional notions of the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly speaking, not of individual cultures, but of the “lost” first European civilization in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive to find this civilization was the gold of Varna, found relatively recently in 1972.
Logically, Varna's golden rosary was to be preceded by something like a tiny gold van created in Tella Yunataci.
In Porsche, the 911 Targa model has been artificially aged
It is officially stated that 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is conducted by hand by specialists of the unit that operates with serial machines.
Retro-luc is, for example, in a special color of the Ethna Blue body, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model, even the model logo is adorned in this color.
In addition, the fair received a firm white chart along the boards and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel discs, as well as some bodywork details embellished in “white-gold metal”.
In the retro-reduced interior, it is noticeably smaller: it is largely distinguished by a grey-blue gammut, new seats with extended electro-regulatory ranges and separate black anodized steel thresholds with a unit logo.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a gift from a car and a richly separated album with photographs of the production process.
The force of the Porsche Exclusive specialists did not touch them: the retro-narga of characteristics is quite consistent with the series.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder turbocharged engine of 3.0 litres, 420 litres and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released with limited circulation, but neither the amount nor the cost of each particular athlete is reported.
Facebook and advertising blockers unleashed an “arms race”
The recent introduction of Facebook technology, which prevented the concealment of advertisements on social media pages, provoked decision makers to block advertising for responses.
AdBlock Plus released the antidote, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus has advertised its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
The socialists noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of unblocked advertising, the AdBlock Plus solution, along with commercial advertisements, also blocks many of the usual posts from friends or pages.
On Facebook, such policies were regretted by AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
As reported by the source among the social workers of TechCrunch, the code making AdBlock Plus useless on Facebook will be ready within the next few hours.
Thus, the socialists and the blockers unleashed some kind of “arms race”, trying to play each other, but the affected party was by users who missed interesting recordings of friends or saw advertisements where they did not get used to seeing them.
The ethical aspects of blocking advertisements have recently been fuelled by heated disputes.
In Murmansk, the rapist will be brought before the court · Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been investigated by the Russian Federation Committee of Inquiry on the Murman Region.
The charge against a 54-year-old man is very serious: sexual violence.
As a consequence, at the end of November 2015 the accused in the area of Pavlov Street in Murmansk committed sexual acts with violence against a 20-year-old girl.The criminal case with an approved indictment was sent for substantive consideration.
The sanction of the article provides for the maximum penalty of up to six years ' imprisonment.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia crossven Fengguang 370 and pick-up Rich New - Rulem website www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of China’s popular class of vehicles, which combines the dignity of mines and crossovers.
Another declared Russian Prime Minister is a pick-up of Rich New.
Many Western firms in Moscow's International Motor Show this year have decided to ignore, so the empty Crocus Expo exhibition halls will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which is large in Russian markets, is going to be a powerful front, and is going to offer our car owners a number of interesting news in the near future.
One of them will be the Kroswen Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which was sold in China at 55,900 Yuan (a little less than 550 000 rubs at current rates).
The Russian people are unlikely to see such a price tag, and the issue of deliveries to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 was able to reach 11th place on the list of the most sold mines, although due to high road clearance (175 mm) and protective plastic cover on the lower perimeter of the body, it is quite possible to include crossovers.
Crosswen is built on the Fengguang 360 junior platform, with the same 2725 mm wheel base in the 370th, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is solider and the equipment is richer.
The salon was decorated with wooden planks, but the large vertical sensor screen "like Tesla's" on the central console was only on the early crosswind exhibits, and the cars with music were sold more simply.
Five of the seven landing sites are easily folded, forming an even loading area of 1,650 mm long, with a maximum luggage capacity of 1500 litres.
The Fengguang 370 engine consists of only one - 1.5 litre "atmospheric" with 115 lcs, which is connected to a 5-step mechanical transmission box.
The manufacturer is modestly silent about the dynamic quality of the car, but promises a budget saving for the owner of an appetizer of 6.7 l/100 km.
Picap Rich New is a well-known Russian-known Nissan NP300 Navara from the past generation, but with a slightly defrocked Chinese stylist design.
Despite the morally outdated design, this model still has a stable demand for a Chinese consumer as a reliable and unfriendly “working horse”.
At a similar price, Rich New will certainly be interested in the Russians because modern Japanese pickups have become expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two choice engines: petrol 2.4 litres (137 litres) or turbo-diesel 2.5 litres (116 litres).
The gearbox is only mechanical, the drive is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a rigidly connected "front."
On the Dongfeng stand and the new Flagman Sedan A9, his Russian Prime Minister's representation of the Chinese firm was announced in June.
Mine-like crosswords on the Chinese market are increasing, one of the latest news is Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian ambulance Dongfeng consists of two models: S30 sedan and H30 Cross Hetchbeck.
During the seven months of this year, the dealers of the Chinese firm carried out 696 vehicles in our country.
Transport tax notifications will cease to be sent by mail - Web site Za rolem www.zr.ru
The tax inspection changed the procedure for sending property tax notices.
All Russian motorists have become accustomed to the same pattern over the years: in the summer and autumn they receive a receipt for the previous year ' s transport tax.
However, many will not be expected this year.
It was the fact that the tax inspectorate had made no unnecessary changes in the notification procedure for citizens.
Those who are registered in the personal office of the taxpayer on the official website of the office.ru will receive the notices electronically.
In the inspection, such Russian users were automatically considered to be online users and deleted from a standard paper message.
Novelty concerns all owners of vehicles and real estate.
All others will continue to receive regular letters.
In fact, there is an opportunity to go back to the old scheme and to have a record on the site.
In order to do so, they would have to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more comfortable.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after writing, while the letter will go for a few days and may be lost altogether.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of the tax inspectorate has passed over 18 million people, allowing the agency to seriously save on mail.
On the other hand, modest news on the inspection website is clearly insufficient to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some could register in the “personal office” to receive a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for notice by mail and will, without knowing it, fall into the category of non-payers with all the consequences.
Access to the personal office of the taxpayer shall be made in three ways: through the recording of the gateway gosuslugi.ru, by electronic signature or by entering the log and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained personally from any office of tax inspection (independent on the location of the account).
It is recalled that this year a transport tax must be paid by 1 December.
The communication began in July.
The Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-Class, which aims to achieve a very high impact, is something within itself.
But the controversial concept did not upset G-Power's masters, who took the initiative to modify the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
The G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human is foreign to its masters.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63-571-strong flying cove with aerodynamics of a tank and dispersion to a hundred per cent by 5.4 seconds?
With the "muscles" of the crazy "helica", the artist took advantage of the five-litre eight.
Now, the displacement dynamic has improved to hundreds indistinguishable to 0.1 seconds, and now the flying cyrpić is capable of breaking by 5.3 seconds.
In fact, the acceleration at average speeds is probably better.
The velocity ceiling is frightening: if the standard G 63 is no faster than 210 km/h, the Tungsten all-roader with the de-activated electronic fuse is capable of lifting 250 km/h.
Outside the car is almost indistinguishable from its factory source, except for other wheeled discs - 23 inches Hurricane RR 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach Luxurious Unit has announced a stunning six-millimeter conceptual cluster that will be presented in the Pebble Beach Elegance Contest.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the BMW i Green Subbrand and will promote its electrical models under a separate brand.
In the coming years, at least four environmental innovations are expected.
