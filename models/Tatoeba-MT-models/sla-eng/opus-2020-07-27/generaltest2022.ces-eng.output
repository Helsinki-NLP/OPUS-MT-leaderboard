A great return of the Czech loser is coming.
Paul the Frenchman was called to the NHL
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel Frenchman, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
A 30-year-old mold relative will be on the exchange and will soon be able to get into the goal.
Former goalkeeper Litvinova, Plzně or Russian Cheljabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
In the middle of the game with Vegas, he's been changing, and he hasn't introduced himself to the NHL sliders since.
There was an incident when the experienced goalkeeper moved from one pole to another.
"Pavel Frenchman will be out about three to four weeks with injury in the lower body," the denver general announced at the beginning of October.
His return to goal in the NHL eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, American time was called from a farm where he captured four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, 94.5% of the procedures were applied.
The breeder of Plzeň hockey finally wants to argue and confirm that he belongs to the world's best league.
In his last year, he had problems with his hips and did not catch the only game in his short pandemic year.
In the NHL “Francík” captured 36 games, its success at 92.3%.
Charles puts on a Christmas wish Camille clothes, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate, as this year’s Christmas wishes, chose a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan.
The Prince Charles also made his wish known, who used a photograph on which his will Camille helps to put on a mask.
British BBC news stations reported on their website.
They send their wishes to friends, workmates, and foundations with whom they cooperate.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki color and the dress also has Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing just like Prince George and Louis shorts and a shirt with a collar.
Whoever took the photograph, William and Kate didn't give it, it's not even clear when it came.
Last year, a royal family for a photograph designated as a Christmas wish posed on a pack of straws in front of a pile of wood in their rural residence in Norfolk County.
The photograph, which serves as a Christmas wish, was also published by the follower of Prince Charles' throne with his wife Camilla.
The photographer Sam Hussein caught them in June at the Ascot reaching.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and on the face of a mask, helps Camille put on her mask color-adapted with a bright dress.
Slavia according to ephotbal.cz promised Berbro a million per title, Tvdzik denied it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption cause allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former chairman of the Czech Football Association Roman Berbr had promised from Prague Slavia a million crowns for the league title in 2018/19.
The ephotbal.cz server informed him that he had reached part of the police files.
The chairman of the Board of Directors of the Supreme Club Jaroslav Tvrdík said that the red-and-whites did not tolerate any corruption.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia featured its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended last summer at the championship club.
According to the file, an influential red-and-white official was in frequent contact with both Berbre and the former sports director of the then Second League Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also in custody among the accused.
The criminals reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbrovi promised a financial reward when she won the title.
2019 won the team SK Slavia Praha title in the first league.
The police authority was aware that Roman (Berbr) is to receive a million-dollar fee from the officials of SK Slavia Praha, the server quoted from the file as saying.
A day later, according to criminals, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Slavie Hardzyk.
According to the server, it is no longer clear whether the police are still involved in this information.
The fort rejected any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively sought to change the ratios of the Czech football and offered an alternative to its development.
We have never committed an illegal act, we have not sought to influence the referees in contravention of the rules of fair play and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this regard," said the Claimant for the List of Reports.
Some former players of Slavie’s dark skin, including Nezmar, are irrevocably insulting, as well as slandering his former head of fortress.
In mid-October, police action was launched in several places, including the Prague headquarters of FAČR.
The highest in the affair is Berbr, which no longer operates in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, just like former sports director Vyšehrad Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are laryng cold wars.
The works will be new, but in principle the worse type (the artillery must carry hand-carved cartridges from the armored cabin).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, have already managed to get rid of Prague V3S and specialised units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of rent, transport - too small with a short flight, but modern.
drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we don't have any (but we produce and balance abroad)
PVO: medium-cold, outdated; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I've got stuff like that.
I've got an errand right next to town.
They crawled out of the river and did damage to crops, so I was sitting there.
When I arrived, I saw a fisherman on the riverside.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something came up, but of course, there was a fox.
I let her come 40 yards before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost fucked himself, waving a man on every side, so I called him to say it was on the fox.
Before I got off the property, he was out.
I mean, a husband's reputation as a pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it'd have to be a lot of coincidence to make something happen, you'd probably see it in a thermovision that almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, expensive things to put to your feet in the bag, and you should be okay.

Inwardly, respirators are much cheaper than the Ministry of Health.
The State responsible for the purchase and distribution of towels, masks and respirators for the professions closest to Coronavir has issued billions of crowns for their acquisition in the past weeks.
The server iRozlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during a single day, the amounts for the respirator differed by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why were the prices moving so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why else did they buy the track?
Lenka Kabrhelová is talking to the editor of the server iRozlas Dominika Kubištová.
Soldiers and armies I appreciate (although I am not affected by the memories of ČSLA that have passed through earlier generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the compulsory war.
We don't even have large warehouses of techniques that can be trained, we don't actually have modern techniques, nor do we have existing professionals, but modern technology is increasingly complex, so the ability of the publishers will be rapidly lost in time.
With modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can put them, they'll be very quick, and it won't be time to practice again.
Finally, publishers/territorial defences are of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where they go to lead a mass guerrilla, and it is also an express necessity to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, fighting is only in conflict with this extent and intensity, where the guerrillas will be irrelevant, and we do not have the appropriate geography.
We don't have an individual skill set.
That's not even the worst part.
The worst part is, half of them play like they have one.
Then you get the situation that you're looking at a guy who missed an empty gate two minutes ago, runs into an attack by himself between two or even three Swiss and says, "what do you think is going to happen now?"
Well, of course they're picking him up as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this scaffolding is so terrible that I'm caught up that I'm genuinely surprised to see that our attacker was able to play one player against a rival.
First Voltage
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts for the following weeks do not expect any major reversal.
Hospital pressure according to statistical models has lasted for some time, and the pandemic equation has arrived, as we know, a new unknown: a variant of omicrons, which is very likely to spread faster than currently ruling Delta.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause more serious progress, how much vaccination or post-infection immunity obtained by the previous treatment of the disease helps against it.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon on the side of the pluses also entered the codividal equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, an antiviral molnupirivir antiviral, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease progression and associated third hospitalisation and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by the Paxlovid drug from Pfizer, which reports success of up to 85 percent.
However, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronary pandemic, the first deliveries of monnupiravir to the Czech Republic have also raised the question of how the administration is ready for incoming medications.
As was said to be the first to receive Merck’s molnupirivir to local patients.
The company ended up on tape as well as because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find appropriate treatment for horse viral disease on the South American continent.
In this research, it is often overlooked that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
Therefore, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying "how did we grow up".
See, you do research where you ask people if they like muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people say no.
In the West, they'll tell you how they like migration, how they should all help them, and how we Czechs are racist shit.
And then they go and they pick sides like AfD.
He's afraid of Cancel culture, saying this in public means losing his job and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they will really find out what people are thinking.
It's only in France, Le Pen and Zemmoura, they're both over 20% surveyed.
We even know that the objects are three and identical in Czech.
Identical for the purpose of turning units so that soldiers don't have to learn where they are again, so all objects on the hair are the same.
Of one, Atom is the Hill Museum, and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is, sssr didn't want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either because of safety or the speed of head deployment due to the western position.
In these underground shells (in each maple there are two) only the heads were kept, not the whole rocket as they are called.
If it was necessary to install this weapon, a special unit came in and picked up this head and mounted it on some kind of wearable device.
Besides the museum maple, they're left in a desolating state.
At the second grade of elementary school, we had a classmate, Gypsies, and we were with him for 4 years.
He was fine, he made good jokes, he often showed up too much, but he was our mascot.
Everyone was talking to him, and he often wanted to explain something, he was missing a little bit, he was going around regularly, he was doing sports with us, he wasn't stealing lunches, he wasn't stealing phones, he was walking around in clean clothes.
He'd ride in schools in nature, he'd do all kinds of monkeys, but he was fine, maybe never a mess.
In eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies in the same year, other classes joined.
Shortly thereafter, the teacher was beaten, the police often handled something, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an advert (old things, something I don't need, etc.) and I've sold often to the gypsies, they always had money, they didn't try to pull some attempts at me at a price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like that, and the guy called me a month later, and he's already rewritten it.
I'm telling myself I'm not a racist, I don't care if someone's white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, as long as they're acting like they belong in a decent society (working, working, women don't beat, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, he stretches his hand, he settles down flats and houses, he's got a mess around him, he's making trouble, so it's the same color he's got, but he's gonna mind me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they get involved with us, start doing business, work, learn language (not necessarily English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my tradition and culture, I will be theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachaticka
“The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and unfortunately, despite her injuries on the spot, she succumbed to the law of the spokesman for the South Bohemian health workers Zuzana Fajtlová.
The driver who took the girl probably blamed the crash.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot brand probably went from the municipality of Žíhovec to the municipality of Bavaria and, from the sources not yet established, went in a turn to a counter-direction.
After the collision, Škodou Octavia finished the Peugeot vehicle on the roof outside the vehicle, describing the accident of the spokesman of South Bohemian police Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young Peugeot driver suffered a very serious injury during the accident.
It was a multiple injury and he remained in the car.
After his release, he had to receive acute pre-ambulatory care, and in a stable condition he was airlifted to a Czech-Buddjective hospital, according to rescuer Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the second car suffered a minor chest injury and was transferred to the hospital.
New rules apply to non-EU packages, customers often do not provide data on them
Lukas Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He's got a collection card, mostly.
"It can usually be tens of dollars, let's say from ten dollars higher, where it's still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free," the collector approaches.
Since October, small shipments have been slightly strained, new VAT must be added and the post office must pass on data to the customs procedure.
There's an e-mail telling him the customs are expecting a package.
All you have to do is fill out the information about the consignment, and if VAT is not already included by the trader during the sale, it will be measured by the customs office from the total amount per consignment and for transport.
In the event that the address does not provide for the customs procedure itself, the sum must also include the remuneration of the carrier.
According to Luke Neuheisla, the whole process is not complicated.
I'll call one or two tear-off fields, put two annexes in, and I'm done.
It's usually a five-minute question for me, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments can be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of shipments received from abroad from 60,000 to 15,000 was reduced to an international post in Prague.
In addition, according to the Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to the requests for data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 shipments of international mail that we need to work out.
If people filled out all the data they need and filled them in on time, we would be here in about half, says Czech Postmaster Matyáš Vitík.
A Solution to Inflation
See the headline, how would you suggest solutions to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and are expected to grow further.
What do you think he should do to slow this growth down or compensate?
We see, in Poland, a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think's gonna happen, what's inevitable with where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it's inevitable that people won't be able to afford normal things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who's the employee)?
I was added 2% this year in gross, which is a laugh, but luckily I have a similar income from the business that I operate at work.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why violent criminals are sending themselves in chains for, like, six months?
This head just doesn't understand how a court can only send such an animal out of the grid for six months just so he can do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to his/her victim having a trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relations and relationships in general.
And not to mention, the rape victim doesn't have to come back from that either.
Isn't this the potential future rape report for the victims?
A man from the grave "scared" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the grave was reluctant to help the guards to secure his entire-state girlfriend from Costumlat, on whom the arrest warrant was issued.
Because he brought them to her.
But they're gonna give it a shot.
First he reached out to a passerby and made up a story about being robbed.
After the emergency call, the guards arrived at the site and were not surprised when the alleged “stealing man ” told them that he had made up his mind to have the officers come to the scene.
In fact, he simply wanted to advise the officers on how he was to report to the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers then found out that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide search, and a warrant was issued for her to be arrested.
The case is therefore resolved by the PRC.
An honest question for people here, do you consider our country Slavonic?
Personally, I am of the opinion that the words of long ago are not ethnic or cultural, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with me, of course, that Churchill failed to ensure the release of Prague USA :')
Of course, I don't deny that we have a Slavonic language.
Well, I don't know, it's kind of a question of whether a rational person can actually trust something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I wouldn't consider such a case to be the true faith myself.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there's an estimate in the world, if I'm not mistaken, something about tens of thousands of different religions.
Which god or god should a man choose?
I'd say it's quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions, there is at least one god that will punish you in a way that you believe in the god of another.
But even in the Corporal there is no other god than Yahweh.
Would it not be more rational, then, to hold back faith in any god than to risk choosing wrong from those thousands of gods, and the one true god I just missed will send me to hell or something like that?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is much the same.
X months of training (in various specialties, X months per one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you're doing well, you can get a pro offer.
All the ACR files could use something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defense.
We can say this: There is always a lack of cooperation between the education sector and industry, businesses are hunting in schools, and there is some spillage where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only during adolescence, but this process takes place constantly, each of us constantly learns something new, moves from one field to another, etc.
Similar spillage should also work between the civil and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a relationship between a citizen and an army, an institution that guarantees that the Russian, German or Mongolian invader will never come here again.
I think it's funny how you think of NATO as something tied to a rock, we have allies, and so they'll defend us if there's trouble.
Well, you'll love it.
There's only one choice in the US that's going to twist their budget and NATO is going to fuck.
The British will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have shown themselves to show them their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that works long-term as a guarantee of independence is the armed army and the population that can control the military technology of their time.
And today, he can fly remote control every teenager in the world, so what could it not be?
We don't need border restraints, that's fucked up today, but a colossal teenager behind a remote controlled device book can handle it.
How not to drown in a box of tsunamis
You unpack your presents under a Christmas tree and all of a sudden you're home filled with boxes and fills?
This “waste” is again used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
This is why a map of the shops that your used boxes welcome.
And it's not just about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring in a connected trade after agreement (KAMSIM.cz project map contains almost 150) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillers.
This will support small companies, reduce the amount of waste created and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The sales themselves welcome packagings that are currently lacking in the market as well as saved money, as the packaging card has betrayed 50% in the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One such business is TIERRA VERDE, the producer of eco-drugs and eco cosmetics.
The boxes and the filling material in Popovec near Brno are shared by individuals, but we are also contacted by companies with whom we have arranged regular transports of deferred cartons.
We'll use everything in packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we form a more inclusive world together.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for another generation, says Petra Lolušníková of Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only locations for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (to remove the diluted waste from the household, where you can deliver the past medicines, tyres, electric payloaders, batteries, light sources, heavy-duty waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end up in the right place, in addition to the reused items found in their second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such sites.
“The collection courts, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity malls, SWAPs and other places that help find use for things that would otherwise become waste,” adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the app authors of Uklidima Czecha.
I find it rather wrong that nowadays, technology is so simple and stupid, that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently there was a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of components on the computer.
Because like Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones in general simply hide the underlying filesystem with the components and everything fits on one screen in the application.
They can use technology from childhood, but let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, really.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency before the weekend – starting in January – and it was grand.
Macron spoke for over an hour during which he discovered the Presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many actions that they could not reach in six months.
French politicians like it that way, and they like voters.
Macron's promoters of the gap between right and left agree on little, but it is in Europe that they do.
And in France, there will be a new election of head of state in April.
The election calendar has also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is ready to create conditions for such a work of historians.
A number of commentators rushed immediately with criticism that Macron was involved in pro-European propaganda and was rewriting history.
In fact, it's trying to rewrite history rather than defend it.
The extremely right-wing candidate for French President Éric Zemmour is now going around France with the fact that the Vichy regime, which co-operated with Hitler during World War II, has not been so bad, and has quite a success with the French.
Let's try taking Macron's idea to one of his history books seriously and let's not look at the events in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries are teaching history a lot as a story we versus them and never as a story in general.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs find out who defeated whom in what battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know what the wider context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech Mouse didn't win.
The story that goes back to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre also received awards for the director and best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovyak Festival, he was stuck at the front of the audience ladder.
The best actor in Berlin became Anthony Hopkins for the movie Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy and I'm not vaccinated.
It was kind of like a "feeling flu/feeling bloated" thing for a couple of days, and I didn't feel like smoking...
It was worse than a common flu.
I don't have diarrhea in my flu.
I'm not saying that's the way everybody does.

Its use of brutality overcomes the human version and builds up in horror with emotional emptiness.
And that the way back to instincts is shorter than one willing to admit
In his last novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story about the return from emigration than we used to listen to.
Those who stayed, and those who left, knew too little about themselves to spend their lives together.
Trains are starting to drive according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers will change.
As of Sunday, they start riding trains on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some routes, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Cologne, where RegioJet starts to ride instead of Czech roads.
For most lines only the departure time is adjusted, or slightly also their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The transporters started selling their tickets in the autumn.
The Czech routes plan to deliver on average 6,78 passenger transport connections daily in the new timetable, which will be on average 478 long-distance trains.
Trains will travel some 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
Roads along the national links under the new timetable will also go to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will set up dozens of new trains along with the new timetable.
The main news will be InterJet trains, which will ride from Prague to Cheb.
More new trains will be delivered by the carrier in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally raise the prices of the driver on average by 3.2 percent from next year.
Roads take account of inflation in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is access to R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace the Czech Routes after the success of the Ministry of Transport competition.
On a daily basis RegioJet will deliver a total of 16 connections on the track, eight in each direction.
Further changes relate to the remote connections between Prague and Brno, which will also be stopped from Sunday at Havlíčkov Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations.
Leo Express maintained its 16 connections, two return connections in Slovakia and also a weekend connection in Krakow.
According to spokeswoman Emil Sedlarík, the carrier tried to preserve as much as possible the driving time of his long-distance trains despite planned exclusion work.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier shall also be changed in certain regional lines.
The changes await passengers, for example, in the Czech Republic, where the Trilex German company Die Länderbahn will ride trains on the line from Mladá Boleslav via České Líp to Rumburk.
Passengers will also be able to use a uniform railway ride for the second year.
As with the Czech roads, their price will rise by 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Aren't we learning to look at the other side?
We hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed, and they had to scream, they died.
In my life, I've never heard any training from a slave's point of view or from that point of view, nobody's defending this, just condemning it.
No one will even tell you in school that blacks often sold blacks themselves into slavery and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one in school will teach you that colonizers often bought land from Indians, but they will tell you everywhere how brutally we Europeans killed each other, killing each other a long time ago.
I also spent some time in the United States, right in schools, in northern schools, as well as in Southern schools.
I haven't seen anyone deliberately silence the facts, but I've heard before that it's happening, and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it.
My point was that history is not black and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about people's feelings, it's just what they're like, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at the thing from then on.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do that again.
By the way, while we're in the Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slavers are quite popular there, on the other hand they also had some good success and I came to dismiss them absurdly.
In addition, the North has not been much better, as many people today idealize it.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in South was a slave and a lot of things were against them.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, deliberately overlooking some facts, lying and manipulating, or maybe there's no view of them (there was also a video on YT from the TV, where someone who started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What came to me at U.S. schools was ridiculous was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country never experienced.
In general, I found that at some universities it was shocking, those students were quite radicalized, and these schools have supported them in so many ways.
And when I imagine these people getting a lot older once, I feel a little sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because it's among the young and even in the ruling elite.
I feel like maybe feminism has long since achieved what he had and it's not the same, he's radicalized.
At present, feminists are referred to as women who have nothing in common with him and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups like LGBT, and this leads to radicalisation on the other hand, where this often leads to resistance and to quite reasonable things.
Besides, the more radical someone is, the more they hear him.
Anyway, in conclusion, I didn't see anyone convicting me of colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I met with the wrong geography, but it was a two-way :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's totally pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Moreover, the concept of nationality is generally considered unnecessary in terms of any personal identity.
If there's something that connects me to people that interests, views of the world and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and one is Slovak.
The slovak priest is a very nice guy, he has a sermon more about theology than politics, but then he fucks up some cock about the coronavir that everyone is ashamed of.
Then, of course, the Church is Czechoslovak Husitski.
They are officially Protestants, but in fact they were born from a Catholic modern and are actually Catholic without the pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to the Hussites for worship because it's theologically much similar, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically valuable functionalist temple on Botanical Street.
Otherwise, St. Michal's church in the Dominican Square belongs under Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. do Masses in Latin, as it did before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the pandemic of coronavir, but this time they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal – Břeclav border crossing in the morning.
She was picked up at the border last year.
The Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we share with the section every year, I look forward to it.
It's an honor for me to have been chosen, to tell the present journalist Scout Amalia Budeková.
While last year the handover took place at the border crossing of Mikulov-Drasenhofen, right on the border bridge, now at the crossing of Reintal – Břeclav in the parking lot.
Usually, however, scouts drive by train to Vienna.
Nothing changes on the spread of flame in the Czech Republic.
With the betelem light, scouts traditionally took the train to Brno first, where they handed it over to the diocese bishop Vojtěch Cikrlem.
The following light distribution will be carried out on Saturday, 18 December, by scout couriers who will travel by selected speedboats and personal trains.
They will take the light from them to local scout stations or volunteers, who will then continue to spread the flames throughout the Czech Republic and wherever the railways do not run.
Even this year, scouts must comply with the measures in force against the spread of coronavir.
It's happening just like last year.
We recommend both to these courier teams and to the organizers of local events, of course, to wear towels, to try to keep the distances, to keep them as low as possible, not to sing to colleagues, just to act as safe as possible, described by the spokesman of the betelem light Zuzan Hrbková.
The tradition of betelem light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time.
The light of Bethlehem is for the believers a symbol of hope, of light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and scouts have been looking after its spread for more than 30 years.
The action is on hundreds of volunteers, and the flame is also a symbol of impoverishment and human reciprocity.
All updates, including a list of places where people can come for flame, can be found at www.betlemskevesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of an economy that confirm that subsidies are economic cancer, but I don't think a subsidy as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education will make proper use of the money, unless I understand why the money goes to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned, a useless product is produced and it breaks the free market and "the company's natural life".
I work alone in a factory where there's a million "xy funded/co-financed by the xy project" in the hallways, and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This isn't the support of a company that gives jobs to x people, this is the acceleration of development when this company is holding on and taking out contracts/employees for companies that could grow after its collapse and become more productive.
Totally agreeing, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person born on the Internet is caught in a trick or trap - especially advertising.
I don't think I'm gonna be moved by Internet commercials, but then I'm caught up that they've affected me -- it's just so out of control that you can't always stop it.
For that reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament, which currently want to give a complete ban on programme advertising (= targeted) ...
It's all crap, in the words of a classic - I would ban the Internet.
I feel that this source has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I won't believe something that the majority believe and makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I have my own original opinion that I'm going to claim to be critical thinking"
2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Television has failed the trend of Christmas movies, premiered by two hundred this year
Los Angeles – China, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English - speaking countries have failed the trend of Christmas films, and this year they will be presented to their viewers in the premiere record over two hundred.
It was calculated by the IMDb movie database operator.
The genre of Christmas Family and Romantic Films in recent years has been scoring and significantly increasing the ratings, so these images are becoming more and more.
This year, four times as many Christmas films as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those images that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will be really more holiday films.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic there are especially fairy tales associated with this period, worldwide are popular, for example pictures alone at home, Love Heavenly or Classic Christmas Story Life is beautiful from 1946.
The right boom of Christmas shots did not start until 2009 when the special film series was followed by the American cable TV station Hallmark, the BBC server recalled.
Her adventure project, called Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station began its viewers on Christmas season 22 October and will feature a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Lifetime competition stations have 35 new Christmas theme films on their programme this year, and they also contribute to the total number of popular streaming platforms such as Netflix.
“In this magical period of the story it doesn’t matter so much again, it’s important that there’s a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it is snowing,” wrote this book by the book on Christmas films called I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For spectators it is a form of escape and a way to at least for two hours feel a little calm in the middle of all the holiday madness and madness of the world in which we have been living for the last few years," Gray added.
For example, according to him, Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there's about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding, which, of course, will be resolved, and the two will kiss.
It's like this all the time, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people follow each other, they complement Gray.
Mazepin had positive text on covid-19, does not hit the final F1 race.
Only 19 riders will go to the great price of Abu Zabí in formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had positive text on covid-19 and won't hit until the last race of the season.
Staj Haas sends only one formula to track.
In the last race of the season, he had to attack a better 20th-yard location, which he went out in qualification.
However, Russia's Nikita Mazepin from Haas stables will not eventually reach the Great Price of Abu Zabí.
He was tested positive for covid-19.
At the starting grill, there are only nineteen cars, from the last stop, going to the Mazepin teammate Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen to meet Lewis Hamilton in the direct battle for the title.
Mazepine is quite well, according to Haas stable, and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita's physically okay because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the competent public health authorities, with security being the final priority for all parties involved," its representatives for formula1.com said.
He can't send a replacement rider to the Haas race. He can't.
The alternate would have to attend qualifications or travel on another part of the weekend.
There's no match for the first racer.
At the start of the final season there was covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year they were tested positively by Sergio Pérez č Lewis Hamilton.
They can put you in jail for this, too.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store and the creator put six months of work into it and all his savings.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but few experiences, never wore sweaters at home,” admits Lebanon, who spent 3,000 hours over his work for six months.
He bought silk in Italy, 24karat gold yarns in France and 2000 ornamental crystals from Swarovski.
The silver stars were then decorated with 150 diamonds.
“The basis is wool and cotton, but silk will deliver the sweater silk,” praises the creator of his work, which, of course, does not recommend washing.
And it's got one more hook.
"I am completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as fast as possible," admits Lebanon.
If it succeeds, it creates a world record.
The most expensive sweater ever sold five years ago cost only 720,000 crowns.

British and Estonian soldiers are already active in Polish territory.
Mutation Omicron spread south of Moravia?
Hygiene's looking into another case of Adam's kid.
“We currently have another suspicion of this option in the next child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov UŠ is not proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases showed up in the county this week.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases,” said the director.
She added that it was two nurses from one faculty hospital Brno and two children one of them, another two 11-year-old pupils from the University of Adamov.
There is no connection between the cases of Brno and Adam.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four non-symptoms.
No one suspected of Omicron travelling abroad
None of them traveled abroad, nor did any of their families, come into contact with anyone who lived abroad.
The relationship with the champion in the water pole is none of the above, Ciupek said.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová had previously stated that an international water field tournament, which was in Brno a few weeks ago, was being tested.
There were also players from the Republic of South Africa, and a Belgian player became ill upon his return.
California will limit the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas on a restraining order.
Governor of California Gavin News announced Saturday's plan to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state by means of a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against abortions performed following the detection of the heart rate of embryo.
People would then be entitled to compensation in a lawsuit against anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsoma's announcement responded to the Friday opinion of the US Supreme Court, which left the Texas abortion ban in effect, although it goes against nearly 50 years of precedent ruling, which laid down the right to abortion in the U.S. as a whole within 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the court has not now ruled on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on the technical issue that stems from the innovative construction of measures.
The enforcement of the ban was carried over to the public in this case, making it impossible for the Texas republicans to attack it by a common judicial route.
“I am distraught by the decision of the United States Supreme Court yesterday (Friday) that authorized the maintenance of the Texas ban on most of the abortion services and has greatly supported the manner of Texas in order to protect its law,” said the Governor of California.
"If States can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this authority to protect human lives," Newsom continues.
He said he had commissioned his subordinates, in cooperation with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice, to work on measures that would justify a public representative to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called spirit weapons.
In this way, they are labelled as home-made weapons which do not have serial numbers and which can serve to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants the “private citizens” right to demand compensation of at least $10,000 (over CZK 220,000) and judicial expenses of anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, parts to "arm spirits" or sets for their production.
“If the most effective way to keep these terrifying weapons out of our street is to create a threat to private lawsuits, then we should do just that,” said the California governor.
AP notes that California for decades has banned the production and sale of certain weapons of military style, but in June the federal judge of California blocked the ban as anti-constitutional.
If the state had now actually renewed the ban using the Texas template, the words of the liberal member of the Supreme Court of Sotomayor, who, in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict, warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states, would be confirmed.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant complete immunity to a judicial review of the Texas abortion ban and allowed abortion clinics to continue their claims against the selected factors of the U.S. state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it gradually comes to how it will look like a vaccination scheme and there is also an improvement in the vaccine itself based on results.
For example, a large 4 - dose study has been conducted from Israel.
And according to these studies, in most patients there is a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has already had a long-term effect on you.
Just like any other vaccination will have its vaccination schedule after the time, it's just too soon.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus should be placed on the market for a short period of time, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10x greater effectiveness.

Poland threatens to suspend payments to the EU budget
According to Ziber, the European Commission would be in conflict with the law if it took advantage of new powers and, due to the dispute over the rule of law, it would suspend the payment of money to Poland.
The Commission has already postponed approval of the Polish plan to draw EUR 36 billion from the EU fund to restore the economies affected by the cadide-19 pandemics.
And it is under the pressure of the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to allow the withdrawal of EU subsidies to countries violating the principles of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU by veto in all matters requiring unanimity," said Ziobro, the leader of the small party of Solidarity Poland, without whose votes the current government would lose a close majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic rise in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland suspend its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified given that the EU unlawfully denies us the funds from the common budget to which we also contribute, the Polish Minister added.
His party's approach to the EU takes on a more radical position than the ruling party's right and justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes that led to the Polish justice for Ziobrov's actions threaten its independence and subjugate it to politicians.
Brussels, according to Zebra, is building “impossible conditions, because its objective is not the rule of law, but the change of government in Poland”.
Warsaw is facing "a political dictatorship of blackmail and efforts to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles", Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of an EU based on the partnership of sovereign states, not on the government of the strongest and Brussels-based bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never take part in such concessions by Brussels, as a result of which Poland's sovereignty would be restricted.
"We will never agree to Poland's status as a colony," he said.
But to admit it... in Lidla, they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look at other things, I met one yogurt more times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelf, I resigned and I asked myself.
They had it, that's right, in that narrow sector, they were all chosen, less common and special cheeses, but it was between vegetables and a non-lactose zone...
If there's a banishment, I don't smell any more in any market, action no action, gold shop on the square, maybe they don't have that choice, but they usually have everything I need and have some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care.
For two years, I've been watching how the data is treated here as manure, most vaccine opponents are just a little more out of the ordinary than most vaccine advocates.

Sorry for the break-up, and have a nice day for all of you.
When I was a kid, they used to whack me with a cook.
It was never because of the signs, most of the time it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and angry (I read instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother etc.).
At the same time I was never punished without warning, Mother always threatened first that if I did it again, I would get the wound (sometimes even after the next "getting" the cook only brought and laid so that I could see it).
Only after repeatedly refusing to listen did I get a few butt wounds (over clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in a reasonable sense and degree) are beneficial because a child responds to them much more than words.
I think it's important that the warning part is that it gives the child a choice in his own way or he gets it, or he gets better and he doesn't get the punishment.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
Protection of the system
When the important Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl in 1999 answered a journalist’s question about what the Czech Constitution meant to him – if they consecrated a charter that he swore and learned from time to time in school, or if necessary, an agreement that could be amended, he was sure to apply to the first concept.
Once in the constitution, we agreed on democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and the changes are better saved.
And imagine: Some nations even love their rules.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl voted the question.
In recent times, however, there has been a growing trend among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
The years are tested by situations that its creators (who belonged to Vojciech Cepl) could not foresee, for example by the conduct of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference with their texts must be thought out.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to coping with most of the crises that societies face across history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a rule of government consisting of individual rules that set out the mantineles of the game to politicians.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so politicians are bound by bans.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to have their power.
Covid doesn't choose, in FN Brno they fight for the life of a multi-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder for children, there are also difficult cases in which hospitals have been facing most recently.
“We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” said the newspaper head of the Clinics of Child Anesthesiology and Resuscitation of the Faculty of Medicine of Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University Petr Dominik.
The process is much simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are children who are suffering from a disease with coronavir, which we see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild support.
It's taking place at the clinics of childhood infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavir are only recently on ARU.
Children with post-cavid syndromes were in the medical department continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute cadaver pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia requiring a stay on a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects adults as well as adolescents, as well as several months of babies.
In hospitals children are also in severe condition due to coronavir.
"We currently have a child of several months and of adolescent age," the chief said.
However, he is pleased that the children’s hospital FN Brno has not yet experienced any infant deaths at the coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 were killed in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominika, he is an integral part of the cooperation of a psychologist at the children's hospital – not only in the Coronavir department.
At the same time, it also points to the fact that, as with adults, vaccination also reduces the course of the disease and also reduces the occurrence of post-cavid syndrome.
“This is why the administration of the vaccine is recommended in children,” the doctor added.
In a quiet zone, you can only walk on marked roads.
But the peace zones aren't that big.
They are visible on a tourist map on the maps.cz.
Generally, in national parks outside the peace zone you can walk anywhere (but don’t climb over the fence into the shed).
Skiing/driving on a bicycle in a forest outside the marked road must not be anywhere unless you have an exception (but, of course, it does not look so closely outside national parks).
How does a conductor practice?
Music goes in my head, Josef Kurfiřt laughs.
It is strewn with a liberal opera and originally played on a forest corner.
As a singer, he can sing practically all the repertoire, and as a conductor he acts not only in the Liberec Theatre F. Šaldy, but also in Pilsen, in the Theatre of Josef Cayetana Tyl.
He cooperates with the gradian philharmonic, with film philharmonic or with the sub-krkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China builds the impression of disease management and the authoritarian regime facing the crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China builds the impression of the disease managed and the authoritarian regime facing the crisis better.
China has embarked on a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing reflected criticism for not being able to stop a disease that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports a zero-infected increase.
The states, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protection aids and Chinese doctors are helping to fight the coronavir, for example in Italy’s worst case.
How do you feel about Beijing?
Is it friendly support, or is the Communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
He meets a friend of a friend and says, "Hey, don't you want an elephant?"
I got him and he's great.
My wife likes it 'cause she saves the weed, she washes the car with a stick, the kids play with it.
Well, that's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Dude, let's hit her, that'll be great...
After a while they meet and whoever bought complains, "You dude, what did you sell for an elephant?"??
The lawn's broken, there's giant shit everywhere, the car's broken down, the kids' fear of it, and the wife wants to get divorced.
The guy who sold it says, "You don't talk good about elephants, you don't sell elephants like that."
World events are controlled by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is precisely the powers that determine the course of international action.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
It is currently working at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think Europe is heading towards federalisation.
It won't be 10, 15 or 20 years from now.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the moods will be different and it'll work.
I thought about it, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm a dictionaryist.
I'm just saying that ellipse usually involves 2 different units at the same level.
I will take an example from another comment on "Spanish oranges and Mandarins" when it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas "Spanish fruit and Mandarin" in Mandarins is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
In addition, I base that the sentence is "all American forces" including their weapons and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad concept, and there is no need to specify it further for American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just saying "D."
Either way, it's a ridiculous request.
There was a five-degree earthquake in Tokyo.
The Japanese metropolis of Tokyo and the surrounding area hit an earthquake on Sunday with a force of 5,0 degrees.

Vicki Holland, from Britain, tortured cosman Milly's monkey.
Horrible images show a moment when a frightened monkey snuggled in a toilet bowl before its senseless owner flushed it and laughed at it.
The Dutch monkey also fed sausages, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of their real nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrate’s Court has now banned her from animal breeding for life, reported The Sun.
Experts in the rehabilitation of monkeys who care for Milly after her abuse said that they had never seen such a frightened alien before.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitating the Monkey World workers in Dorset and now playing again with another saved monkey named Moon.
Four times the mother confessed to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to 12 weeks' imprisonment with a suspended term of one year in the Gwent Magistrate's Court.
Holland has also been sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, has been banned for life and must pay 12,000 crowns of legal costs.
The head of Small Monkeys, who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue. ”
Milly took a while before she got used to people again.
She screamed and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she settles down and is content with the male, she can keep her eyes on new people causing panic.
The psychological scars of abuse will be accompanied forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's harassment came out after the police in Gwent discovered the horrifying footage of a woman's phone after a riot in her apartment over drug charges.
You can hear Milly giving vulgarly in the footage.
In the next video, you can hear Holland's monkey offer cocaine and say, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she, along with her partner Russell Cox (43), confessed to holding cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her house was found cocaine for 1600 pounds (in the count of less than 50,000 crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland was sentenced to 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts will you learn from this truth three times in a row when you bravely leap across the 20th century?
Like, first of all, you're gonna take the same stuff you did in sixth grade?
And it all kills the idea of bifling when no one, the honor of exception, doesn't care if you know it or understand it.
Just write the test on one, and then nobody cares anymore.
Go and ask people at random on the street if they can determine the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and coefficients.
Everyone's been through this, and the absolute majority won't even choke on it, and they'll tell you they're totally fucked.
So what the fuck are they learning?
I'm a big fan of the general public, and the fact is, people don't want it and they don't need it.
And at that point, it's useless, and you'll never get into it anyway.
It's partly taught for a lot of people who need the thing.
But like, the note that you don't really need all this stuff on the machine because you just don't need it.
Plus, we're slowly getting to a time when not knowing is the mark of a punk.
(What our communist past and anti-educators and elites are likely to be involved in) However, the price of having barbarians stand for these machines is simply high.
If the press can count, it's probably never this size.
The wedding at first sight: The war of Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away," Andrea replied at an instagram in Stries to all the questions of curious fans, which she was so disappointed in Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social networks.
Between Kadrim and Andrea, it's been screeching since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea was moving behind her, at least until the Czech Republic came back.
But she absolutely refused.
And it is evident that not only did their relationship end in love, but rather grew in mutual disrespect to hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! He was upset with the turn of Kadri in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
The alleged honesty of Kadri's ex-wife didn't even like his younger sister Linda anymore.
She decided to stand up for her brother in public.
Normally, I don't speak to such things at all, and even in the family, we never really used to say these very special things to each other.
I definitely don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to make it public and dirty the name of someone I love so much, it just won't do me any good!
I'm sorry to have to do this this way, but I'd like to thank my brother Kadri for making me a character and helping our family when we needed it the most, even though at a young age.
That's what I'm more sorry about when I have to read such untrue information, which is probably quite out of context.
I'd like to know Kadri as much as I, our family and loved ones, very much in response to Andrey's words.
I'm really grateful for everything!
Of course, people will believe what it says, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above everything and know the truth and know how it really was, have added indeterminately.
The drunk thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what this is about.
Chao started his robbery expedition in a parking lot in a residential neighborhood, where he tried to get into several cars.
According to the available information, he eventually estranged less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
Then he had nothing better to do than climb up to the 5th floor and walk into the apartment with an open window.
That's where he stole two bananas.
The footage from one of the security cameras then shows him walking down the street from the crime scene and eating bananas.
When the owner woke up this morning, he found that the bananas weren't where they were, and he called the police.
Then Chaa got arrested.
The man admitted to drinking alcohol on the incriminating day.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob intoxication.
The whole thing's in the investigation so far.
The drunk climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and is bound by pandemic emergency.
If it's cancelled, the law won't work.
Although the law limits the scope of business
Isn't that enough for a reason?
The right to assemble will be limited, but not revoked.
Over 60 per cent of voters took part in Saturday's elections to four municipalities.
The new representatives were elected by the people on Saturday in the municipalities of Komňa in Hungary, Luzice in Mostecka, Nova Ves in Liberecka, and in Rovna in Pelhřimovsk.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law, or the elected representative has fallen.
There were 99 candidates for the total 28 terms of office on Saturday.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest of 33 years.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections for us symbolically closes a relatively demanding but successful year.
A total of four new or repeated elections to general representations and, above all, very closely monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place, according to Deputy Chairman Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the disease of covid-19, the choices were more demanding for equipment and personnel security.
Saturday's elections of the Association of Independent Candidates won 27.76 per cent of the votes and two seats in the seven-member office in Komnia, Hungary.
STAN's candidate received 24.84 percent of the votes, which also means two mandates.
Two chairs in the office were also obtained by the Citizens for Komňa, with 18.52 per cent of the voters voting.
Once again, the mayor of Jan Krzyžková, who is a member of the Privates, also became their representative.
The Komňans – independent candidates achieved one mandate in the representation.
The urns accounted for 75.48 percent of eligible voters.
In the village of Rowná in Pelhřimovsk, the Pro Rowna Society won.
It got 50.50 percent of the votes, which means four out of seven.
Two other representatives from the Union of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 have joined the General Representation.
The voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
Repeated elections in Lužica on Mosteck were won again by the Lusatian and Lead Association led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It received 56.73 per cent of the votes and, as in 2018, it holds four mandates in the seven-member board.
The other ended the candidate Village for the people, who voted 43.27 per cent of the voters, so the representative will have three representatives.
Seventy-seven.7 percent of the voters made it to the urns.
Elections in Nova All in Liberec won independent candidates Hope for Nova Ves before the YES Movement.
59.88 per cent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates and thus won four seats in the seven-member General Representation.

The voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
Monday's election results will be discussed by the State Election Commission.
Then they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people write to you here.
You're just playing dumb so you can have a fight with someone.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was finally the goal to make them look good).
And I don't care who believes what they believe.
On the other hand, I don't mind how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it put in, repressing science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she's caused, like those 30 years old.
Tl;dr: believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do
A man fell with his head down from 12 feet.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night by a man in Ostrava who was involved with the rescue workers of the Regional Medical Rescue Service.
The workers of the Regional Operations Centre took over an hour after Saturday's emergency call with the initial information on the fall of a man from the height.
Two ZZS crews immediately went to the site – medical and medical.
Upon arrival, the medical team found that a 17 - year - old man had to fall out of a window about 20 feet [12 m] high and hit the concrete with his head!
There was coal in Vítkovice.
But not the way it was supposed to, and the firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and direct life threats.
The intervention physician instilled his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and, after further measures under the pre-cold emergency care, his ambulance moved him to another care of the island trauma center, informed the spokesman ZZS MS Region, Lukáš Humpl.
I have more concerns than I have about coronavir from inadequate public and government responses.
The spread of coronavir in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and health personnel stand first in the fight against the disease.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking a military doctor, David the Ripper.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA had a wonderful gala evening full of interesting results.
The UFC 269 tournament was where things were going.
Outside Julianna Peňová has been able to defeat the legendary matchmaker Amanda Nunes, who has not found a slayer in seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in a light vase, led a great choke against Dustin Poirot and defended his belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly trashed Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
He also defeated his opponent, Sean O'Malley.
A surprise no one expected.
That's what the woman's struggle with the bantam weights between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña brought.
An American enters into battle as a deliberate “traper, ” Nunes did not lose for seven years and grind her teeth to the next triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes began her journey to win very actively, and the rival even gave push kick to send her to the ground.
Peña, however, was not allowed to make any other mistakes and failed to attack herself by means of a lever at her hand.
The second round was sobering and for MMA fans very tense.
Both rivals had many excellent blows and hard hooks.
And Penn also got Nunes on the ground where she started to choke her.
She had to give up and knock.
That's how an American prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
Top of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Olivera and Dustin Poirier for the title in a light vase.
At first, although Poirier was better off, the card gradually began to turn.
In the second he tried to be more active, Oliveira, who tried to take the lever at his hand.
He did not do too well, but then he created a lot of pressure, got an opponent on his back, and put a number of wounds to him.
That's why the second round won.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, to whom Poirier had resisted for a while, but then he had to knock off the screeching.
Brazilman thus defended the title, on the contrary, after two years he lost.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley's sovereign triumph, which he had already put on Raulian Paiv's hard back in the first round.
Then he received a series of precisely measured blows and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to consult Cody Garbrandt.
In spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now she lost after seven years.
The hip or the hip?
At first sight, it's nothing complicated.
Most essential names in Czech speak only one grammatical family, so it is not a problem for them to determine whether they are male, female, or middle.
But then there is also a relatively large group of significant names, in which the family is not stable.
Such essential names fluctuate between two tribes.
When folding, double ends are acquired and, in some cases, they remain in an unfavorable form.
For example, the words “vessels ” or“ hips ” are of male and female origin, in which the first one is drawn according to the pattern “body, ” in the second one according to the pattern “songs. ”
For the other group of essential names, different shapes are already in the first fell of a single number, such as ‘cradle/cradle’, ‘cedle/cedle’ or ‘brambor/brambor’ (in the sense of food).
Both forms are written, meaning the same, and are therefore freely replaced.
Some expressions may differ regionally, such as "ocrk" in Bohemia and "occurres" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is inconspicuous, similar to other Czech-Morama two words: "kop" and "kopka", "kopja" and "koblja" etc.
Some of the words that had penetrated the Czech language from other languages were originally inflexible, but they gradually took over the Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression “image”, which is the family of both male and female, or the word “buffet”, which remained in the middle generation unfavorable, but in the male limb according to the pattern “garden”.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right at the Greek borders?
There is tension on the Greek-Turkish border because of the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to betray themselves to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise Greek support, humanitarian aid is also being planned by the Czech government.
What exactly motivates refugees to make an uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
We haven't seen the blue sky for three months, and we choked, a reporter from Sydney describes
Nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals have been killed and millions of hectares of land have been devastated by the destructive fires that Australia has been facing for four months.
How do the authorities and the inhabitants themselves cope with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent drastic effects from happening, as critics say?
And what will the countries have to prepare for in the future with regard to climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová is talking to a reporter from Sydney Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are rare enough.
That's why everyone's always written all over the place.
It's awkward for people to think about what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to call it out.
I don't know anyone who's been falsely charged.
But I know a lot of people who were raped and I've seen how often they're treated by their neighborhood or by the police.
The victims should always be trusted.
The trend is that the victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
He still keeps too many people to himself.
Yes, there are also those who falsely accuse someone.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but spreading the idea that "most of the charges are made up" and that it's a "trunk" that only helps sexual rapists.
Czechs flood divided houses, families have no money to complete
The prices of construction materials have increased by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got into this mess because of it.
It does not have the means to complete the family's houses and the banks refuse to increase its mortgages.
In addition to the price of material, the price of construction works is increased.
That's why people don't have enough money to finish their family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase mortgages, which create an extremely unpleasant situation.
In a better case, people move to isolated and uncold homes.
In the worst case, the houses are uninhabitable and the families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and pay rent for it," says economist BHS Štěpán Křeček.
We will build two or three family homes in a year, and about 50 percent of us have.
For us as a construction company, it's hard to believe that we have to keep certain things contractually, even though the material has betrayed.
So we do without profit," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Sliveň.
A lot of people are just going to have financial problems.
If they're counting on the building of the house to come up with $5 million, now it's going to cost them seven.
I think some will wait," said Sliven.
The material was most fueled by copper, iron and also by the installation and heating equipment.
Construction companies, however, are also struggling with labour shortages.
In the Czech Republic there are graduates from construction and the influx of foreign workers is hindered by the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issue of a building permit is more favourable.
"The construction authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 per cent more than a year ago," Křeček said.
We're good, and we're gonna have better times.
But the real vision is missing, says commentator ČRO – MujRozglas
The entry into the new year, apart from the classic celebrations, has traditionally been accompanied by the expressions of politicians.
This year they spoke to the nation except for Prime Minister and Prime Minister Andreje Babiš and President Miloš Zeman and the Speakers of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
What did we learn?
As in that I feel like a great diplomat right now, I have my own theme that I've chosen, I've got a cod, I've always been working on it all year, and then I'll write a written part in a week or two.
The station is perfectly quiet with us, if the person is not a total macaw and something is left in his head, then the commission will not smother him for nothing on a theory.
Maybe I studied at the county hall for a week, and when I was at the end, the committee always tried to get me to do some logical drive that I liked right away and I had it right.
Otherwise, to these projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project (we've done it many times, really helpful, they'll learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're done.
I think it's great when at the end of the course there's a test to demonstrate the knowledge acquired in the project, not just defence.
All right, but don't use e-mails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be just like them.
Those people in the embassy don't have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they'd risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something might happen to them.
But you can build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Pú.
You should just put it in such a way as to throw Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws a stick at the artists.
As soon as you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will fall to a minimum.
Furthermore, it changes what function is more important if you like, comment or save.
I've been having such a hard time lately, so maybe I'll have to go down to a ticto, where a lot of artists in my industry have been successful, and they don't almost let it happen.
In the end, I might also like to see something more user-friendly that doesn't suck out of artists of all creativity and energy.
Declaration by the Work Party on Donbase
The Alliance – yes, the break-up – no, they express their opinion on the image of the opponents of the break-up of the USSR.
Thirty years since the illegal collapse of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in human history took place.
In the Bijelověžská prales on 8 December 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevič, without any legal powers and violation of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with the open-minded position of Michail S. Gorbačova, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that ‘the SSR union as an entity of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist’.
With one stroke of pen they “destroyed” a vast country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
Hundreds of millions of ethnically Russian citizens have been abroad since the collapse of the USSR.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has declined by ten to eleven million.
Regardless of the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have lost more people than in two world wars together!
Previously, the same people who destroyed what had been built in the past seventy years in a single session in the Bélowies region betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
Scientifically, they have deindustrialised, they have hindered agriculture, they have alienated from the world's greatest power the fourteen republics that were previously economically integrated into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see population poverty, economic decay, science, the army, crime growth, interethnic conflicts, war in Chechnya, all conflicts in post-Soviet space, series of orange revolutions, NATO expansion to the east, war and break-up of Yugoslavia, Arab Spring, war in Syria – all of this is the result of geopolitical surrender, surrender from the socialist camp first, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as "vacuum force".
Everything that was quickly betrayed and surrendered quickly filled and conquered the NATO countries that adopted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken by events in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a high turnover supermarket does not necessarily correspond directly with its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK/kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making it Thursday night.
In an alternative reality where I don't buy the meat on Monday, on Tuesday the chain will turn to 99 CZK / kg - describe to me the mechanism that will make the meat change its price a burden on my experience system?
And will I wait until Thursday and the meat will be reduced to 69 CZK/kg a day before the date of consumption - what would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday at 120 CZK apiece and left it 3 days in my refrigerator?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
These rumors that when something is cheap, it must be assuredly bad, corrupt or unquality are terribly retarded to tell you the truth;-)
Now, I went to Hlavas in Brno recently, and in the hallways of the missus, they were handing out some sort of brochure, I always take the same stuff to help the guards, to throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of rural reason and conservative views of the functioning of the world, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I knew it would be such an agility.
After reading it, I found out who published it and finally came out of scientology.
Well, like a good kid, full of useless lessons, like to wash and not be a pussy.
Too bad about the paper, that's why they wouldn't have to poop.
I've seen something like that with my ex-girlfriend.
Mental manipulation and emotional blackmail force you to comply with this person because you love him without realizing how much the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment, she cried so hard and begged me not to go anywhere.
Then she began to physically block the door.
About a year ago, it was a great relationship, but then another six months went by, and she started shoving on a stick.
Then I ended the relationship with her because I told her I was breaking up and lied to her, but we could talk about it next week to calm her down and not catch any amoks.
Such a person sucks out feelings, emotions, and total joy.
You better keep your distance.
When insurance companies are furiously stealing from this place by buying a cloud of tests and in a hurry to positive ones who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease, they wouldn't know about the test.
The only thing we achieve is a complication for companies, transporters and others, because their employees in the random numbers generator dropped five days of home prison.
In the west, they've stopped with the clown, and they've admitted that there's no point in solving the disease that's weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, War is new, and he needs to steal something else and drive his ego by making a fuss.
I see the good old bastard is coming back.
After several years of dampening and suppressing this non-smoker business, the MLM recruiter returns to the glimmer.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman in the VS), initial promises of training products and business skills quickly switched to "you don't have to care, especially get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I offer, because I wanted to help people, but training was more about how to scare and talk.
When the first money earned came in, one quickly realized that if he wanted to make money, he had to put in a few items a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, making one feel like a surreal pot seller.
But what I can say is, experience was valuable, one learned that one should not jump at every point and scrutinize information.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw them all in one bag.
People in this business are successful and even useful to people, but they certainly won't brag about expensive consumer goods or the "fat" account.
I didn't get a lot of that in the corporation where I do things.
HR is calm, managers are looking for their managership and they're not pushing our noses.
The regular evaluation is going on, in the form that it is going on with us (set some goals for the next year, in a year look at what's going on and what's not) - it's more of a self-esteem than someone would evaluate you by some numbers, and so on.
Corporate action is also optional.
But even within our company, we're a little bit avoided - there are departments that are more "corporative".
Sometimes a guy feels like we're such a near-startup who squats in the offices of a big corporation.
But it doesn't bother us that much as long as there's results.
The Czech missing in Britain is after death.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, the British police searched for the missing 32-year-old Czech Republic, which was lost at the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced to the demis Jakub Kulhanek on social networks that they had found a woman from Uherskohradištsk dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed this afternoon to our representative office in London that she had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
Cause of death is being investigated.
With respect to the family, we will not give more information on the case.
I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Kullhanek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28th on the bus on her way out of work, and she had to pick up the money from the ATM before she was on her way.
Her disappearance was reported five days later by colleagues at work.
Subsequently, the London police began searching for her, Interpol listed her among the missing people all over the world.
It also appeared in the Czech missing persons database.
Police in this context detained a man a few days ago.
Which was supposed to play a role in the case and what she suspected, but didn't.
At the end of the year, new representatives were appointed in four municipalities
On Saturday 11 December, new representatives were elected in Komňa municipality in Hungary, Luzice in Mostecka, Nova Ves in Liberecka and Rowná in Pelhřimovsk.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the law, or the elected representative has fallen.
There were 99 valid candidates in the new elections for 28 terms.
Election participation reached 62.41 %.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rowná, where 93.62% of eligible voters were elected.
The mandate was given to 8 women and 20 men.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest of 33 years.
A total of 13 candidate documents were registered for the new elections to representatives in the four municipalities.
Thirty-six women and 63 men were involved in 28 representative posts.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, 72 years old at the most.
Processing the results of Saturday's elections for us symbolically closes a relatively demanding but successful year.
There were four new or repeated elections to general representations and, above all, very closely monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
Most of the time, we had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, Eva Krump, the first Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, assessed.
The last constituency was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49 p.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and will be published after approval in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
To deal with the fact that we had a pretty dangerous infectious disease in the first place took me a while, but it went on without any major bumps.
Dealing with how idiotic a large part of the population is built on all its layers, that's what I've had a problem with so far.
I'm most excited about vaccination (the day of the year!) because it will finally make me less dependent on the fact that other people are not crap.
He would be deprived of the president's position and his ability to regain it.
The chances of that happening are that others are talking about very little things here.
Besides, I'm not even sure that the files that were filed could be considered treason.
Magnificence is such an act that the President of the Republic threatens sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic affected intimate life: Growing the number of people under 35 who are without sex all year round
The more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
This is mainly about religiously founded people, reports the daily DailyMail.
The survey showed that between 2008 and 2021, the proportion of those younger than 35 who give up sex life rose from 8 percent to 21 percent.
The woman between 18 and 35 years of age who said that she had no sexual intercourse in the last year is more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to research by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One may be the economic impact of the coronary pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But it could also contribute to the presence of media, social networks, or video games that make sex less and less priority for young people.
“From 2010 the proportion of men and women between 18 and 35 years of age has grown rapidly, saying that they had not had sex,” said research worker IFS Lyman Stone.
In people in marriage, sexual activity is more frequent, in 2021 only 5% of them reported having been sex-free in the last year.
Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious establishment also contributes to the loss of sexual activity.
Even though husbands are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married under the age of 35 is still declining.
Young people think about pre-marital sex, about 30% think it's a bad thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
“It’s true that among the free individuals in this age group there are minorities, but their behaviour is moving this trend,” Stone says of these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, there is a religious foundation.
Since 2008, the abstinence ratio has increased from 20 to almost 60% in single people under 35 years of age who attend religious meetings more than once a month.
Among "less believers" the trend rose from 10 to 20%," Stone declared.
Other factors contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social alcohol in pandemic times.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is lower in people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more on-line time, thus ‘compensating’ this need.
This trend was mainly caught behind the lockdown at the time of the coronary pandemic.
The whole order of vaccination against caddy is about whether a society should force a part of the population to behave that they do not want, but which can save their lives.
This is a rather difficult question that I personally care about most about about the issue of a social conscience.
I mean, the question is, if we don't tell them and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly have killed an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think that we can, for the death of a hardened anti-vaccination opponent, who is here on the side of the SPD and the KSC, complaining about the bullying and totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clear that most of the unanticipated pensioners are likely to belong to the second group, so they will actually be able to do so themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does the mild winter sign out to fight dry?
This year's winter has brought one of the smallest snowmen in recent times in the Czech Republic.
Ski operators will not get along without technical snow, weather will also complicate the preparation of the Jizera 50 ski resort.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for fighting drought in the Czech Republic?
I'd have one story, but it's not about a man.
Once in high school, the teacher led us across the city to the shipyard so that we could take a boat down the river.
On the way, we went down this wide street one time, and we don't see anyone in the middle of it - the centipede of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course we've been hit.
Luckily, I ran away, but one of my friends got into a conversation.
When she left them, we asked her what the teacher told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn't have a soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
It's not that much going on, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovich.
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz came to Warsaw on Sunday after his previous visit to Paris and Brussels, where he was welcomed with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at the joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept violations of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at Ukrainian borders is, according to the Chancellor, the western solution is to use diplomatic negotiations, including within the “Normandian Group” bringing France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine together.
Morawiecki said that he informed the Chancellor of the situation at the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexandr Lukashenko artificially caused the migration crisis and used people as living targets and weapons, because we record hundreds of attempts at (illegal) crossing the borders every night.
He and the Chancellor discussed further sanctions to make sure that Lukashenko's regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz, according to the DPA, assured Warsaw that he enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of Lukashenko's regime with runners.
A drunken Polish mill caused an accident, trying to hide it.
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but another nun was driving and tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver's license in a car accident, she went out with the truth, TVN24 said.
She admitted that another nun ran into her vehicle and asked for her help.
The officers then came for Sister Celestine.
She was subjected to a breath test, and after they found out she had two peripherys in her blood, she was immediately stripped of her driver's license.
At the same time, she was informed that she would testify in court.
Hugo the dog does what he can.
Juraj Šimovič did not watch his film.
Czech authors of family comedy have seen American tales of dog lovers.
But they forgot the essential thing: the legality of the film trade.
After F. Brabce Gump - the dog that taught people how to live, now there's another picture going on in the cinema.
Co-author of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovic ml. freely resumes his previous film Here I watch from 2012.
The talker Hugo and some famous characters around him are returning to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Retirement Pension, who zooms in, begin to invite the singer, Julie's father and her partner, and her daughter, Veronica, in particular.
She's not a little girl anymore, but a teenage girl who's having her first love.
The director and partner of Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also a producer of film) faced the process of storytelling in the previous dog photo, but there they entertained at least children and dogs.
This time, she wrote an even weaker script that caused a mixture of amazement and a sense of awkwardness.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, though a scientist, is in need of the child's dark delusions, and if the correct “constulations” come along with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates determine – on the hood of the car or the church tower (of course during the ongoing excursion with the local guide), the well-deserved Colonel Mojmír, despite the flying training, will shoot his own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who falls into a coma, where the hospital is taken away from the family so that in the heart of the forest solitude, a miraculous process of curing dogs can be performed.
Nothing against the pure treatment of nature and the strength of animal lovers.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the audience was amazed at the content of the pelmel filled with incredible situations and figures needed for this message.
Two thieves from the staff, a pianist competition, a gussian charlatan, cops arriving at the show looking for “drugs” and discussing herbs about the fertilizing power of the bone flour – which the roasted family in the guesthouse will, of course, be intoxicating.
When a hero wakes up after a heavy coma and gets up, sitting on the table with a cigar at the family table, demanding his father's whisky and flaky as if cured by a vegetarian, you can't laugh.
On top of the viewer, the creators will explain that “sometimes this happens after a coma. ”
Šajmovič's team lacks basic dramaturgic knowledge of work with text, the ability to build up the situation, the sense of character and point and the directional leadership.
The heroic performances are uneven, the cut helpless and the overall impression inflamed.
Whatever Lukas Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová are trying to resist, they don't have much to play with.
The only frame of film remains the poetic images of the Georgian nature of cameraman Vladimír Holomk and the couple of badgers.
It is not enough to plan a few figures, a chastity plot, and dog messages, even the more human vulgar expressions that are allowed by the characters.
Neither is the summer membership in the Badger Breeders Club - as in the case of the producer lady.
For good intentions to promote the nature and friendship of a man with a dog must also be the knowledge of a craft if one wants to tell a credible story.
That didn't work out in this case.
There's a little too much eroticity and a minimum sense of genre for a good family shot.
Even as an ad on canistherapy, this amateur-seen piece of shit wouldn't have gone by.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant nagging, just like you.
There's a difference between offering and pushing, and you can see how shit you understand it, but that's just because you never tried it.
The decision is always on the customer, if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you'd listened to those shots, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, if that's a job for profit.
The Middle East is plagued by unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time in a year when it rains.
"The complete absence of precipitation during November, as we recorded at some stations, is unusual," the Israeli Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Gilad in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long - term precipitation average for November.
Therefore, the two - day rain of this week was rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a while.
It's also the right Christmas ball. The inhabitants of Nazareth rejoiced with Wassa Ashkar.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, striking and irregular.
The rains of winter depend on forests.
Without them, they beg and tend to fire.
This is not just about forests, but also about drinking water supply and shelter for farmers.
The largest freshwater resource in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, was filled this spring with the last three rainy winters.
The levels have been dropping ever since.
Water managers warned of drought a long time ago.
"It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a collision here," said the Israeli Water Authority spokesman Uri Schor in 2018.
Israel can help with technologies such as desalination or recycling of waste water.
There are worse economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
In the streets of the capital Jordanska, Amman, tank cars are arriving.
Waterworks and private wells dry out.
"This year, orders rose by 70 to 80 percent compared to the two previous years," Imad Sulejman, a truck driver, reported in September.
In Iran's Isfahan, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was dry.
The Koryto local rivers were completely waterless.
The region has followed the driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military action against Iran
The Israeli Defence Minister stated that the Vienna meeting did not bring “no progress” and that he had informed Washington about preparations for the attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reported.
Gantz, who lives in the United States, is trying to convince Americans to put pressure on Iran, but has also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna did not bring “no progress” and world powers“ understand that the Iranians are messing with them. ”
About three years ago, this happened to me, too.
I've been poking around a little while while I've been talking to the missus to find out what she wants me to do.
Finally, I found out that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
'Cause I really don't like these scams, so I gave the missa some more doubts and questions and finally thanked and left.
You can tell me I've been a pain in the ass, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and the financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains for the weekend, waiting for them to snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major skiing effort this weekend.
After an excellent snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no snow of emergency and some skiareles have thus started operation.
The rider did not even discourage the obligation to prove himself to the train by means of a model certificate.
While the riders do not complain about the lack of customer interest, some ski rentals report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in Liberec region went to the racetracks and to the slopes for the weekend.
Skiers wanted the weather that the sun offered today and excellent snow conditions.
“We are happy, the opening weekend really came from the Friday night skiing when we had our first skier on the hill,” commended the director of the Sport Area Ještěd Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went on their first weekend skiing in the new season, too, to the Jesenics.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or the center in Branné, Šumpersk were opened.
The weekend visit was very decent, on Saturday and today 400 people came in.
The conditions are great.
Today the sun was shining, it was about minus three degrees, so the perfect, did not spare the praises of the ski resort's representative at Branné Rostislav Walk.
Skiareal operators can only sell skipass to people who are vaccinated or are within the time limit following the treatment of covid-19.
When people are prepared for the exceptions and prove themselves to be necessary documents, said the ČTK René Hrone from the Špindler Mlýn Ski Centre.
"We only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Less interest than before the pandemic reports some rentals and ski equipment stores.
The interest in leasing skis is fortunate.
It's not like last year, but there's still a lot of customers, said Alexandra Bokisová from Skiopava's Opava store.
More pressure is expected during ski courses.
He also feels that because of coviding, Snowbear David Shinták is not as interested in renting ski equipment.
That time before the pandemic, we were almost borrowed.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, said ČTK Shinták.
According to him, the pandas were lazy and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded in Novako’s property on God’s Dar.
Hiring skis started there a week ago, and the applicants already have to order them in advance.
"We are starting to borrow this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a great interest, as well as last year," said the operator of the area Pavlín Nováková.
According to her, the interest is comparable to that of pre-eminence skiing school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
There are smart and skilled people going abroad who don't have any assets.
The owner of the company is not really going abroad.
But with the rest of it, I totally agree.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will simply not live in the Czech Republic.
Immigration from Hungary began by winning the Orban one beautiful day, the year reigned, and suddenly annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is election at all.
If he's going to live here wrong, some traditional V4 freak can win.
The young and educated will leave, remain their supporters, and people whose assets cannot be put on the plane.
It's a scary photo!
Langmeyer in the blood for a beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic it was full in autumn, in Thailand the staff of the film Ostrov led by Jiří Langmayer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather!
The actor on social media published a bloodshot photo of the face.
Is it a real injury, or is it a shooting trial?
The London Police are still looking for the missing Czech Republic.
Last time she was seen on the way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is not much like her behavior and we are starting to worry about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth district police department, said in Saturday's video, where Srncová worked.
"Her family in the Czech Republic also has great concerns about her and wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech Republic according to her on Sunday 28 November around 19:45 left work and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3rd by one of her associates.
Srncová, according to the British media, acted as “an assistant nurse” at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to Guy's and St Thomas Hospital.
“We have great concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” said a group of medical devices in Twitter.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information to help find her to contact the police," the communication continued.
The public is also invited by Ms Harman, a member of the press conference on Saturday for Srncová.
“She’s been missing for a few days, she’s only 32 years old, she’s from the Czech Republic, her parents are of course to die,” said a laborist politician, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her, because she was out of her home country, away from her family and worked here for our health care," Harman said.
Police had previously detained a man who remained in custody in connection with the case.
However, according to the BBC news site, the police did not provide any information on his identity or what he was suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine that way either.
They're not "great quantities," they're about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine constantly repeats that the threat of invasion we are increasing and beginning to have our entry full of teeth.
I was quoting upstairs.
I don't know what made him think that Russia wanted the war.
War is a bloody expensive joke and Russia has a GDP in Italy.
Comparison with situations in 38 is out of line so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare that to the first Punish War and the Anexia Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine has announced that it is unwilling to comply with the agreements from Minsk, Russia is abating those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that "concentration" on the border would be so appropriate.
What, pacta sunta servanda...
New timetables have been in place since Sunday in Prague, especially with regard to suburban connections
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) have been waiting for several changes since Sunday, especially in connection with suburban connections.
New lines emerged, some changed the route, and others disappeared.
The newly integrated system involves Mladoboleslavia.
In the capital, they have stopped the rapids from České Budějovice at the Garden City station since Sunday.
In the suburban train transport, the S7 trains will take the route from Beroun to the Czech Brod by the Prague main station.
The R17 from České Budějovice and Benešov will be stopped again at the recently operated station Prague-Zhradní Město.
The PID will expand to other areas.
Among other things, they will take the buses to Light above Sázavoa, Blatna near Jesenice, Old rafts and Turnov.
Buses will be included in Mladoboleslavska, including lines with crossing to Liberec and Královéhradecké region.
77 lines will be removed for integration, 37 new ones will be introduced and 12 operations will be adjusted.
A new bus line 405 will come out of Prague Zličín, which will go to Žátce.
There was also a new direct link between Prague – Kralovice u Rakovník, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
They will be sent in the morning peak and on weekend connections from Prague to Rakovnik, when the express line 404 will start again.
Newly, the PID system includes links 400 and 410 going to the Liberec region.
They are leaving the metro station Sřížkov, not from the station Kádraží Holešovice.
The 400 spine line goes through Mělník, Dubou and Czech Lep to New Bor and the selected links continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimona and Jablonny in Podjeszdě.
On the contrary, the new operation is cancelled or limited on a dozen central Czech local lines, including Mochova, Dobříš or Rozmital under Tremšín.
All trains leaving Prague are cancelled at 2:30 p.m.
Due to the modernisation of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the tracks of Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín.
Change awaits passengers also in other places.
Buses replace certain cancelled railway lines or expand the section on line 420 from Dobřeš with a follow-up from Prague where it is possible to use the PID tickets to Milevska.
The change was achieved by the routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymbursk and the routes of some buses at the border of Central Bohemia and Horzovicek in Pilsen Region have been adjusted.
Healthy snack / lunch at the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only way to get food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidlu.
Since I don't have any movement, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietily as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and I'll buy as fast as I can a pizza bag and a yogurt and an apple snack.
Question: What healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend that I buy in a supermarket?
Not everyone's waiting for a foot of snow like you, I'm afraid.
And it's not about the trees you need to see.
Under the snow, only the top of the tree can hide.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason they're banning us from driving off the slopes, but it's one of them.
Daria's confession of a relationship with the unsub: I wasn't looking forward to this at all.
The Czech show business pond has been nothing but the discovery of Dary Rollins and Paul Nedděda's relationship since Friday.
They've been pulling it together for years, and a famous football player even got divorced because of a singer.
Dara now sent a comprehensive message to fans explaining why she kept love from them for half a year.
“I allow myself to say that there is no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would miss that Dara caught a bear, then I'm sorry, Nedvěda” joked Dara Rollins, who was in the most successful Czech football player in love to the ears.
He said he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although the public is interested, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both weren't looking forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continued.
I just don't know who's worse.
If those who don't care about it and jump out of a can, or us whose lives they question in detail.
It's like one of you wants to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend are good enough, or whether you insisted that everyone really knew the list of your former partners and were aware of your mistakes and mistakes.
It's a joint, that's what you want, it's a Daria problem.
Two of them teamed up in Italy, where Rollins drove to prepare her new fashion collection.
Once again, the unsub acts as Vice President of the Juventus Football Club for a long time.
They didn't go out with the truth until now because they were waiting for the end of the Neddy divorce.
My wife Ivana and I have been separated for three years, but they haven't been married for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us that, thank you.
We're just people, we have families, children, the past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new man, and just like he does, I stand by him.
Hey, the other commenters probably already said everything, but I'm just confirming that the colleges are great until the beginning, my classmates mostly met and friendly during the first semester and found a place to stay together, which seems like the best option, because you know who you're gonna be living with.
The apartments usually don't come too far ahead, so you probably won't find much right now, but I'm sure it won't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, avoid not only Cejlu, but also the surroundings (streets such as Vranovská, French etc., it is quite a bad address), and some parts of Jewish are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, Vevira is very student, the King's field, and it's fine that way, except it's close to most colleges of the VUT (I don't know where you're going exactly).
I never wanted to rent, but I'm a born Brno, so I can consult with Brno as such if you still lack any information :)
But that's an example for me of completely "normal" thinking.
In fact, because of what has been decided to be done by several doctors somewhere in Poland, it is perfectly correct that the state does not adequately fund some schools.
Either they learn what they want and they pay for it, or they go according to the state, and they pay for it.
After all, we can't let a private actor control a piece of education just because a full-fledged state contribution is due to a few crowns, and this will help him learn what he wants in schools.
Such a claim is somewhat lost when written by a person who said this about a petition for the boycott of the totalitarian state two days earlier:
So the vote against someone going to the abortion is the same as the vote against some statue standing on the square?
If I were you, I'd consult the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already seen in catalogue/digitalisation that (and even longtime professionals) it either somehow throws it away from the eye, or they write something in the xxx *** way or ... (according to the convention) and the remark that it is unreadable.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite legible, so I probably wouldn't recommend it completely.
Personally, I would have dealt with it in a note based on what program you use.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some sign databases and find the nearest one.
But because it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or the printer simply created his own character that fits into what's physically on that coin.
PS: Is it by any chance Odrysk Empire (Kingdom) rather than Odrynsk?
PSS: Someone's already ripped you apart.
Look at this comment with
Politicians have no idea what the topic of our Presidency will be.
This is much worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood any text is smiling.
All the important approved documents are examined word for word, and no basic knowledge of English is enough, that's a matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in different EU institutions, and English is better suited to politicians for informal contacts, for establishing over-standard relationships.
In addition, with this English, it is quite interesting, after a gig by GB from the EU.
I don't get the Cyle hat.
I've been working there for three years and I'm totally fine.
How many times do I drive from work at 10 o'clock in the evening and never any problem.
The fact that it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who's barely set foot in life.
Yeah, there's probably most of the Roma population of Brno, but the only thing they're doing is obstructing the sidewalk and parking where they don't have :D definitely isn't that I'd be afraid to climb the street there tonight.
So if you're looking for a relatively cheap apartment with good access to the center, I'd rather go into it.
A lot of apartments are now newly reconstructed or newly built.
Felix Slovoček (78) without Dada and lover Gelem as a stake in the fence!
Who's he spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people at the shelter lit their first candle, Felix Slovak.
I don't have an adventure, so there was nothing to light.
Dada wreath I saw and Lucie certainly has one too, told Bleska saxophonist, who so confirmed Patras's words that he visited her often.
He's visiting, but he doesn't live in their home in Vinohrad, where Dada stayed alone after he left.
He still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We met recently with Anika, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slovak and Lucie Gelem: Again!
Felix Slovoček and Lucie Gelem: AGAIN!
But we kept talking, so it wasn't Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm going to be.
I'm buying presents on an ongoing basis, and I'm sure I'll buy Dada and Lucia something, maybe perfume.
I'm a gentleman, Felix added, who himself came to christen the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I'll always find someone I like to have a good time with, he claims to be a Slovak who was happy to meet the wife of Human Saturday Adrian or the singer Camila Nyvlt.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt anyone will defend us and our location is so strategic that an aggressor would have to be a complete idiot to keep this territory out.
And I don't understand why that should be a bad argument, so explain it to me.
I don't know any other component that could be placed in hospitals in a crisis.
Cops are few, and they can't afford it, so is firefighters, and nowhere else is a high percentage of well-trained people on such a level.
And the fact that our army is capable of defending itself so only Ostrava is going to head the previous governments, not the army, she's been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record dry in Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not only be a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst period of drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has been lost in mountain and sub-mountain areas, and a small amount of precipitation is recorded in places where there has not yet been an emergency for moisture.
The cause of drought in much of Central Europe is climate change.
But the impact also strengthens the way we manage land.
What do you prepare for drying?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, that's right, I can't stay in ice skates, mushrooms I know what hockey is, and the tactics (which I've tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) are also total hallucinations.
And whether you're a hockey team, Russian Bear or llama China, lose by two goals, even if you don't have to win a match at all costs, it's different than when it's compared.
But either way, what I'm listening to Czech commentators exhale, what the referees are not paying attention to, whether it's male or female hockey, it's all weird, but it's probably with all the sport, UEFA and "Italian actors" or F1, WRC motorsport, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And to them, if it were the other way around, and that already the Czech Republic and Russia have lost more often than won, it would probably be a classic "they lose" vs "We won".
Coronavirus: Number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
There are 5766 people hospitalized.
Overall, 34,451 people, 74 others, died in the Czech Republic.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic in 1967 at 100,000, 871 at 100,000 in the last week.
The number of diseases in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new diseases have been registered.
It's the lowest daily count since 13 October.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, it's the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain faces a "inevitable" large wave of disease caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, the chief medical advisor for the British Health Agency, said on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their numbers to rise.
No one has yet died on omicron, but hospitalization takes place about fourteen days after the disease and the death of about three weeks after the disease.
Chief of the British Labour, Keir Starmer, stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently broke the law by having, last December, when a lockdown was introduced and were banned from Christmas parties, organised a Christmas quiz at Downing Street.
One minister of Johnson’s government argued that the quiz had been made “virtually” through a computer.
However, it was attended in Downing Street by a group of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, the pressure to remove Johnson from prime minister's position is increasing.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson’s ministers organized a numerous party despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are angry that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of commercial television ITV for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won an overwhelming victory in general elections.
This morning, the Conservative Party is saying that it needs to be removed from the post of prime minister.
It's remarkable how fast events have evolved.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is waiting for spring elections that can end the 12-year-old government of Viktor Orbán.
It'll be an election of pan-European importance.
How much can you expect to be fair?
It's not gonna be fair.
They probably won't be free either, because they weren't even the last two elections under Orbán.
His side controls the media, changes the boundaries of election districts to profit from it, and makes other smaller or larger tricks.
The last one sounds like everyone can actually vote wherever they want.
This will allow Fidesz to bring voters from determined districts into those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they're not going to be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is very different.
It used to be that, not if Fidesh wins, but how much and if he has a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that more votes and mandates will win united opposition.
That's for Victor Orbán and his side of the big mess.
Won't they keep playing harder?
Yes, we have some indication that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, she escaped to independent media the recording of the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz Lászlóa Kövér, where she tells the chiefs of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news.
It all starts with the tongue.
I was beaten pretty often, last time I was 14, my mom didn't have much patience, neither did I, her dad had a long time, but then she beat extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I'm very choler and I got angry like a little thing, to the point that I was lying on the ground in a cramp and it was all blue, it was about 2x taken in the shower to calm down.
Sometimes they clapped at me, sometimes it was more like they didn't know.
I definitely have a tendency to deal with things with violence now, as a kid, I've been fighting pretty hard, and now I've got to beat myself into something really bad, and as a kid, maybe I've been slapping my parents so hard over my arm for a while (so they don't get too much over my dick), so never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my explosive, but I'm sure the education has its share as well.
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose my patience with my kids, too, and I'm gonna do the same.
I think beating kids is just wrong and that my parents didn't do it, especially at the time that it wasn't "educated" anymore, but from frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just shits things out, I don't think it's possible for their kids to at least let it go away, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me in any way, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws are to be clear and clear.
Therefore, I would call the Kundami what the laws form in such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not afraid of a loss of income?
You can really count on people wanting the product and buying it, and you'll have what mortgage to pay from?
Kočner's delusional world.
Where will Slovakia move the process with the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins with a four-year indictment for the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
She promoted civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marian Kočner and his involvement in Slovak politics and justice.
How crucial is the process for Slovakia going to be?
This is what journalists can do.
How is it possible that this petition had more media attention on a regular basis than the opposite of the dean's heels of every medical faculty that came out two days later?
No, they got fooled and the company bounced.

Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of a repository nowhere
The proposal of Minister Karl Havlík needs to be thoroughly recast
Prime Minister Andreje Babiš's government is at the end, and the law, which was intended to ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorisation of a deep repository of highly radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government has suspended the discussion of a proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the government after the negotiations.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the municipalities concerned united in the Platform against the deep depository, but also with the Union of Cities and the municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-governments expect a stronger strengthening of their ability to decide on the repository, as promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation has started and which requires the Czech Atomic Law and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to rework the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The bill proposed by Minister Karl Havlíčk, who has the Platform, highlights the municipalities in particular: The proposed rate of involvement of the municipalities and the public in the decision-making process for selecting the site is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens.
Indeed, it can only be effective if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all in the given location.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Storage Management to request the approval of the municipalities concerned prior to the initiation of a specific procedure.
The present proposal of a substantive intention almost completely prevents public involvement and makes citizens of the municipalities virtually ordinary statisticians in permitting proceedings.
The proposal lacks system compensation settings for municipalities for the whole search and selection process for the repository, its authorisation and operation.
The representatives of the municipalities do not really have much opportunity under today's legal standards to defend the interests of their citizens in finding a place for storage.
Only in certain permitting proceedings may they make their comments or withdraw, but the Office or the Minister in whose interest it is to issue a permit shall decide.
Any action shall have no immediate effect on the conduct of research or construction works.
The co-decision of the self-governments that the Platform requests is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries and, most certainly, in those where they have already advanced in allowing storage sites, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is in addition to the further failure of the state administration, which employs external law firms to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SURAO and subsequent to the contract with attorney Jane Zemanek.
According to the contract register, the total amount for these works is almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, the mayor of Cejle municipality from Hrádek and the spokesman of the Platform against Deep Storage said: After the ministers of industry, who compared the position of self-government to the state authorities in finding a deep storage of highly radioactive waste, we expect a more substantial turn from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Cities and Communities for its support, which sees the issue of insufficient municipal rights in such essential construction as directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The Platform against the Deep Storage comprises 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to promote a change in the State's access to spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to a deep storage facility.
The Platform further recommends that the decision on the selection of a location for any storage be conditional on the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
The Herce of John Goodman (69) made him lose his fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for years, he was eventually intimidated by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't get lost, he would die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually dropped 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He boasted his new character in Los Angeles during the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family had asked him to lose weight because his big body was causing the furniture to break.
“I stuck everything in my mouth,” said the actor in 2018 in an interview with AARP.
I wanted to do it slowly this time.
Keep moving, keep practicing.
I'm getting to an age when I can't afford to sit here anymore, he said to ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also matters what boss and what you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's some text on a platform that's expecting a game reader, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal text and maybe a college text, I'd probably be looking for how to describe the boss or explain it.
There are more types of bosses than ever.
Like a game like Dark Souls etc. has bosses a few that yes, and so is the "boss" something like a master / ruler given the level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games are hidden bosses (super boss, Hidden boss), who are not at all needed to defeat the game or level being completed, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then you need the Half-Life games, where the bosses are, but the player doesn't work with them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they can be called that at all?
Well, then they're mini bosses.
It can't possibly translate the boss in a word, the Czech and other languages don't solve it in any way (it's only Catalan that the boss translates as the final opponent).
It is short for a story or game generally important, computer controlled, opponent stronger than any previous and guarding the completion of any level or task.
After Peter's missing from London, he's looking all over the world.
Czech police have also joined.
After Peter Srncová's missing, the British police have been searching since 3 December.
Czech police also joined the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradiščeska has been searching since 7 December.
He's also helping British police through Interpol.
Czech Republic Peter Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
The British police have been looking for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow collar for her.
So Peter is being hunted down by the whole world.
"The Czech police work closely with the British police," police spokesman Kateřina Randlová confirmed.
"We share information about the case together," she added.
The announced search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, it's 6 inches tall, it's thin, and it has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
She should come from Uherskohradišče.
Petra worked as a nurse at one of London’s hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her. Such disappearance is very unusual for her.
In the search for Peter, the local MP Harriet Harman was also involved.
She's involved in hanging flyers with Petra's face.
"We have tremendous concerns about her," she said at a Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
But it's not clear who he is and what he had in common with Peter.
The pre-Christmas Czech Republic terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While the data in October showed a slight decline in the attack campaigns, last month with the coming end of the year the attacks significantly increased.
We recorded a major campaign with Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
Attackers' strategies remain the same for now.
The infected Annex in the e-mail should draw the user's attention to a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month had a dangerous annex in the name of the word invoice, this time it was marked as Copy account repair for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of the Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook e-mail clients, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The damage code actively searches for stored registration data, which is subsequently sent to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with upcoming holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case did not specifically target the Czech Republic and security specialists in November had more of a global campaign.
Compared to October's Formbook data, it weakened slightly in November, but it still stands for almost one-fifth of all detections.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th and 15th of November.
The formbook contained the most frequent .exe file extension that bore the name REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the account continues to appear.
An annex in Czech can then be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decline and dampening of activity has been reported by security analysts in the Fareit program, which cost 1.6 percent of attacks and had no greater attack campaign in the Czech Republic in recent months.
Those smart-ass demos today that don't need oxygen, 'cause oxygen is for vaccinated assholes.
Prague was bigger than the media says.
According to images of the riverside parade and my experience as a protester, I am not afraid of estimated about 10,000 people.
The people in the parade filled the coast and the bridge and the opposite coastline communication.
That means people really do a lot.
About 4,000 demonstrators are spontaneously added to the parade by an unprecedented number of passersby.
I say something new is being born here, says Radek Wekry.
The persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or groups of people led to the finding of a common speech.
Only the anti-vaxers, the anti-ruiners and the constituencies themselves would not be able to fill or pay such a large parade.
The actions of the company The dog has a rising popularity, reminding me of a million moments for the democracy of the edges.
Sometimes I get the impression they're renting the same podium and technique.
It's hard to tell what kind of movement this dissatisfaction could be worth, not only the flow of money, but also the fact that the three-day vaccine from Pfizer doesn't become a square and more of a dose.
Definitely not left or center, bet.
The three-day vaccine will almost certainly become multi-dose because it is obvious that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
The genius of scientists whose humanity is rightfully proud.
End of Path, Bulgaria has a new prime minister reporting a change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev commissioned the formation of the new government of Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We continue in a change that won the November elections.
This has already been managed to form a broad coalition government that should take over the office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has continued since April, when the past government under the pressure of anti-corruption protests has lost its elections.
However, the winners of the fight against bribery and abuse of power were unable to agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one's looking?
From the "secret" shots taken is a global hit.
In Britain, concerns about the fate of the 32 - year - old Czech Republic have increased over the weekend, followed by the London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she went home from work to the south of the British metropolis.
According to information about the employee of the children's hospital, she calls in addition to the police and her former employer or MP representing the part of London where she lived.
"The disappearance of Petra is not much like her behavior and we are starting to worry about her," Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth district police department, said in Saturday's video, where Srncová worked.
"Her family in the Czech Republic also has great concerns about her and wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech Republic according to her on Sunday 28 November around 19:45 left work and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3rd by one of her associates.
Srncová, according to the British media, acted as “an assistant nurse” at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to Guy's and St Thomas Hospital.
“We have great concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” said a group of medical devices in Twitter.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information to help find her to contact the police," the communication continued.

In Ústí nad Labem a month hole in the road in the form of a canal without a lid.
It was about life.
The magistrate referred complaints to the RSD to which the road belongs, and because it did not respond, the hole of the cabbage further.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the RSD began to "intensify the situation".
