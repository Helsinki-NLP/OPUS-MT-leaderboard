I'm sorry I didn't have the internet, and I couldn't send it any faster.
Would you please tell us exactly where to go for cleaning tomorrow, which key code and what time are the guests leaving tomorrow and the new guests moving in?
Unfortunately, I have to decline your offer because I've really found a job by now.
I'm sorry, but I can't refuse there.
At times, I feel that the translator’s thinking in Czech differs from what I wrote in English.
We promised that if you went to school, we'd give you a surprise.
Good afternoon, I agree to the course.
Please tell me, though, is there a time earlier?
Because I'm not living in Prague, there may be problems with transportation.
If there are no options, I agree.
Thank you in advance.
Back in Herson, the people went to a rally, the Russians failed to launch.
As the Westerners told the agency, the Hersons were able to hold a rally before the military companies with technology arrived.
“We were able to hold a rally, and now the technique of the rph has arrived,” one of the participants told us.
In the past, the townspeople used to gather at protests on the Free Square, near the ODA building and the skyscrapers.
This area is now controlled by armed Russian forces who use weapons against rallyers and steal people.
On April 3, armed Russian invaders reportedly used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
According to Ukrinform, residents in Donetsk regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
Russian military forces use force and weapons against people, wounded and detained.
Russian invaders also kidnap the inhabitants of the area.
President Vladimir Zelensky has awarded Herson a special name for the City Hero.
On February 24, President Rp Putin launched a full-scale invasion into Ukraine.
Russian troops are firing and destroying key infrastructures, firing massive shots at residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, reactive fire systems, and ballistic missiles.
I dream about it a lot, Dad.
He died the next day after my birthday.
And overall, dreams are good.
Hannah, good afternoon.
So it did, as you wrote, and the phone began to charge!
Very good news!
Thank you!
We can meet for an hour or two and then I'll go home because I don't have the things I need with me.
A yard in a red combination pulls a rocket to the trash can.
You can keep the TV with the appetizer and the remote, the pantry, the pillows, the chairs, the chandeliers.
Oleg also found me a fake to clean up two quarts that give up on tourists.
The quarters in the center of Prague are located.
Will you be comfortable with me at the bank on Monday? Or another day
Good afternoon, so it would be nice if you could today as you wrote at 5 p.m.
So I read the Bible, the Koran, and others to find answers to the questions I was looking for.
Where is the house to be cleaned?
I mean, dreams are good?
In addition to this report, I am sending you a list of vacancies offered by our employers.
If you're interested in the offer, please contact us directly in the announcement.
I hope there will be room here, because our parents, my uncle's wife, her parents, and her daughter, are also going.
They have tickets for April 20th.
God forbid they'd make it.
When you get there, call me on the phone.
The cheaper would have been better... ..we had to move because we don't financially drive European prices..
I need to take a look at the place and try where it hurts.
He wants to push now on all my painful points, he knows which.
But it has absolutely no effect on me anymore.
I didn't want to talk about him and his drama at Mishi's last night.
It's impossible to close in banks, with no rain on it) when the rain is not yet closed
So I just feel uncomfortable in my own body.
This is my classmate, Ukrainian.
Alexander here is poor running from one corner to the other, there's so much that her eyes are running and she wants to be everywhere at the same time.
Only these rags were used for stymers
Good morning, I'll be at your printer for 20 minutes.
I can pay you back for the doctor.
Your coffee's here. I can bring it tomorrow.
You can have the shopping in your car and then we can take the kids and get the stuff.
I've already written you twice :))) but I'm making a double circle on trains.
I don't understand. Wally and I are gonna be together in the morning?
Did you mean that we clean up ourselves and you just control it?
Why don't we switch with Wally's shifts?
My mom's gonna live here in a dorm like the rent was for a dorm.
The important thing is that I have a place to live.
Sasha wasn't at school today, I wrote to my teacher at the post office.
I’m sick, so I’d better move our meeting to the next weekend, so I’m sorry.
I know how to cook, so it's a recipe, but I like baking.
In Ukraine, it is traditional to have chandeliers, locusts, and others.
I don't have favorites, I like to try a variety of dishes in different countries.
How do you like your food?
I want to be busy.
More specifically, there is a train, and there are no places.
Sorry, we're a little late.
Lucia, can I have an assistant to the kitchen?
It is a good thing that Julia has the opportunity to go to work.
I went to their apartment last night.
It's very noticeable and comfortable.
On Tuesday, Pablo will tell me if there will be a job for Nazar at the brewery and when he has to come to arrange a meeting.
If Nazar works at 5:30, he can use any train:
Zelenski: Mariupol – the heart of war, will stop fighting – we will have weak positions
President Vladimir Zelenski believes that fighting east of Ukraine and especially beyond Mariupol will determine the course of war - and if the USSR is defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and reoccupy the occupied territories.
The real language is, you know, the heart of this war today.
It's fighting, we're fighting, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have a weaker position.
They (the city's defenders) are people who have taken on a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupola, the stronger our position will be in the eastern state, in the (area) OOS, and if they are stronger, then the victory table will be closer to us and we will have the advantage of dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, we can not wait to meet.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to the cities that we have just purchased.
They can go for that.
Then our situation in the talks will be weaker and perhaps not even interested in the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we find out.
We believe in our outcome, our victory..."
Details: Zelenski also said that going to negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians is difficult, but "we should not lose the possibility of a diplomatic solution if we have them."
The language is, "People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, the conditions of independence of Ukraine, but... every family has lost something, and I don't think any peace will satisfy them on any condition.
But if we do not speak emotionally, the war must end in peace, or millions of victims will end.
And even where there are a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight — but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing left, there's no people."
Good afternoon, do you still have seats available for the Czech course for adults since 19:00 on Tuesday?
If you wish, you can meet your family in Kutno Gore.
And these two are my cousins.
Yeah, I get it.
I'm not sure I'll be able to clean up until 1:00 because there's a big apartment and a lot of cleaning.
I'll try to clean up quickly, but I won't.
I'll write to you when the apartment is ready for guests.
Dominic, who's doing the purchase of the materials?
This is a permanent procedure, is it necessary to order as far as the end is concerned?
Because of the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts have become needed to describe its new quality state.
It's the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the state study.
Ukraine’s poetic metaphor in modern literature allows for analysis of postmodern context as one where metaphor plays an axiological role
Do you know how to report online that I've done my job and that I'm no longer trying to help?
I don't have the ability to go in person.
You don't know when you can live there?
Do you have a basket? We'd like to ask for Sunday for the Passover.
You don't get tired of him.
Don't translate the topic I'm now asking you directly Do you want to keep talking if you don't write to me already
Therefore, we go to work and the cost of living
On Monday, we'll have a leader and we'll decide how and when we'll be in it.
'Cause I'm starting to get a little cranky that I don't understand and that's not where I'm going.
I think it's the right decision, it's better to give these people quality help than when many people do.
My 16-year-old daughter and I are looking for a temporary refuge in the Czech Republic, where my daughter plans to study at the University.
At least now we've seen each other, and the conversation is more like correspondence, but it's not bad either.

I'm an Oxana. I'm a theatre critic and teacher at the university. I'm also an expert at the Ukrainian Cultural Fund and an expert at the theatre festival.
My husband's a athlete. He's a tourist. He's my son.
I can help clean things up.
Drive or not, you just had to understand me.

Then I will load through Ukraine through my VPN
So I'm looking for an accountant, but while I'm learning the language, I can do some administrative work.
I realize they're not gonna take me to the company right now to work as an accountant.
When a child has a birthday, does he bring juice or fruit for the entire class, something for all children?
Of course we can come, thank you!
5. In addition to the Czech language courses, what kind of education would you like for yourself?
How hard is it?
In Ukraine, mobile operators work 24 hours a day on a telephone or online basis, regardless of holidays :)
I'm going to work tomorrow morning around 6:00 to 6:20. I'll be home after lunch.
If you have time, we'll try to change the tariff plan tomorrow night.
But today our city was bombed again, and I fear for my son.
And I want to get out of here as soon as possible.
I don't get it.
Dear Brother Albert, my family and I are grateful for your support and for the gift you have given us!
Thank you from the heart.
With respect, the family of the Unbeliever.
All right, thanks for talking, I'm gonna take a pill and go to bed and have a good night's sleep.
My name is Ciara, I'm from Ukraine, I'm with her daughter, she's seven years old, and she's with her mother.
I'm looking for a job... but there's a problem, I can't stay on my feet long after the surgery, and it's really hard to find something that's right for me.
I am temporarily living in Prague 9. Ready to move anywhere if there is a job.I will be very grateful for the suggestions or suggestions.)
But if you don't want to talk to me, I miss you.
Why did you believe that you did not need such an experience?
Each situation is given for something.
Most of the time, a person needs to change, especially spiritually.
I'll give you the money as the bank approves.
About 30,000 grand in debt, which you have plus 30,000 grand to keep.
Janka, I hope you're all right, and your grandmother won't call me bad words.
I'm trying to get Sasha to sleep... so he can get some sleep....

Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence’s Chief Department of Intelligence published a list of Russian military personnel involved in war crimes in the Butch Kyiv region.
According to Ukraine’s Department of Defense Intelligence, this is reported in Facebook.
"Every Ukrainian must know their names!
GUAR MO Ukraine has acquired a list of 64 military personnel of a separate motorist brigade who are directly involved in war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha," says the report.
IN THE U.S.R.M.O., the U.S.U. notes that all war criminals will be brought to justice and brought to justice for crimes committed against the Ukrainian civilian population.
The list can be viewed by reference.
According to Ukraine, Irpin, Butch, Gostomel, and the entire Kiev area were freed from Russian invaders.
Freed cities and villages have recorded mass killings by Russian military civilians.
On April 1, Butchi Anatoly Fedoruk’s city head reported that 280 people were buried in brotherly graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venedictov stated that 410 bodies of civilians were exported on April 3 from the Russian invaders of the territory of Kiev.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the start of a full-scale invasion into Ukraine.
The troops of Russian invaders are firing and destroying key infrastructures, firing massive shells at residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, reactive fire systems, ballistic missiles, airbombs.
Hello, I'm sorry, but I can't work for you because I'm going to go to Canada soon.
Immediately behind the dash are formal names, behind the bar there are slang expressions at risk, in the parentheses, the shortcuts used on the schedule of hours.
I don't want to bother you. Rest.
I was looking at the weather forecast.
I don't need a brandy.
Just nice clothes at normal prices and to be sized.
We were at the railway station in the store.
The professions offered.
It's important, if there's such a tradition, I need to know that I'm prepared.)
I was thinking in a week, but we're having a rough time, sirens.
Tomorrow might be a bad connection on the road.
I thank every person for his experience, even if he is in pain.
I think I've learned from every situation for myself not to make mistakes again.
The directives are made in the form of numbered written supplements that are part of this Rules.
I'm sure that won't be a problem.
In Ukraine, many people are celebrating the same way this week.
It depends on religion.
Whether there's a Greek Catholic or a Catholic.
At first, you can try it for free.
Maybe you'll write us a pay algorithm, we'll pay for it.
We have the paper that kids get at the end of the school year, and we get a witness at birth and we get married.
Yes, he's on it as an experienced driver, but I don't know if it's any better.
It says here that we need to fill in the script, in the Czech...
I'll try to make it, 'cause I'm still in town to sign the papers.
My wife doesn't mind you being on the phone.
In my daily prayers, I thank God and the Virgin for you.
Let them wrap you up with their cover of love and warmth this night.
My heart belongs to you.
Do you mind if I come right after the war?
place, day and time will be specified according to interests and possibilities
We promised that if you went to school, we'd give you a surprise.
I've got two months of rent money in Olomouc, the area doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal abuse of civilians north of Kiev.
The photos of people who had been rolled and shot have confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people question each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?!
I was not surprised at all, but it was exactly what I had been waiting for.
I took the children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girl coworker with the kids, and only then came back to the capital to work.
Since 2014, he has consistently helped the USSR, and he has not doubted for a moment that in the event of occupation, my family will be spared the suburbs of Kiev.
Because I was and remain absolutely certain that the essence of the rotten communist-KDBS regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937 one of my great-grandfathers was shot in the prison of Zitomir.
A few years ago, a copy of the granddaddy’s shooting case was removed in the U.S.S.R. — more than a hundred pages, and the execution sentence is much simpler and even more frightening.
The accused was illiterate, denied the offence.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, a poor "one-two" road, never walked in a fortress.
The fact that they lived on tents and had several cows was sufficient to anoint the chalice and feeder of young children to death.
The parents did not even know about the burial place.
Grandma said that the village then took nearly a hundred people and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
There's a name in the criminal case for a Shari knocker.
Our former Speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics, and I won't be surprised if it was his relative who was the KGB's informant.
An apple from an apple is known to fall...
The shooting trinity that led to the execution of the peasants was ethnic Russians.
As he analyzed his great - grandfather’s case, he was interested in various information resources.
There are great (no sarcasm) information resources in Russia, like "The Undead Barrack", which are very good at reminding us of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NCCDs found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
The people who found the mass graves of the victims of the Stalinic repression and publicly wrote the names of the murderers, the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It's like they found files with child pornography on the computer, they put her in jail, and she died fast.
The KDBS are now being killed by those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the last century.
Why are you suddenly surprised at their actions now?!
The most disgusting traits of human nature are concentrated there.
The surface of the thousand-year ordinal tradition was the enslavement and imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries.
And then on what went on, they did a beastly genetic experiment, cutting out intelligence in a few waves of red terror.
Look at the 1992 Czech half-French movie, that's what happened.
Why did you see my pictures in the bathroom?
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from cough.
I'm sorry, I have no one to ask.
I still wanted to ask you maybe you know where the kids went, because gala can't mean them.
Igor asks if you are comfortable to drive tomorrow? (He is on the weekend and can leave because the car is not yet seen at the station).
We don't feel comfortable bothering you that much.
You are very helpful, thank you!

Your coffee's coming today.
I have my first bike after my son.
When girls return from school, what do they do?
We came to a place where we were housed from the center in Pardubice, conditions are good.
But there's a big but here men live like drinking alcohol and smoking in the room, loud music is the minimum that "dumbled", the smell of cigarettes by drunk men and me and the kids... are going to sleep terribly if you're honest.
Please help with the quarters, please.
But where it'll be safe and not smoked.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is like they're smoking right here.
I'm asking you very much, one of them barely stands on his feet, something screams, something he doesn't like.
I'm just begging if you can help.
What's important is that we understand each other.
Very positive, such a beautiful garden, such pleasant educators.
You do so much for us, it's incredibly, very grateful to you
Good evening Stephanie, Agatha wants to participate in the game, she missed the game
We're not getting through to that hatch.
So far we're not ready to pay that kind of money, we'll wait for help, and then we'll plan something.
How am I supposed to get to the apartment today to clean up?
If I'm at the main entrance, should I let you know, and you will?
I wanted to see if I could get a look at Carina's cake.
I forgot to write you, I'm sorry.
It went very well yesterday.
We talked about children with special needs you and their learning system in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shahova introduced me as a worker of the Fpoint, the first question was how the dog was found, as the mops found.
Everyone's watching the Facebook page.
They asked me to give you a greeting and to say that they were very interested in reading the news.
They were also talking about people of Roma nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if the child and the parents didn't understand Czech at all, then after work I could help them with the phone mode.
I need to change my bed linen, two sets.
That's what makes me happy on the holidays.
I have free time, and we only attend grand ceremonies.
Thank you. I'll write my work data today.
The data is very good, thanks for the organization.
So in Nestor so far only a snorkel and in Galinka a temperature of 37.7 dinners 38
General Chapeke's going there very slowly.
Everyone has a chance.
The important thing is that love is real and mutual.
I don't know how in Europe, but in our country, people get married for a variety of reasons, usually useful, mercantile goals.
And I have a problem with that if I don't love someone, it won't work.
Yeah, we took her home and took her right away.
She thanked me very much, and she was crying.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
She had tears in her eyes.
She said if it was possible there might be some old blanket and pillow.
But it doesn't have to be, only if it does.
I felt sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.
I had many questions about God, why there were situations in my life that made me lose everything.
I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you made the congregations.
That's true, but we don't know where we are yet, and we don't know where we are today. We've been looking for an hour and we've been walking back.
Even now, I've been thinking about you, and you wrote to me.
Does your dad only speak Russian or any other family member?
Kids can come to Wala and play in the lobby.
All right, let's take a risk.
It's nice to meet you, too.
For the living room talking to Volodymyr advised me whether to stare while they find or find themselves saying here that the lady who lives with us is that we need to drive to the subway museum there is an institution that helps us find a place to live
I'll cross the barrier for the little one.
I don't know the answers to some of their questions.
That would be good for Thursday, if you could.
I can't call the doctor because I haven't done a food license test yet.
But I can't call him because I ran out of money.
I can't fill the phone because I don't understand it in the Czech online banking and the Ukrainian bank card doesn't fill.
In the plugin, I can't even change the fare so I have normal calls and the Internet doesn't fill the number.
I'm going crazy.
Where the face isn't, the face... the title doesn't sound right what you mean?
I'm ashamed to be out of work.
I just wrote that at school
I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm really worried.
But that's closer than they're going to leave Ukraine to know exactly what they're going to get.
Because it's where it's always been.
Yeah, it's 10-11 years old, but our size doesn't match.
I'm looking for everything for home and children.
Thanks to the people, I'm alive in a chapel, and they're always pushing or needing château, and I'm ashamed to say I'm asking to find myself.
I just got home, and now I'm having breakfast:)
Please don't explain, please, that I'm not here.
could not respond without a summary sent
Mom, I can't say that.
And I'm a little freaked out right now that I couldn't keep myself from feeling before we left the apartment... like tonight...
Give Jura God a night’s sleep, and then I will lie down for a while.
I'll write you anyway.
Hi. Susana, help me. I've got a payment for March. It's for me and Julia, or just me, I can't figure out why.
Yes, you can make copies of your passports when you're comfortable :)
We have one of the best flyers in the area in the village.
I'm having fun talking to you, and I like it.
I turned to caritas, and they offered a temporary housing for a week or two, but I need a permanent home where I could be with a child, and why there was less and less.
The flowers were on. Everything was fine. Everyone was more relaxed and very beautiful.
According to the European Truth report, this is what Welt writes with reference to sources in the government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, an appropriate proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economics on Saturday.
The cost of 100 sponges, including the teaching kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As well as proposed Howitzers in the 1.2 billion-euro A.T.R. Boxer.
While tanks in combat have to climb relatively close to the targets of the opponent, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire more than 30 kilometers [30 km] away.
According to the Ukrainian government circles with a reference to the KMW proposal, the supply of self-propelled hoods will follow a circular scheme.
The bunker will give Kiev 100 of its sponges in the shortest term, and the gaps created will then be filled with industry at the second stage.
The first new Howitzers can be placed 30 months after the contract was signed, the former half of 2024.
Full supply will not be completed until 2027.
Is this us in the morning or the afternoon together?
Thank you so much, we'll find a way to fill in the breadsticks and tosses, and I'll write you back.
I'm going to work tomorrow without going to the commission, and then when my doctor gets better, I'm going to go through the commission, right?
How am I supposed to change my T-mobile fare to 4 gigabytes for 249 crowns?
Hi, I'm sorry. Do you want a job?

I'm young and active, 21 years old.
I'll agree to any job.
I speak Czech at the base level, but I learn every day, so I think I'll learn everything I need to work without any problems.
I told you today, you must be sleeping to work tomorrow.
If I may, I'll take these pants for work.
You are smart and everything will be fine.

So we wanted to solve the issue with the Easter card. We don't have an Internet-banking, we don't know how to figure it out. What do we have to do?

Say goodbye whenever you walk.
Yeah, we can do it after 17 hours.
Can I wash my underwear in the apartment tomorrow and put it in the garage?
Yeah, I'll be waiting for you at 6:00.
How Much I Learned in This Specialty
If it were warm, it would be very good.
I made an online application, and I'm going to try to get off after work today.
We're doing fine. We're doing fine. We've got a history of gas in Ukraine, but since it's very expensive, we've been melting the stove with wood.

Thanks, 'cause we don't really have much work going on here.
And we've even got the fish.
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
I didn't understand Czech that well at the time.
I must have thought of something.
Right, and they go to school so three because Gala and Svoslav are learning remotely to graduate from the Ukrainian school and to get a certificate of completion in the fall they have to go to college.
Can you tell me how to get to the center of town?
I'll share my thoughts with you.
To me, marriage is the mystery of two people who do not discuss each other with their family or friends.
A man and a woman decide their own questions in their family, especially without family involvement.
Can We Be Together?
It'll take some time before we're around.
Why don't we try it this way for now?
I rented a car for nine people, we'll come with Mariana and your family.

I didn't know even big stores would be closed.

The branch office in Hall No. 29 is specially designed for the filing and processing of requests for assistance, so there is a translator on site.
Lydia has already been brought to school, but because of the illness we're going to go to school on Tuesday, I told her today.
I sit, I keep earphones, I listen to music, and I think about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, my love, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I feel like we're together, that we're a couple.
I'd say there'd be a lot of work to do after the war.
So I'm not afraid I'll find her there.
I know a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into one of them.
I just don't know what's going to happen to the apartment.
I have to go through the food license testing.
Please tell me you have five guests to prepare the apartment tomorrow.
Is that the fifth place I understand in the room with the TV?
Deploy and seal the couch?
Can we stop at your place while Mrs. Margarita finds us a place to live?
Don't worry about it.
It's not a new one that's been used, but it's a work thing, but it's not needed.
Write an address in Czech, let's see where it is from us.
I don't know how much free space there is, so I can't plan anything with furniture I want this week to finally look at that apartment and then figure out what furniture I need.
I'm sorry it's been so long, it's been a working day, it's hard to adapt.
That's enough for now?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, to have that opportunity to embrace you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell you how it feels.
For the baby, there's a bed and a bath, so I found it for the first time.
Do not forget that you promised to help me how you would be able, but not the last time you gave up
I want to do a strip called a hat.
Oleg's sick--feeling sick and coughing.
Only I'll be a little bit later, about 8:00, can I?
I don't want any misunderstandings with you.
Because I'm worried everything's gonna be okay!
Because we didn't even talk about it with these excarcerations!
I understand how important this is to you!
And I'm not talking about myself.
How do you feel today?
Hi, I'm sorry, I just woke up, I had a bad night.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was saddened that yesterday Kolya and I began translating the test poorly.
I'm going to ask whether Gregory Denisenko or Jonashek) is going to help me with any mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can be useful to them?
If that's possible, I'd like to raise the mathematical terms for the weekend.
Geometry is hard at all, but we have to work with the Wheel so that there are no mistakes.
Thank you for your test assignments.
We hope so, too.
So she's very happy with any gift.
Jab wanted to connect the Internet to his Czech issue
Yesterday at the 402nd bus stop, I met Ukrainian Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have an agreement that we will be friends.
And last night, I thank God for this girl, because she's the first person in Ukraine to feel my heart's reciprocity.
The branch office in Hall No. 29 is dedicated to the filing and processing of requests for assistance
Showed up. I ordered a spare card.
You don't have to. I'm just a human being.
So she wouldn't be afraid that no one would come.
I didn't go, but I did, and I did, and it's my fault that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
Six months ago, at the Holocaust Memorial Center Babin Yar in Kiev, we honored 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yar.
I had the privilege of speaking after three heads of state, including the president of Germany.
He spoke of "the common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their way and life in territorial integrity, peaceful and secure Europe.
This is also part of our responsibility in connection with our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in a new dress," he said, "then for us Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight must last."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, starved the inhabitants of its cities, and caused them to die from disease.
Russian troops carry out massive shootings of Ukrainians, even visually similar to the shootings in Baba’s Yar.
For over a month, the Germans see it in real-time news.
Yes, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, as well as weapons that have not been imagined so long ago.
Germany is delaying the shipment of heavy arms needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means more than taking a stand against swastika.
This means fighting all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way without the risks and casualties of defeating evil and stopping atrocities in Ukraine.

Sergey Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against NATO entry, and only 18% of those surveyed spoke for.
After the Dignity Revolution, the escape of Viktor Januković, the annexation of Crimea and the start of the war, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and the number of supporters, on the contrary, grew.
Following the start of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists have established a record level of support for Ukraine's accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens -- over 75%.
Despite Ukraine's support for NATO accession and the assistance that NATO is providing in terms of war, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and the members of the country, for the timely supply of arms, the refusal to shut the sky, the reluctance to irritate Russia.
In addition, there is a high risk that Ukraine will have to give up its desire for membership in the Alliance through the position of the F, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will have reliable security assurances, including military guarantees.
In the new episode of "Cursed Questions" together with the editor of "European Truth", we are talking about how Ukraine's Alliance has helped since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance has been criticized in vain, why our prospects for NATO membership are as close as ever in history and why the security assurances discussed in the talks with Russia can become the second Budapest memorandum.
What do you think this is?
I have a partner in my volt that's what my application is for.
I put it in because of this mobile app.
There are no visas, we need to go to the convention center and find out how to do it, because it was designed in Poland, and the visas were not given, but they gave a song.
We'll write to you!
Dennis left in a good mood today.
He arranged to meet a boy from Ukraine who met him at school yesterday to show him everything.
So I hope he's okay.
Because that's not how I like it, that's how long I'm gonna be.
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks to Ukraine and infantry fighting machines
I'm going to leave the kids alone and wait there for three or four years, and I'm going home because I can't leave anymore.
And take with you 6-7 a.m.
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had genuine feelings for this man, but he did not do the right thing and I left him.
After a while he returned and apologized to me.
I refused.
Then, after a while, he telephoned that he had a heart operation.
I asked him to talk to me, and I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost six months.
During that time, we had much communication.
I started having problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought, maybe you should take a different look at him.
And he offered to marry me, and two days later he died.
So God has determined our destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for you to marry?
And he only speaks Czech.
I wanted to say that I was able to find a place to live, and I am very happy to have a place to live, and I have a place to stay.
Should I have mentioned it before?
Because I helped see the kids in the family.
Don't apologize, just write some sentences I don't understand.
I myself understand that the translator does not always correctly translate the text
I don't know how to talk to a doctor. Is it supposed to give paper?

That's very nice of you, thank you.
You're making me feel better.
All right, give me something else, or I don't sleep, I still fall asleep, and I dream about being bombed...
God is never late, all his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me:)
I understand very well the value of unskilled work, and I realize that the kind of work I had at home in Kiev I can't have here and the money I earned at home, and I'm not getting here either.
But I just can't sit around and do anything, because then every bad thing in my head is going to have to do something physical.
At the airport, documents are made from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and at another time, you can simply wait.

I'm sorry, I really don't have missed calls from Wednesday.
I propose work, bath and toilet cleaning, washing 3 windows, dusting.

The Russian army threatens to launch rocket attacks on Kiev, saying, "We haven't done that before."
Conashchenkova's direct language: "We see attempts at diversions and the task of strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects in the area of the RF.
If such incidents continue, the armed forces of the RF will strike at decision-making centres, including Kiev, from which the Russian army had previously held back."
The Russians launched rocket attacks on Kiev during the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation forces into Ukraine.
On February 25, a remnant of Russian rockets that crashed the Ukrainian PPO system crashed into a large apartment building on the city’s Poznaki.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a multi-story avenue on Wallery Lobanovsky.
On March 1st, the Russians hit the TV station near Baba Jar, killing five passersby.
On March 2, Ukraine’s PPO systems hit the southern railway station with Russian rockets flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defence.
On March 14, a wreck of a wrecked invader rocket smashed a house and a trolleybus on Kurenovac, Kiev
On March 18, a Russian rocket struck a residential building on Winogradar, killing one person, and wounding 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian rockets destroyed modern Retroville TRC in Vingoradara, killing at least four people.
On April 13th, Mer Kiev Vitaly Klitchko claimed that the people of the capital who had evacuated from the city had to return too early.
The army explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still strike at Kiev with rockets, and there were also many mines and unexploded ammunition in the capital.
Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense’s chief intelligence office warned on April 12 that the Russians were planning to take the lead in a number of terrorist attacks in the RF territory to accuse Ukrainians and justify the atrocities of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1 near Bilgorod in Russia, oil bases appeared to have exploded as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local government of Bilgorod claimed that a Ukrainian projectile had fallen near the city.
Apparently, both in Washington and Berlin, the elite are throwing cold sweat at the thought that the Nazi exterminators will be beating down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelenski speaks not as much to them as to their voters and communities in general.
By his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that none of his predecessors were available.
Zelenski does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine; he convinces the European peoples who choose them.
And these talks, this fine alloy of strength, touchiness and despair, gradually reach their goal.
As long as the same Biden strongly opposes the closure of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens are already supporting this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is opposed to speeding up Ukraine’s entry, the process is already under way.
I understand you, so I don't want to be viewed as a fraud.
The cost you collect is better given to those who need it more.
I can come to you and decide where you are.
But the air is clean, it's plus

I don't understand the fare.

But I won't stop loving you, you're everything to me.
That's what the financial consultant does.

Contact: ------I'd like a letter so that Czechs can write to you through a translator, SMS doesn't go here, they don't have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they call you, don't go home.
You really don't want that ticket?
It helps people to see what they are worth and what they have to do with it.
If you don't want a first letter, I won't have it.
Tell yourself how you want it, and I'll do it.
By the way, you didn't want to write to me today... something.
Don't worry, I didn't come to ask for anything.
More specifically, today all I'm asking for is attention.
I have a lot to say today, so I'm asking you for more patience.
Are you all right with your imagination?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan shopping, vacations.
You have dreams.
You plan on buying that dress you saw yesterday at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can't accept that.
He's clinging to the old reality.
You call work, you find out, you go out today or you don't.
You decide to leave your children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There's hope... it's not long.
Now... we make a deal... something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where do I go? I don't have anybody, and I don't have anywhere.
I've got $50 in my pocket, everything we spent at home.
Many of our leaders have not paid their wages on our jobs.
Where am I supposed to go?
You don't have the ability to take many things.
You didn't take anything from home... you drive 1,000 kilometers.
You don't know what to feed tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to night, you drag kids all over Prague.
I don't know how many kids ask for sweets, and you can't.
And from every last one of them, we don't have that.
We have a choice to stay there and call the kids to safety, or try to get out here.
She was very happy with those hearts and the things that the kids gave her when she came to school.
I had to call me when you got here.
I'll write to you in dinner.
Yes, only in God do I believe and believe in my life
I don't have the strength to do this anymore.
I thought you were in love with some Ukrainian girl and you don't have time to talk.
On the menu I figured it out, I even ordered it.
2. Would you be interested in sharing with your Czech neighbors, friends, community?
If so, what kind of species.
Please send a visa page or a visa seal (red with a date).
Without a visa for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian assistance.
Mrs. Libusche, did you pay for the veggies?
Because I don't understand.
You're doing us so much good...
We owe you a great debt... thank you!
Yes, I understand it's very good.
Now I'm going to take your picture of the lady I'm teaching you in English.
Well, if you write tomorrow, meet me or not, maybe your plans will change...
Good morning. We have enough resources. It's so good to know a man from Ukraine.
If you want, you can be with me after work.
Aren't you busy tomorrow?
What a total impression you have from the first week
Karina brought us medicine the other day, and we're drinking it.
I can work with lying sick and disabled children
But you have to say that I only speak Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have that.
I can wash your soap for last night.
Because there's only an antibacterial gel.
I'm not saying exactly, because I'm not really in the city yet... half past 12
What services/activities do you think are needed/are needed for older people?
I don't know, because there was no text from the bank yet, and I didn't get the bank card and the kids took the bank app out and they made me very upset.
Then please write to me how you're going to drive.
Today we have the joy of our city, Butch, freed from the invaders, spared our armies.
It's coming from the enemy -- they're looking for Russians in basements and apartments.
The whole city is being replaced, the swapping work is about to begin.

Our Panas wants to stay home, says that he is tired of us and wants to be alone when we go away without him.

They were small entrepreneurs who opened up volunteer headquarters in their homes and shops.
They're tractors, actually under fire, going into the field, because it's time to shine.
These are bus drivers who today agree to drive in the rubber bands to temporarily occupied areas to take help and people from there.
These are heroic leaders who are fearlessly going to combat zones, calming down and helping refugees in wagons, and helping volunteers to get into humanitarian cars at peaceful stations.
These were the auto-drives on the Lifetime Route in the early days of the war and patiently served the frightened and nervous people.
These are the utility companies who take out the garbage under fire, repair the plumbing, and the power lines to provide the people with the necessary equipment.
They are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day, not complaining about anything, but volunteering at leisure, collecting pharmacies at the front.
We have in Ukraine, no more juice when there are little leaves.)
Please, little kids-- what age do you mean?
My daughter is eight years old, is that age acceptable?
I'm looking for an apartment for me and my daughter for 3-4 days every time I come to the Czech Republic and hand over passports for a visa to Canada.
In Warsaw, there's a lot of people at the visa center, and it doesn't work on-line.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's a long way away, it's a long way along the train, it's gonna be hard for the baby.
So I decided to search for a house in Prague or not.
No, we're fine.

The Czech Republic began issuing visas after March 22th, according to me.
Until then, they were stamped like that, and then they compared these images to visas.
Ukraine’s foreign electoral district (U.S.O.) is an electoral district that unites electoral sites located outside Ukraine and consists of polling facilities in the embassies and consulates of Ukraine and military bases abroad.[Vinosca 1] where Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo) are located.[1][1] The role of the District Election Commission for the Foreign Electoral District is carried out by the Central Election Commission.
Only state-level ballots are held in the foreign constituency: the election of the President and the national deputies and all-Ukraine referendums.
Local elections are not held.
They're at the train station near the mother and child's room.

I don't need money anymore. I borrowed money from a friend for a long time.
I wanted to say that I've already plugged in the Czech mobile number.
I didn't need another device to do that, so I went to the O2 operator and they gave me an electronic SIM map that I plugged into my phone, so I don't need another device.
I'm very uncomfortable, Sunday's working, and I can't do it anymore.
You said you had a broken washing machine.
We don't have the blankets, the shower blankets, the plates. The kids don't have pajamas, and there's nothing to worry about.
Good morning, at 10 o'clock I'll be leaving... write the address again, there's a missing text.
I don't want to torture you or myself, I'm gonna end up with this.
That would be a good thing, but I know there weren't any seats available, and in principle, they have all the classes now on schedule and they're teaching pretty well.

Very tasty apples, what is that sort of apple?
President Andrey Jermak's chief of office has informed us that Russia is launching a "feick operation" on the weapons that allied us are handing over.
He said, "They understand that they're losing the war, they see their backwardness, and they want to beat down the arms supply by any means they can.
For example, one of the last fairies is the bucimous destruction passed on by Slovakia by the SRC C-300.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What's going to happen next, we know the scenarios of the Russians, I'll name one of them.
They can launch fairy tales that Ukrainian soldiers huddle with arms from allies, and they move massively into the arms of the Russian army.
I want to warn them right away.
Because the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the U.S.S.A. exclusively send an enemy to that world.
I'm sorry, I forgot to ask how many boulevards cost a garden in a month and will it work in the summer?

Good day Victor approved this house just doesn't know how to help this gentleman with documents to get paid by the state and say that with a furniture bank there's no furniture available yet.
But I'm very grateful for the hospitality in your session.
We have good doctors here, too.

I'll take the underwear for a fifth guest, and the pillow and the blanket are extra in the apartment?
Yes, but how to contact the owners, no contact, I need a long-term housing we're working and we can pay, help me if you can.
At the end of each description you have contact with the owner.
You can use this online translator from English to English and vice versa to communicate.
I'll have any, like, four of us in one bed in a room where we can't even get around, thank you very much.
Well, did you click on the links I sent you above?
Each of them has a free offer of housing, a description, a contact with the owner and a photo.
I can't contact just an e-mail, but I'm not getting any closer to Czech Krumlov, and we're living in Prague right now.
Then I won't help you.
Thanks for your help, we found a place to live, but we need a bed and a sofa, so maybe you can show us where you can buy it, because we have a low budget, thank you very much.

We cleaned the whole room and moved into the other room.
The international community continues to express shock and indignation after the emergence of evidence that Russian forces committed atrocities against the peaceful population in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected these reports as “provocation”.
"The reports of the murdered, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops of Ukrainian civilians are worth condemning," New Zealand Prime Minister Jasinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4th.
"Russia must answer to the world for what they have done," she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kisida called the incidents “a violation of international law”.
Statements were made after reports of hundreds of civilians being shot and thrown into brotherly graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Butchi by Russian troops leaving the area after occupying the area for several weeks.
Photographs, which allegedly depicted the bodies of the executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the guilty.
French President Emmanuel Macron stated in a radio interview on April 4th that Russian troops committed war crimes in Butch.
"What happened in Butchi requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed towards Russian exports of coal and oil.
The prime minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez, said that the Russian forces could go so far as to make the genocide in Butch.
"We will do all we can to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished," Sánchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on public television late on April 3rd, Russia’s Mary Zacharova, a spokesman, rejected the accusation as a “provocation”.
Without evidence, she stated that the United States and NATO had “ordered” images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first moments after these materials were made does not raise any doubts about who "ordered" this story," said Zacharova.
Earlier, Russia’s Mine Defense also claimed, without evidence, that the image of Butchi was "another piece of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30th.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to gather on April 4 to discuss what it called "the provocation of the Ukrainian radicals" in Buch.
The following committee of Russia issued a statement on April 4 in which he announced the "investigation" of Ukraine's "certainly false information" on the Russian forces' actions in Butchi.
Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenski spoke on April 3th, accusing the Russian forces of committing “genocide” in the city and telling the Kremlin leaders that they should come to Butchi to see what their military did.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are carried out," Zelenski said in the video, turning from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there's a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shooting in the back of the head," he said.
He stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian military officers should be responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
"When we find people tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don't understand," he said of the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Butchi, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
Radio Freedom correspondent on April 2 saw a small city of a civilian body on the streets.
In one place alone, a reporter saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists have seen at least 21 bodies in different places in Butchi.
The bodies of one group of nine -- all civilian -- were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to locals, was used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims appear to have been killed from a nearby distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities stated that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the Kiev area, which was controlled by Russian troops prior to last week.
Thank you, it's all there, we bought everything on the list.
"They said, 'Kieva is gone.' As the invaders carried the Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus, undergroundly.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robbery, rape, murder, torture.
There is another point in this list, which is currently much less information -- the export of the local population to the enemy's territory.
About mid-March, Ukrainian invaders "evacuate" Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements into their territory and the territory of Belarus, which self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually placed under the Russian military range.
Ukrainian Truth has been searching for the Ukrainians and their relatives to see how the same evacuation is happening and if there are any ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The characters of this text agreed to voluntary forced evacuation beyond Ukraine under psychological pressure and from the abyss.
Thankfully, they're alive and in touch with their families.
However, in view of the claims made by the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe coercion.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the second maternity home, took the children out of there without their parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the dead Ukrainian champion from the swimming of Joseph Zachepinsky.
Alexander's family, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter, Wally, moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at Antonov Airport, which is two and a half miles [2.5 km] from the village.
The family settled in a military town, even though it was a civilian.
Like the real slabs, Dennis and Marina picked up the disturbing suitcases in advance, but in the morning of February 24, they didn't make it.
They didn't have their own car, and the suburban buses didn't take anyone anymore.
About 12 o'clock on February 24th, they saw helicopters with Latin V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a nearby house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17th, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"On the 6th night of February 24th, people entered the driveway, who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They say, "Who's there?" I say, "Go out!"
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, if there was a weapon.
All men were questioned as to whether they were serving in the army.
They said to the women, "We have come to protect you according to Ramzan Kadirov's instructions."
It was Chechnya's OMON, not even an army, young boys 25-35 years old.
They said, "That's what the Ukrainians helped us with in the war, Sasko White (commanded by the UNA-UNSO Viking nationalist movement, which fought on the side of Chechens in the first Russian-Czech war -- UP), now we're here to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we needed.
We say that the water, with it, was a big problem.
They broke down the store, took the goods from there under the "always the Russians will take" and brought us six bottles.
There's still a video on the Internet where kids thank Kadir for the food.
So they brought a sausage after the shop was robbed and they said, "We understand it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmadovich."
No one particularly wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our kid says, "You have seven days to give us our phones," they laughed.
They still separated themselves from the Russians.
They said it was good that they came, because they didn't want wars, they support Ukrainians, and they're good at it, and they're good at it, and they're bad, and they're bad, but we can't do anything, because there's our families.
And mostly they weren't fighting, they were driving shops, looting.
The chickens were tied up, one tied to one leg of the Georgia ribbon, and the other to their white Scotch and called it the armor.
They came to Ukraine completely unprepared.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... when they were beaten in Butchi, so they didn't even take the dead, they said, "Do you have any artillery?"
Moreover, the Chechens did not know each other, and in the first days, they asked for passwords to reveal their own or their own.
We had them until March 13th, followed by the Russian OMON, followed by the men's landing.
They put 30-40 units of technology between the houses -- ours kept coming from the Bayractors.
But these came and told us that the CSA was gone, but there's an Azov, and they said, "Azova" is that thousands of 100 in Ukraine.
Narrator: "Kiyev has surrendered" since the beginning of March.
On one occasion, a Russian officer, or a member of the FSB, came to us and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio -- it was about Butch, Hostomel, and we thought maybe the Green Corridor was given to us.
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, and they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're being transported to Belarus, and then maybe Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
And they said, "Well, pity the psyche of your children."
How it worked, they chased us into the basement and started shooting from under the house, or the castles, or the mortars.
And then it flew back... the neighbors just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct hit on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to pass on to the border guards and the Red Cross.
The part didn't go, saying it was for the traitors of the homeland, saying, "You're going to get shot there, you're going to get sold."
We were taken across Chernobyl, on both sides of the road by burning fires, broken equipment, although the Belarusians told us that the Russians were moving technology right next to them.
There's a lot of dignitaries, buried tech, and soldiers.
At the Belarusian launch point of the mosquito, we had improvised control, many of whom were without documents at all, because they were burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, and we were given tea.
And here we hear gunshots, firing a rocket, and you can see that it's what Iskander was doing on Kiev.
Even though those of the Belarusian Red Cross said, "Oh, no, these planes are flying, they're turning abroad."
But we're from aviation, we have education, we know that's what it is.
Then we were loaded onto a bus and taken to the Chanky sanatorium near Gomel.
His manager, Wenger Vasil Stepanovich, came and said, "Here I am, hochol, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not be stopped until these thieves get here.
The poor people are suffering!
And we got Lukashenko so good!
As he will say, it will be."
They offered to interview Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The sanatorium administration told us, "You're traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the United Nations (at least they were called) were spreading disinformation that men could not travel to Poland.
Many believed it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents, our daughter had no foreign passport.
We had to receive it on Monday, and Thursday the war began.
In the U.K. Consulate, we were given no help, and in Minsk, a train station told us that no one would take a bus without passports.
Here I'm going to say we've had a lot of help from Belarusian volunteers.
We were placed in Minsk, and we were escorted.
There was no force in the sanatorium.
To our second group, the migration representative said that you could live here for a week or a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there's no payout here.
We found an internal carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
As we traveled near Mozir (about 50 km from Ukraine’s borders – UP), we saw ballistic missiles launched in Ukraine: the missile first takes off, bright lights, and then fires.
The people who boarded a bus in Mozir were told that the Russians were constantly shooting the polygons.
But I can tell you that Belarusians don't want to fight at all.
The generals are freed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something if she was summoned.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk is, does not believe at all.
They say, "You lie, we are a peaceful people."
They do not realize that their ranges are used to shoot Ukraine.
In Poland we had friends who had taken us to Estonia.
Now we're going through registration, we're going to decide what to do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are now probably as much as Estonian flags."
Marina lived in a military town in Gostomel with her brother's family, his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the necessary items and documents.
At night they went to the basement of the next house.
Marina herself couldn't come home, and in principle she can't, the house is gone.
Nobody really knew about the evacuation.
Can't you get somewhere downtown on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything. And we're always waiting for you at the guest's.

On April 1st, Butchi Anatoly Fedoruk's city head reported a joyful message: the Ukrainian military on March 31st freed the city from Russian invaders.
The next day, the invaders were thrown out of all of Kiev.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians would have felt at that time was overshadowed by horror and hatred, for it was also known that only Butchi had the Russians shot at at least 280 civilians.
They were killed on the street, and some were tied up and shot in the back, some of them killed, they were minors.
Killed and followed by torture, they found the mayor of the village of Motyzhin Olga Suchenko, her husband, Igorus, and Alexander’s son, who were abducted on March 23.
Olga and Alexander were in their brotherly graves, Igorus in the sewers.
Both routes 20 km from Kiev revealed the bodies of a number of naked women wrapped in blankets.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go home, no one will.

And I'm worried about her because she's not at home, she's in another country that's not exactly familiar with the state.

President Vladimir Zelenski stated that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners had come too late.
That's what he said in an Associated Press interview published by the President's Office, it says, "European Truth."
"All the equipment, all they're sending, for some kind of equipment it's too late.
So what if, for example, we're talking about Mariupolo, when you're losing thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
On the question of that, that's enough weapons Ukraine got to make a difference in war, the president said, "No, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine were a NATO member, it would not be this war, or it would look different.
"She would've turned around differently, we'd have close neighbors, we could've fought together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be any wars," he added.
Let us recall, the prime minister of Great Britain has promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armoury and anti-ship weapons.

A new girl from Ukraine appeared in the garden today
I didn't even touch the door, and it's ringing.
If I understood the Director correctly, he said that if I worked in the garden, I could come to work some day for as many hours as I could get.
If that's the case, then I'll be able, for example, to go to work a few days a week for a few hours.
For how many hours and what days I'm going to watch myself go out to be fashionable and to clean apartments, there's more to be paid for cleaning, so I don't want to give up that job.

He was a very wealthy man, and some time later he called and told him that he had had a heart operation.
He asked me just to talk to him and to support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and thought that I might be his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer.
"There was a car standing in my yard, a crocodile like that, and she was putting her breasts up.
And they kept me in the house, and then they took me to the basement, and there were, like, 400 people out there, nothing to breathe.
And what about the apartment that you dropped the photo?
I haven't really gotten there yet.
The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has already refuted this faik.
I'll watch the last two videos when the Internet works.
Is there a jersey on the job or not, or can you walk in what you have?
All right, he's gonna come over there and pick them up.
I'm not thirsty for anything.
I realize I can't sit with you. I have to work.
Thank you, but we don't need 1+1 and actually Ukrainian television.
I see all the news on the Internet.
And 1 + 1 is the Presidential, Propagandist channel, not interesting to me at all.
What happened there at the stop with the man that the police and the ambulance came?
Diana didn't answer to me, and you didn't.
All right, all I need to do is print out the paintings for the kids, so it's gonna be okay.
But you may need a more detailed knowledge of Czech.
I'm here to make sure you're happy with my work.
In this case, I know a girl who's Ukrainian, but she's studying in the Czech Republic, for tourism.
You really don't want to come with the kids for a minute, calmly and with Grandma.
I want you to be with me, wake up next to you.
In fact, it is hard to live in a foreign land, and every day, it is becoming more and more desirable to go home.
Mrs. Agatha, if you need this photo, I'll take a picture.
Thank you for trying to make our lives here as best possible.
I'll remember you for life.
And I'm going to remember and smile
So thank you, Annie. She's still setting up a geolocation route on the phone so we can get there soon.
I have to pay the fare, I have to control it.

How am I supposed to pay?
"I tell her that TV and radio repairs have been extended through the import details, and friends and acquaintances have been warned not to make any extra noise when they call."
"We've been hiding Info's mother-in-law from the war for a month.
So far, it's working.
However, the Plumki (cat-UP) on the puddle and the hind paws licked fur – it could be from stress, change in food and vitamin deficiency.
The last two reasons have been removed, and here's the stress that doesn't depend on me, unfortunately.
The bottle, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears sirens and explosions."
Because of what Olga hears and spends most of her time in her room, her bride-moon lived in an apartment with her incognito.
And on April 1st, 93-year-old Oksana Polov took up arms for the first time in her life.
"33 days I lived with her in my apartment as a guerrilla.
War was hidden from her, and the fact that I was near was a formal occurrence for several hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her the receiver, and she listened for four hours, and then she sang for two hours."
The receiver was always at the bedside.
Most of the time the mother-in-law spends in his room.
She's hearing bad -- it allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her walkers, I was hiding in my room.
At first, the receiver and the television were hidden from her.
Then she called everyone who talked to her.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning and to the end.
It's April 17th -- I've got two flats cleaning:)
Good evening, I didn't think about it.
Hey, if we need more help tomorrow, we can come.
Is it necessary to order lunch from the house? These documents need to be printed or printed there and I'll sign them?
I suggest a man's haircut, a woman's, a child's ride to you, all the people on board please write in a personal report, the price:
I understand and I'm not complaining, but in my situation, I'm looking here.
I'm telling you the embassy is just here,
A British man who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the U.S.S.U. says he's ready to surrender to the Russians.
A British man who is a member of the Marine Corps, the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who is involved in the defense of Mariupola, told his friends and family that they would make up their weapons and surrender to the Russian invaders.
Source: Twitter page by Adine Aslin, a British man who has served in the USSR since 2018, BC with links to family and friends of Aslin, Atlas News, with a reference to the words of his friend Aslin, who spoke to him
We got a message from him, "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything we can to protect Marieupolis, but we don't have a choice, except for the surrender to the Russian forces.
We didn't have any food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope the war is over soon."
Details: Aislin served in the 36th Marine Corps's 36th Marine Corps, which participates in Mariupol's defense operation.
Air Force journalists contacted the mother of military officer Ann Wood, and she confirmed that her son had informed her that they were planning to surrender.
A friend of the military, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to the journalists that in his last telephone conversation, Eislin had said about the plans of their capitulation unit.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Atlas News reporters contacted his friend, who said that the Aslin unit is about to be taken into custody by Russian troops, so that they don't get caught without guns and bullets in the hands of so-called caddies.
The social media also spread a recording of a telephone conversation that seemed to be talking to a familiar American friend who was planning to travel to Ukraine.
In his conversation, Aislin said that they were trying to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
The British once told him that Instagram was threatened by a private military company called Wagner.
Eislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to fight against terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the LAG and took an oath.
Asla’s friends and loved ones called Johnny, and in social media he is more known under the nowhere-old Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I'd like to know whether we're together or not.
But it won't be easy, you'll have to find him...
You offered to go with you, I agreed if everything was okay.
Thank you for doing so much for us. Thank you very much.
If you don't want to write to me again, I'll wait.
Hi, Natalie, please, pour the flowers outside, by the front door.
I'd like to learn Czech too.

The climate is almost the same.
My family's fine, I have a mother, three brothers, and a husband.
One brother for the wars in Mariupola, the other in Zaporozhye, and the man from Kiev today was transferred to Harkow.
They call every day saying everything's fine, and who knows him, they won't tell the truth anyway.
I wanted to come to you, but she wanted to handle some other things.
I'll ask my husband in the morning if he'll make it tomorrow.
When you get home, please write to me. I'd have to talk to Daniel.
The Dwarves for their loss in battle have all played out.
A teacher named Dmitry Pavlicsky was shot, and his unknown relative, a young man named Boris Alexienka, was shot.
Their bodies were thrown into a “deep washbasin, which they have sunk with the earth”.
“ There was some sort of dead silence in the city, ” according to memories.
In rare cases, one of the inhabitants ran from house to house.
In the streets, the bodies were always seen by the Bolsheviks rolled up
And maybe I'll go after you, I need you, I can't go without you.
3. Which activity/activity of yours would help you or your friends better adapt to living in the Czech Republic?
But you're not gonna make it, because there's a reconstruction of the Iron Road and the West is closed.
You get to the bridge where the reconstruction is, you tell me we're here, and I'll come to you.

Okay, I'll definitely ask him.
As soon as we're done tomorrow night, I'll pick it up and I'll pick it up on Tuesday.
I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us, because that was the last hope, the truth.
I am not afraid of work, as I have lived in the village, so I can and love to work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
You have a very interesting tradition, we go to Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved Bill 7176, which is called "To monitor potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere."
Surprisingly, the only potential threat to Ukraine's national security in the field of economics has proved to be... the place behind which the members of the supervisory board are meeting.
The initiators of the bill believe that making decisions by the supervisory board of the state-run Kyiv can somehow solve Ukraine’s national security problems.
We know that there are many new dangers for the companies, but until we know that no company has been required to conduct physical meetings of the oversight board at the location.
The potential threat posed by such a law was understood to be an excellent basis for "sufficient" all acquisitions in the difficult reform of enterprises after the Declaration of Dignity, including independent oversight boards, and then to establish manual management.
The same as before 2015.
Why should the servitude of the Watch Tower Society be extended to the Watch Tower Society, and who should be included in the Watch Tower Society?
What's more, if one harmful piece of legislation takes off under the patriotic slogans, another might fly tomorrow - for example, the state procurement system via ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Many things can be written into war.
By the way, this initiative came before the beginning of the war and the bill 7176.
So on February 22, this rule was introduced into a comparative table of bill 5397.
In general, the desire to open up oversight councils has been circulating among some of the national constituencies for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but for the possible consequences of the bill, we will consider the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we're going to make our own proposals on how to solve the issue of managing a state-owned enterprise during the war.
The First Deputy Minister of Economics, Denis Kudin, explained the need for such innovations by the risk of loss of the Internet and other means of communication, which would make it impossible for the oversight boards to operate remotely.
In other words, the risk is that the board of supervisors will not be able to make the necessary decisions, which could paralyze the company's work.
We agree that such a risk is, but can it prevent him from moving members of the oversight board to Ukraine?
Let us imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the oversight boards (which make up the majority of them) place their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In that case, according to the bill, they could be released.
And then it's likely to lead to the loss of the quorum, the need for an oversight council to make any decision.
Instead, it would not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the Supervisory Board, since the law foresees the need for a competitive selection that takes on average 3-4 months.
So the proposed legislative decision 7,176 is likely to prevent a loss by the board of oversight from making decisions, and the opposite is the case!
People’s MP, author of Dmitry Nataluh’s bill, gives other arguments for his support.
In particular, he notes: "many businesses, especially the defence and industrial complex (OPC), now need locations," and so "it's hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna to Zoom."
To begin with, there are almost no IPC companies in Ukraine that have oversight boards.
The Supervisory Board is except in the Ukro-Bronprom, which basically manages almost all OPC companies.
But even in the Ukro-banprom, according to the legislation, the board's oversight has a rather limited mandate, and all its members are carrying out duties not free of charge.
All the power in the Ukrobarrom is owned by the Director General, who will, by the way, decide on the need for a relocation of an OPC company that is part of a concert.
Moreover, such an argument does not stand in the way of criticism, since Bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation governing the activities of OPC companies at all.
Mr. Dmitri on his Facebook page also cites arguments that can be applied to the category "emotional."
Such arguments generally have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of the work of the companies and the banks, but let's try to figure out some of them: "the distinguished foreign experts at the first word of war" leave Ukraine in 2021, but they remain members of the supervisory board in the state enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary in several hundred thousand dollars, while Ukraine itself actually suffers from war."
First of all, this is manipulation -- most of these members of the oversight boards never lived in Ukraine, and only occasionally came here.
So to say that they're leaving Ukraine, that's not fair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the oversight board have long been involved in the practice of holding online meetings.
It is a tool that has long been widely used in world practice, in very different fields: business, education, medicine, and so on.
Nor should we forget that membership in the oversight council is not a full-time job.
Usually, people like that have a different job, and it's the electronics that help them do it.
Third, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmitri does not make identical claims to the members of the oversight councils that are Ukrainians.
Because they're not at the location of their companies either.
To put it, this is not the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from oversight councils, and war is just a new convenient opportunity.
Hi, I'm in Ukraine looking for possible options for temporary family shelter, and I'm with two children.

Yes, I understand what I have to do.

We usually need one of the adults' passports.
In Brovarsky, Vyshgrad, and Buchansk district of Kiev, who were freed from occupation, they will set up a two - day high curfew.
Pavluk’s direct language: “In the populated areas of Brovarsky, Vishgrad and Buchansk regions under Russian occupation and liberated by the Ukrainian defence forces, the curfew is reinforced!
On the territory of these cities and villages the restrictions will operate from 21:00 on April 2 until 06:00 on April 5th."
Details: At this time, according to the head of the siege, it is strictly forbidden to travel on the streets of the population and in other public places, by transport and by foot.
Residents can only go out on the street at the time of the alarm to get into hiding.
Such restrictions are put in place to remove the effects of Russian aggression -- to clean up and demarcate the territories.
The omelian girl urged the people who had left the area to stay away from returning home.
In the rest of Kiev, the curfew will last from 21:00 to 6:00 a.m. every day.

Following full-scale aggression by the RF against Ukraine, the Western countries have taken the prospect of possible worsening in the Balkans very seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is getting more complicated and globalized.

The Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians for 27 and 28 years, associated with the destruction of two relay lockers of a signal station under Osipovici, which provides for the movement of railways.
Source: Freedom Radio, Spring Justice Center, Head of the Criminal Police Department, Gennadi Kazakovic, quoted by Belta State Information Agency
The USS of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30th, three residents of Bobruysk were detained, one injured.
According to News, the men in custody were actively resisting and trying to escape.
The security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were provided medical care on the spot.
The Chief of Criminal Police of the Ministry of the Interior of Belarus, Gennadi Kazakević, stated that "the acts of terrorism on RB railways will be severely halted" by the use of weapons.
On April 6th, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another partner of the Belarusian railway, a co-worker of the Baranovice Department of BJD, and the administrator of the BZD thematic resources in the "Vkontattie and "One Classes" of Valentin Samasuka.
Where he is now and where he is unknown, @belzhd_live reports.
At the end of March, at least 40 railways were detained for diversion in Belarus.
Let's remind ourselves: Bypol formation, declared by Lukashenko's regime, continues to call on Belarusians to create diversions on the rail transport and infrastructure of Belarus as part of the victory plan.
Belarus's "Ray guerrillas" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
It is known that, through Belarus, the RF is transferring living power and technology into Ukraine to fight.
It's for self-esteem.

United States bans investment in the RF and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, is launching new sanctions against the daughters of President Putin, the largest banks of the RF Alpha Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
That's what this is all about on the White House website.
Sberbank is Russia's largest financial institution, owned by the government, and Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the U.S. financial system and ban U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
The U.S. will also introduce a complete ban on new investment in the RF.
To this end, U.S. President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investment in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their whereabouts.
"This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
The output of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as legal and consulting firms," says the White House statement.
The third step in new sanctions from the United States was to limit large Russian state companies to critical areas.
This will ban U.S. citizens from doing operations with these organizations and freeze any of their assets within the jurisdiction of the United States.
The detailed list of Minfin will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is to block the assets of the full-age children of Putin, the wife and daughter of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lavrov, as well as members of the Security Council of Russia, including the president and prime minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev and Prime Minister Michael Misustin.
Sanctions cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze any assets they have in the United States.

So we hope for the very first time that someone will take us in) We can even pay for a room or an apartment, but if that's in our pocket.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We have no harmful habits.
We will be grateful for such help in such an unforgivable time.
After lunch, I had a lecture in English and then went to work in the children’s room.
There I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understands everything and does it well.
And I also met Ms. Lena and she talked about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an announcement from the pool.
It's free swimming.
You can call the school, Kira doesn't pick up the phone, she doesn't answer, I don't know if she went to school.
They isolate the Russian office: stop the investment and stop the supply.
But we didn't understand.
The military didn't stifle in our house.
Our home is near the military and the oil base
He just helped me because I couldn't do it myself.
I cook well, I don’t ask for too much, and I give good advice
I'm doing my best.
It's kind of hard for me, but I realize I have to go through this stage.
I'll meet you on Thursday and I'll tell you everything.
It's all good.
I like how often you clean.
I clean every week.
I'm afraid there's no program, but I'll try to figure it out.
I had a dream of being a teacher.
My girls can't move now, so I didn't write to the owner of the house.
I wanted to ask you to let me know if you heard any information about this place.
I would be happy to rent a house with some decent girl.
If you know one, let me know.
On my own, I'm not cheating.
Thanks in advance.
I haven't written you another person, Natalie 54 years old. Please write down the exact address and how much the rates are.
I think you better make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I didn't change my name, it's one of my births:)
I'm sorry, I'll do it and send it to you right away.
We're going to the med committee right now.
I mean, we don't have to work that hour another day.
What day should she come sooner? (Maybe on what day is a little more work?)
I'll listen tomorrow, the Internet's not working well.
You're lucky what you're gonna do.
Thank you... they found something out of things, but there was nothing from technology...
We both know nothing but the alphabet.
Nothing's happening.
May I see Monday, 25.04.?
You can take the kids with you, the toy here is enough:)
I guessed about Dad.
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'll think of something with this money.
We'll do it sometime.
But how will this be paid, please, no credit.
Write it to me straight, and I'll help you.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
Should we take with us the clothes they gave?
It's not my day. It's my day. It's my living room.
Something came from you, I can't see
I'm very sad too.
I'll remind you of the invoice later.
You're the only one who talks and understands Russian?
What day does a colleague want to do the cleaning of the house, and how many houses have windows?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can't help but share with you.
I advise you to read Joe Dispensa, he's doing scientific research on the impact of external factors and the formation of new neurons.
Natalia Nagorna, a television journalist, released a video on April 12th, which was handed to her by the 36th Marine Corps of Mariupol.
In it, military officials say that they have no weapons left to engage in battles and the mountain of the wounded.
They said, "account goes for hours."
Before that, on April 11th, 36th, a separate Marine Corps brigade, which is involved in the defence of Mariupola, issued a call to the Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement stated that April 11th could become the final battle for the supporters of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command had not been linked to the fighters for two weeks.
Squeps were expressed in social media that the application was published in Russian.
The commander-in-chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces, Valérie Proslavny, has assured us that the link between command and defence forces in Mariupola is, and the details of the defence operation should not be discussed in public.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters in the territory of the Austal factory in Mariupoli and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian invaders dropped a toxic substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
According to Azova leader Andrey Bielecki, the RF army used chemical weapons over the Austall factory, which was held by the Azov regiment fighters.
Thank you, I'll adjust to you.
The situation is the same as we're staying here.
2 hours drive )) walks, mom shopping and back)!
It's not important.
She forgot what she was gonna do here.
The Czech drone squadron began flying over Ukraine from now on.
Almost 50 professional phonographs will be used for detection, and some of them will be used for the immediate destruction of an enemy invader.
Two Zacarpathic and two Czech brothers “birds” were sent to Ukraine yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukacai Missage, Volodymira Labutenko.
Today, their intercom friends led by the village council manager and coordinator, https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Basil Stur, were delivered by the drones at the destination: they were received by special divisions of the Ukrainian troops in various cities, where fighting is currently taking place.
To make the most of the efficient and safe use of Coptics, their locations will be kept secret at the moment.
Four friends who help the Czech army to stop at what they have done say they are sending many more interesting "gifts" to Ukraine to destroy the Russian invader and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I like sweet, but I can do without it.
I'm worried we won't make it.
Soon to return to Ukraine, to continue to work
If it's all right, I agree.
I'll do my own thing, but if there's a problem, I'll write to you, if I may?
The Key to Understanding One Another
We were personally in the old lady in the village of Jiv, she saw me and that I was pregnant but said there was no place to live.
Maybe she'll be happy and her mood will rise.
My phone was repaired today.
And I think I'm frozen on the street today.
I've had medication and tea, and I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm sorry, too, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.
When you have time, throw me the music you like.
I want to know how much music you have.
Mom and Dad Need to Listen
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's wheel.
It was colder and rained here today, and it's supposed to be warm tomorrow.
But it's no harm to the ruined houses, the damage to the people who are being abused by the invaders.
In Herson, the invaders from the "Slav Ukraine" memorial in Herson on the street of Perkopsky.
Details: The unknown have been reported to have ripped off the flag of the European Union, destroyed the panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundreds and the dead in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers took away the portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly 100th and the dead participants in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They took out the flag.
Good morning, thank you kids for Christmas Christmas, we don't have that custom, so we didn't know, they only gave children chocolate and cookies, maybe something else needed to be given.
In Czech there's someone to talk to, if anything.
'Cause I live in a kind of dormitory until twelve people are here, and then they go to work.
Hi, it's a little better.
He was already in a manger today.
Even today I've slept there.
That is why we are making great progress.
I'll definitely bring the weeds another time!
I don't have the strength to do them.
Since I am pushed away from the days and times in which the cleaning work is done after the guests, I can say about April month because I already have an approximate cleaning schedule.
For May, the month -- I can tell you about the end of April or the beginning of May.
I just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hi, I'm sorry I didn't write off the dinner and got some sleep.
If you don't mind, can I come tonight?)
or I'll meet you after you get here)
He's been studying a lot lately.
Hello) everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to be working with people in such a high position.
Today, she had a lesson from a lady who is the head of the economics department at the height.
She was very pleased with my work.
A manger in a manger behaved well.
On Monday, I have to get confirmation of the employment and cash payments for the ova.
I've been moaning since Friday.
I don't do anything but a lot to them and sleep (and drink a lot of water)
If you're going to the doctor tomorrow, I'll go with you, if you don't mind.
I've got another test to run.
You don't have to go again.
It works very badly, it washes away, it needs a master, it needs to be fixed.
That's all there is to it.
Can you send me the correct email address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language you signed up for.
And do children feed there or do they have to bring them with them?
Now there's one question I can ask you for a moment.
If you still need help, write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating the Passover today, right?
From the start, we didn't want you to raise money so that people wouldn't think we were speculating on it!
But for online filling, I didn't have enough two points:
I'm going to go to bed, get some strength and energy, thank you for the present.
So this is a great idea, and now I'm going to watch this video, and it's going to be good, because the whole family is going to draw.
The University of Karazin urges workers and students to scrutinize all information, not to trust anonymous sources in messenders and social networks, rumours and gossip.
Focus only on official information.
So you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, is also helping the army.
I've got some portfolio work to do.
They're supposed to do the Internet after the holidays.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How do they tell me the day I wasn't at work is a vacation?
Headquarters: Russia prepares provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army can use provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against the neighbouring state".
"It is not ruled out that the Russian Federation's military forces carry out provocative actions in the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring state."
Details: The Adversary continues to create an offensive group of troops for action in the Slobodan direction.
Likely, in the coming days, the invaders will try to reinvigorate the attack.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and dispatch special forces, weapons, and equipment to engage in hostilities in Ukraine’s territory.
We are preparing weapons and military equipment at the site of the 60th Special Motorway Brigade (Monasteryste) of the 5th Eastern Military Army Army Army.
It is likely that the designated weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied area of the Donetsk region.
Also in order to restore the loss of the special composition of the battalion tactical group from the 36th individual motorist brigade (Borzia, Zabajkali Region) to the 29th General Army of the Eastern Military District, a number of military personnel from the designated brigade are being deployed.
A particular problem the enemy feels when he assembles the driver and driver's mechanics.
The collection of the selected special composition from the permanent location is scheduled for the second half of April of this year.
Likely, an opponent to disrupt cargo delivery to combat sites will continue to strike on transport infrastructure facilities in Ukraine to destroy them or to remove them from the system.
The designated armed forces of Belarus continue to carry out the task of strengthening the Ukrainian-Bilarus border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobodan direction, separate troops from the 6th general army and the coast forces of the northern fleet continue to block the city of Harkov, and artillery fires continue to take place in separate areas of the city.
In the direction of Izum, there is an aerial survey of the area to identify the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
The enemy uses the Orlan-10 BPLA to do that.
By force of the two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to advance in the direction of the long and Dmitrovka population points, having failed and moved to a previously occupied position.
In the Donetsk direction, the main effort continues to focus on the control of the population points Dangerous, Ruby, Lower and NovoBakhmutwa, as well as the establishment of full control of the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to storm the Golden District, and he was unsuccessful.
In the city of Mariupol, the invaders continue to storm the areas of the Austal factory and the seaport by means of artillery and aviation.
By the power of individual units, the enemy fired artillery shells at the positions of the Ukrainian troops in the areas of the populated areas of the Highpail, the Trudolovka and the Mariana.
In the territory of Donetské and Lugansk region, four enemy attacks, five tanks, eight armed units, six vehicles, and eight artillery systems of the enemy were shot down.
Don't you understand what you're saying?
We'll certainly try to make it, but I doubt it.
How could you want to sleep and I'm holding you up?
You sure you don't mind if I come?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, so tell me, I'll understand.)
We didn't watch TV at home or more than 1+1.
I'm gonna turn on the TV just to listen to Czech.
I'm finishing today's fare package for the month :)
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, ditch, thread for embroidery
I understand, so I can prepare the material in this area.
I'll ask her, I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she gives us a lot of pies.
I'll see my father later, I'm sure.
I read an ad in Facebook, so maybe Google wrote something his own way. I think the phone number's enough.
Good afternoon, we're the things you brought, but are there things for us little ones you can bring them to you in 10 minutes?
I've been thinking about doing some work.
If Mrs. Director makes arrangements, I can start work the following week because tomorrow I plan to go to the office to submit papers (if it works, because it's very big queues) and on Saturday to rain :)
I'm looking for a brigade at the beginning, I was very fond of chemistry at school, I'm studying Czech to know perfectly, I'm dreaming of working on TV.
Friends of old and not very old, friends with whom I do not personally know, friends of spirit and mind.
Now you too have had a difficult time.
During the last month, I have been associating with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy before, has turned from one’s feet to another, as has every Ukrainian’s life.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have confessed that they feel guilt and shame over the actions of your country in relation to your neighbors.
Because of why they're giving in to Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have been in danger for a long time, and you are preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote Alexander Cercasov, my very old friend from the Memorial.
I'll tell you a little later, as usual, Sasha responded in a concise manner. "Now, after the search, we're going through the ruins.
Others are cultural actors, artists, critics, writers, amazed at the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: with the exception of very few of you — those who worked in the Memorial, in the New York News, in Echo Moscow, in Medusa, in the Naval organization and in a bunch of other places — have many of you done anything to contradict this regime?
Except that they're in the rally, when they're still going on.
Also read a column of Russian journalist "It's late to hide, it's late to keep quiet."
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long - term indifference to what is going on around you, your apathy and your passive cooperation, which are now likely to be a heavy burden on your soul and heart?
That was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period of time when you had freedom and democracy to some extent, even a bloody one, but a real one.
But 1991 turned out to be no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up in such a fear of sadness that you're looking for salvation behind the King's back, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still feel safer with him.
True, mistakes were made.
Instead of grabbing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did in the Stasi, you took the soul on the Deerinsky Memorial -- and allowed the KGB to lay to the bottom, upgrade, transform, and seize power over the country.
When you were put before the election between the robbery of the country and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the third option, and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell, and this meant the end of mass rallies for great social justice or war in Chechnya.
Survival has been a major concern.
Then Putin showed up, young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but either you voted for it or you preferred not to vote at all.
When he rebalanced Chechnya with the earth, most of you closed their eyes.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya at the time, helping those affected by the Putinian "anti-terrorist operation", and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurty, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I went back to Moscow and had a good time hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the tortures of civilians, the murders of children, the soldiers who sold the bodies to their families.
You said to me, "Brad, we're sick of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
And I said, "Friends, this isn't my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It's your authority to bomb one of your cities, kill your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise in the middle of zero, caused by rising oil prices and Putin's willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the money stolen would remain in the middle class pockets.
Many of you have made a good living, some have made a fortune, and even the poorest of you have bought a new home and found a better job.
Prices grew, and is that a disaster?
Moscow shone and fell from its hips.
When several opponents were killed – Yuri Szczekochyin, Anna Politkowski, Alexander Litvinenko, and others – many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what had happened.
However, there was no further action.
When Putin handed over President Medvedev's post after two terms, and he sat down as Prime Minister, you hardly noticed it, I see.
After a few months of Medvedev Russia’s invasion of Georgia, most of you ignored or kept quiet.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Goodauri, in the suburbs of Kazbeki or in the cafes and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit, we hardly did much in the West if we did anything at all.
A little indignation, some sanctions; but what was the significance of Russia’s flagrant violation of international law when Russian oil, gas, and the internal market were so tempted?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the heavy 1990s, that was the most important thing.
But by the end of 2011, my Russian friends had woken up.
When Putin switched places again with Medvedev and sat down the President's chair, as before, many of you decided it was too much, and you went on a massive protest.
Nabal's name became so famous, you didn't leave the streets for six months, and the regime finally felt terrible that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back.
Initially, alternative actions were organized, more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands are behind bars.
Some have had huge deadlines.
"And what could we do?"
I've heard it so often and I can still hear it.
"The country is so strong and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Enraged by the President of Russia, who has deceived their European expectations, they once captured Majdan -- and never left him again.
They built their own tent town and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police arrived and tried to destroy him, they began to defend themselves with sticks, armatories, and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protesters were attacked.
Many died, but they won.
The fugitive became Janukovich, and the Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to choose their own leaders, and expel them if they do their part badly.
Majdan did not like Putin very much.
This was a bad example.
So, using the general confusion, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were opposed, but there are few benefits.
How thrilled you were!
As far as I know, 91 percent of the citizens of Russia have supported the annexation.
Suddenly, a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his neck suddenly returned to the 180 degrees Fahrenheit [180 ° C] and worshipped him.
I find it difficult to find a reason, since right after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends remained largely silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you've been hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogues and parks, just like the new ones after the restoration that Moscow's mayors started in 2012, with their binge, the popular bifay and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's only getting better.
You've barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, weren't there?
IDILE or whatever... even the Moscow editor who released my book on Syria, then criticized it in an interview because I didn't understand much about what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I was driving there and I saw, on the streets of Homs, government snipers shooting at my children's peers in cold blood.
Among all the Russian citizens there were only your soldiers, who began bombing thousands of civilians in 2015, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of pastor Martin Nimeller:
"At first they came for the socialists, but I kept silent because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came for the union members, but I kept quiet because I'm not a union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I kept silent — because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything to my protection."
How many of you were talking about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did.
But the vast majority kept silent.
Some actually speak now — such as Dmitry Glukhovsky, Michael Shishkin, Michael Zigar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
Most allow themselves to speak abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Osynnikov, risking getting into a new GUULAG or forming a company for Navalna.
As for others, you know best what country you live in.
So, I'm sure you understand that when Putin deals with Ukrainians -- or what seems very likely if he doesn't, he'll take you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who courageously but mostly single-handedly went to the protests and still had a minor deadline, but soon received a more serious one.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who said they disagreed in social media (even with a black square in Instagram) or spoke in private conversation with colleagues at work.
At times when 10 or even 25 years of deprivation of liberty were given simply for anecdote, they were not in such a distant past, and now they are very likely to be waiting for you in the future.
Who will then speak for you? Who will remain?
The Ukrainian example -- even more than 2014, -- scares the Putin regime -- proves it can be fought.
And that his mind, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how oppressive his advantage is on the paper.
In view of everything, few in Russia realize it as well as the fact that there is a war in general.
But you, my friends, know very well what's going on.
You read the news abroad on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine that you're in contact with.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be ready.
You know what it's all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence was over.
Your choices are just hochma, your laws, if not repressive, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media is gone, your economy is ruined faster than I am writing, you no longer have credit cards to buy tickets on a plane abroad, even if some flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try it or you'll be crushed.
I doubt you see any other options.
Yet, there is yet another.
Which will eventually break this regime.
And maybe in conditions that have come true, you're going to need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark is not from you: because of the economic collapse that is taking place in Russia, it is likely to burn in the province, in small cities.
When prices go down and wages don't pay, people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will come out on the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, which is you, my friends.
But if each city goes on its own, as has been the case periodically, it will not be difficult to suppress them alone.
We're going to need organization and coordination, and we're going to need to convert the crowd into mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool -- the Internet, which can limit the mode, but which still works, and which can be fixed under almost any circumstances.
The Navalan organization has been destroyed, but it is possible to create other more informal, more decentralized.
There are millions of you.
Moscow police can handle 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If more than 300,000 comes out, she'll be shocked.
We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when he gets to it?
After everything he forced them to do in Ukraine, everything he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel a sense of fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid if I were you.
In the case of Syria and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their host who dares not only to demand freedom but who really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will put a joke in the computer game chat and be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet -- and she will be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes -- and die in a raw cell under police clubs.
That's what's been going on for years -- and it's just going to keep getting bigger and bigger.
So you don't have a choice, if you don't do anything, you know how this ends.
Act coolly, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were in class Friday, told us we could come Monday.
We'll be home in the evening
That you see me as a press secretary
Hey, how often do you go to an expensive restaurant?
Once a mouthful I go to dinner at an expensive restaurant
I try to explain everything to her)
So we liked it very nice and we wanted something brighter so it's a better option.
I was in a room where there were a lot of people, and I got tired of it.
I feel bad, coughing, temperature, voice loss, weakness and headache
I have to go to that government of work
We've already done that, but they said who registered in April will only get the money at the end of the month.
On Thursday, we need a vacation, we're going with the kids to the doctor.
But at night, I had this lady who liked your job, and she wanted something from you in her house.
I'm expecting new news from her, and I'm sure I'll let her know.
When I was working in the D.A., I thought I was building a career, and I spent a lot of time and energy.
I had a complicated psychological, responsible, mental job that I was completely disappointed in.
It's a waste of time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, however, I take my marriage mate seriously.
There was a man I was supposed to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I think that in order to create a family, people have to love, respect, trust each other.
I haven't seen one of these.
Good afternoon. Where in Jephthah can forms be obtained for baking pasta (paper or silicone)?
Okay, thank you for the advice, then I'm going to put a testimonial on Valya.
She's got a D.C.P. in her lying condition, she's now got a leg broken in her plaster, a wheelchair in her lying position, and the food's all over the blender.
Mr. Rayhard, I'm sorry to bother you at any time of the day.
But I have an important question for you.
I went into Natalie's playroom today to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the baby away because she said she came to look at things and lay them down in that room with the clothes and Mr. Valérie opened our nursery yesterday until 7:00.
Could this really be the case?
It's room time until 4:00.
And finally, this is our responsibility.
But I don't have a burden to open a page that's very weak on the Internet.
The car works, the jars are filled yesterday, and I was with the elders before the exam at the high school.
The most difficult thing to do is to get rid of geometry.
On Saturday, Volodymira helped us.
Vica studies universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
Thank you so much for living here.
Yeah, but I thought you didn't fill in.
We'll try to maximize the amount by the end of the week to calculate
The Russian invasion situation is the briefing by Chief of Staff, President Alexius Arestović (10.04.2022)
Director of the Office of Presidential Affairs told of the heroic act of a senior law enforcement officer in Mariupoli -- he was surrounded and wounded, so he blew himself up with a radio station so that she wouldn't get to the enemy.
I have a very important question to ask, will they help me put on my granddaughter's count five years old (a bronchial asthma) now she has a wrinkle and a wheeze...
We need a family doctor for her to understand a little Ukrainian or Russian language.
The doctor’s urgent advice is very concerned about her condition.
We live in Czech Republic Lower Chabri. We need a doctor who's around here in Lower Chabri or somewhere near the maybe Brno but not far from the subway so we can get there.
The butterfly exhibition was very much appreciated.
The butterflies sat on their hands and feet.
