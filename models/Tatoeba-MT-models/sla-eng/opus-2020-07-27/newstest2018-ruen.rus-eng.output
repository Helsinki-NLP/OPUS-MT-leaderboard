President Vladimir Putin of Russia signed the Act imposing administrative responsibility for violations of the terms and conditions of payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for public and municipal purposes.
The Act is designed to address the very acute problem of failure to fulfil its obligations by the contracting authorities in the conduct of public and municipal procurement.
Another two years ago, the situation in which entrepreneurs were unable to obtain payment under public and municipal contracts had been widespread.
At that time, the President of Russia ordered the Office of the Attorney General of the Russian Federation to take the issue for special control.
Because businessmen themselves could not deal with unfaithful customers who had made unfunded contracts, they tried to avoid the obligations they had made and included illegal conditions in contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, 9.7 thousand submissions have been submitted by the Public Prosecutor's Office to protect the rights of entrepreneurs and 4,500 officials have been brought to justice, 533 have been brought to the Office of the Public Prosecutor's Office and 75 files have been submitted to the Public Prosecutor's Office and 46 of them have been prosecuted.
As a result, more than 66 billion roubles were owed to entrepreneurs.
These enormous amounts have not been raised as a result of the non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
Many, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs have resulted in more modest amounts.
This is a typical case.
The manager of a small company won a multimillion roubles social service competition.
Man has invested all of his working capital, has fully fulfilled his obligations, but the money he has not received in due course.
The result is an increasing financial comet of debts on salaries, taxes, loans that would lead to bankruptcy if the enterprise did not seek assistance from the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
The problem has now been maximized in a number of regions.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total public and municipal debt identified by prosecutors in the Russian Federation was around 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the Prosecutor ' s Office operates in manual anti-crisis management.
The Attorney-General personally conducts visiting meetings with local authorities, where all violations revealed by prosecutors and measures to address them immediately are dealt with in detail.
Such operational meetings were already held this year in Jaroslavla and Yekaterinburg.
The implementation of Federal Act No. 189-FZ, amending the Code of Administrative Offences to establish the administrative responsibility of the contracting authorities for breach of the terms and conditions of payment of goods (work, services) in the procurement of public and municipal needs, which was signed by the President of Russia last week, will be qualitatively improved.
The draft law was drafted by the Russian Ministry of Economic Development on the initiative of the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
The new law will complement the Code of Administrative Offences article, which provides for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 rubles for a violation by the employer ' s official of the time and order for payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
If an official has already been subject to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the Russian Federation entities have already been instructed to ensure the implementation of these legislative novelties in practice.
Civil Rights Protection Unit announced a warning on the movement in Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of the Colored Population published a warning for the colorful people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory State policies and racist attacks.
The statement of the group is as follows: “Prevention for travellers of the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of the Colorful People, valid until 28 August 2017, calls on African American Travelers, Guests and Citizens of Missouri to be particularly careful and to exercise increased caution in the travel of the state in connection with a number of suspicious incidents on racist grounds recently occurring throughout the state and brought here”.
According to the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of the Colored People, the group had recently initiated a law in Missouri that made it more difficult for people to win claims of discrimination, as well as the fact that state law enforcement often chose minorities as their targets.
“You are subject to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the road because of the color of their skin, beaten and killed," said Kansas City Star newspaper Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colorful People of Missouri.
“We hear complaints more often than ever.”
This is the first warning of this kind declared by the organization in relation to the state of the United States.
The group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas during a trip to the state, and the Missouri police arrested him without charging him with a crime.
The warning also mentions the recent report by the Attorney General ' s Office of the State of Missouri, which states that the likelihood of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for white drivers.
“To warn people about the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People must be prepared in one way or another, whether they will take the money to bet or inform their relatives that they are travelling through state territory.”
According to the latest data from the FBI programme on hate crimes, there were 100 hate crimes registered in Missouri for 2015, making the state sixteenth in the State in the number of such violations.
The warning of movement is also a response to the new law of Missouri, after which it will be more difficult to bring a case against a legal person in connection with housing or labour discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Protection Union (ACLU) had announced warnings to travellers in Texas and Arizona after the state had passed new immigration control laws, under which local law enforcement authorities had been ordered to arrest people for violations of immigration laws, which, according to ACLU, had to increase the number of checks on racial grounds.
Movement warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people were killed as a result of the shooting of a police patrol in Egypt
Unknown police patrols fired at the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters referred to the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
During the shooting, two people, including one policeman, were killed and three were injured.
All the wounded are taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car and two armed men in the car opened fire on the law enforcement officers.
One of the intruders was detained, the other managed to hide.
Rosturism supports the law on the abolition of free luggage for non-refundable air tickets
The head of Rosturism, Oleg Safonov, stated in an interview with the RBK television channel that “positive” refers to the adoption of a law to abolish the free carriage of luggage in non-returned aircraft.
"It is necessary to create conditions under which a person with no luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one with the luggage," he stressed.
However, Mr. Safonov noted that despite the citizens' concerns, there would be no need to pay for the use of upper clothes and mobile phones in the handrail.
"It is appropriate to calm all our citizens and tourists and to say that it is appropriate to say that it is up to the top, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to the iPad, or even to some computer that no relationship will be made," said the head of Rosturism.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin had signed a law stipulating the right of airlines to exclude the free carriage of luggage in non-refundable air travel.
It is that airlines can determine for themselves the number of seats and the weight of luggage included in the non-refundable tariff.
Vladimir Putin ordered the destruction of Baikal's pollution
Russian President Vladimir Putin reported at a meeting on protection issues in Baikal that significant lake areas have been severely contaminated in recent years.
He commissioned the identification of sources of funding, plans and executioners for the eradication of pollution.
Mr. Putin also commissioned the full recuperation of contaminated territories.
"It is also necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the clean-up of most of them has been carried out," RIA Novosti quoted the President as saying.
He also added that the Russian Attorney-General ' s Office should carry out a test to identify environmentally harmful activities.
He said there were problems in the lake area related to the occurrence of natural landfills and a number of environmental disturbances by recreational organizers.
“I want to emphasize this: not everyone should check in order, but there is a need to know, but that is, illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures,” he stressed.
Previously, the Gen Procurator's Office reported that fish stocks in Lake Baikal had been reduced and proposed an increase in the number of facilities under environmental supervision.
Remember, on 15 June, Vladimir Putin made a direct statement on the need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of a special security regime.
He was informed of economic problems by residents of Olhon Island, which is part of Baikal's natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of the Interior, Sergei Donsky, immediately proposed to resolve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but in the Government of Buratiya, it was recalled that such a change was not sufficient, since restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
In the past, the Ministry of Economics had proposed a solution to the problem by amending the Land Code and the Law on Environmental Protection.
A new temple will appear in Jugre
In the village of Sosiva, members of the community from the indigenous minority peoples of North Rakhtinya, together with the inhabitants of the Beresova region, participate in the construction of an Orthodox temple in honor of the saint Nikolai the Wondermaker.
Its location is the river bank, the temple will be well visible from a distance, so it will serve as a lighthouse for fishermen.
According to community representatives, construction work will be completed this year, and a dome is now in place, and church bells are available.
The Igrimian Navy has been escorted by a transport escort.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Wondermaker, because he reads the Orthodox Church as a patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In the Sausage, the fishing industry gives the settlers a job, feeds them.
Locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children are even writing about it in school forms as a local sight.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why do laws exist in Singapore?
I'm talking to local businessman Chang, sitting in an outdoor diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while the cucumbers are carefully stored in an iron box taken from his office.
After the interview, the businessman goes to the nearest urn, a hundred metres away, and throws the bulls there.
Garbage for garbage in a public place - $500 local dollars, says Chang.
You know, I've been having a reflex since I was a kid: you can't throw a fantasist at a bridge, you're right on edge.
And now there's cameras everywhere.
In fact, Singapore's sidewalks in the center of the city are clean, like in a museum.
Jang says that three months ago, his neighbor's 18-year-old son painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to death.
What?
Imagine that.
He was struck ten times with a wooden stick on the berries and spent a week in prison.
We don't have a lot of corporal punishment.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and extremely harsh laws, the observer of the AIF was dealt with on the spot.
There's no one here to cancel the death penalty, says lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
The Government has long been concerned about both the European Union and the United States.
If a person drives a large shipment of drugs or trades them, he's got a hangover.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport, carrying 400 g of cocaine.
The Australian Prime Minister, threatened by sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope of Rome, defended him.
But the guy was hanged anyway.
After that, our country’s drug addicts are carefully traveling by the side.
The following is the case: Singapore states that laws are bound by the obligation to observe the whole world in a row, not only by the modest and the poor.
No matter who you are, a millionaire, a Vice Prime Minister, a famous artist or a European Union resident.
The option here is, if you find a crack of cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you're walking around Singapore and you're seeing alert dogs all over the place, you're surprised to see how many bans you've made in this city.
For example, the food section is sold only in pharmacies and can be purchased strictly by prescription (!) by a doctor.
The tourist doesn't have the gum on his arrival, but he should stick the rubber on the subway, put a fine of $1000 in the local dollar.
In four days, I met two men with white plates on my neck, "I trashed."
Apart from the fine, cucumbers are often sentenced to “symptoms in palaces” for a week to clean up parks and beaches.
6,000 rubes pay a criminal who forgets to wash the water in a public toilet, and when he tries to make a small need in an apartment elevator, a special detector works, and the doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the most exotic laws - prohibitions on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs, and even excessive flow of room plants (!): it is believed that the water supply attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers cannot be given lighters on the subway, otherwise they are fines for 5,000 Singapore dollars.
Anyway, the idea is, no matter how hard you try, you're bound to break something.
That's not true, he's trying to convince me of Mohammed Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of local tourism.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years, I have not seen anyone being drawn for violating them.
Why do they remain?
So that the citizens don't relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is closely monitored.
Let's say that if a minor is sold cigarettes in a kiosk, they will be punished all over the chain: the shopkeeper will pay a huge price, the intruder himself will get bats on the back and the seller will be expelled and put in jail.
It is precisely because of such severe laws that the offence in Singapore is very rare.
Is this justified?
Back in the '70s, we had chaos on the roads -- motorists ignored traffic lights, drove hotels, sat drunk behind the wheel.
Once the fines were imposed, everything calmed down for a year.
The driver now knows that if they stop, the policeman will not be released for bribes, fine the cost of the apartment and will be sent behind bars for years.
Many foreign nationals of the State in South-East Asia seem to be a variety of concentration camps.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disnayland with the Death Penalty" -- a US guest was horrified by the common wealth of the population, "a frighteningly clean airport" and "cultured nature".
Such things are not natural, they look artificial, and they should not be.
The first days in Singapore, and you're right to throw paper on the sidewalk, you get it when you get on the subway with the ice cream.
But then you come to Little India, and then suddenly, the pattern breakup: the bus stop has plastic cups.
"How's that?" you're surprised.
That's right, the Singaporeans smile.
Everything happens.
Not every such a crime will be taken in place, but you must know that if you are counted, you will not get revenge. You have broken the law.
Most of the time, it's enough for a person to be normal.
Of course, Singapore's power is authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Viet Nam, I moved very carefully — motorcyclists often take smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
In the center of Paris, there are dirty trash and beggars.
In our streets, too, not everyone tries to throw garbage into the urns.
Singapore, on the other hand, has become the most peaceful, clean and secure city on Earth through the recruitment of dragon fines and cruel (up to the death penalty).
You'll think about it.
That's human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one has stuck to the wheel until they get fined.
Although Singapore is not the subject of fines, it is the voluntary enforcement of laws.
And we should think that in Russia, people would like clean streets, no garbage on the subway, and they would welcome the arrest of those who confuse elevators with public toilets.
This is corporal punishment, thank you, don't.
In the rest, Singapore's laws are at least one thing to look out for.
Nothing sacred?
Now the White House of Trump is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he starts fighting statues.
Americans understand this no worse than everyone else - from here deliberately the theatrical demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologies of the Trump Government, no doubt knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic stand over the Statue of Liberty during a bitter dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the President's proposals for a sharp decline in legal migration.
To be honest, Miller didn't try on the statue itself.
The owners of pleasure craft and artists representing the Statue of Liberty would have lynched him if he had tried to do so.
But he tried to make sense of it, especially in the sense attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller went on Acosta: "I don't want to go deep in history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The consolidation you are talking about has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
Miller put the facts right, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
This is about the current sound of Lazarus' striking words, the only ones in which the State invites not all immigrants, but the poorest: “Your tired, your poor, / your crowds, who dream of breathing freely, /The unfortunate wastes of your abundant shores.”
We've never seen "unfortunate discharges" on our screens before.
Miller didn't do literature, and he made it clear in America that Trump wasn't waiting for these people.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute over the meaning of America.
Lazarus — and her friends — struggled to place her words on all the statues after her death — very well understood that they were committing an entirely political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the relationship between the French and American republics by means of a banal classical figure, the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in its poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, with a voice.
And she got a completely different name, the Mother of the Exiles.
The combination of poems and images was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack against American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right at least change it back.
The thunderous Rash Limba, a sort of John the Baptist, who announced the coming of Trump in 2010, reasoned that freedom invites no one, rather than an early neoconservator carrying the flame of America in the dark of the world: “Freedom is moving forward.
It brings a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not need to shed light on the way to the United States."
The custom of Limba really got him to the point.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see it as it would be seen by the impoverished, unhappy but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often heavy voyages.
This means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue answers them with the words of hope and hospitality they desire to hear.
And, of course, it's not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
They need a torch, not to illuminate the way, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their power.
Peace Championship 2017: Neil Blake commends Scottish members of the United Kingdom.
Eileed Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were in the UK.
Neil Blake, director of the Federation of Light Athletics of Great Britain, said that a 16-person Scottish part of the World Cup would make a “significant contribution to the game of the team”.
The record number of Scotland footballers was selected for the London Championship starting on Friday, 2017.
Blake believes that in Scotland, “something special is being born” and that the Federation of Light Athletics of Great Britain should take this into account.
"We know that and we try to understand and support them while they have potential," Blake said.
"I talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's related to what they did.
The Scottish Federation of Light Athletics thinks that with what they've done, we have to work.
The British Federation of Light Athletics: What they have done must be done.
People on the street think the same thing.
I don't know why that happened, but it's brilliant."
Some Scotsmen claim medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bacchert, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at 5,000 metres' distance; and Eilid Doyle's team chose as its captain.
"Alid is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," says Blake.
“Many athletes, whether Scottish or Scottish, have come out of this room from where they live or train, feeling proud and eager to win.
The passions and sincere feelings that Eileed put in her were remarkable."
The owner of the Commonwealth Silver Medal, who will run 400 metres away from the world's fifth World Championship with obstacles, says that 16 Scottishs in a British assembly is "amazing".
The previous record for Scottishs at the world championship was equal to seven in 1983 and 2005.
In advance, Laura Muir, a mid-range runner-up who beat five British and two European records last year.
She'll run 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who will be in the 1,500-millimeter race, is another Scotsman who needs to be brought to his attention: behind him is a good season in which there was victory at the British rally competitions and at the annual competitions.
Doyle remembers his first world champion, when besides her, Lee McConnell was the only Scotsman on the team.
The team captain says she's "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots have not only entered the assembly, but in some cases they'll claim medals and fight to get to the finals.
"Captain selects other team members, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that your friends voted for you and chose you, it's a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scottishs who entered the assembly.
That shows how much we've done.
And they're all going to try to get on the pedestal.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was pretty good.
I was just pointing out that we were very lucky to be home to the World Cup.
So it's just how important it is to get support from the sick people and take advantage of what we're going to be at the Olympic Stadium again.
I got another chance to go out on his arena and participate in the competitions, and the atmosphere there will be just wonderful."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't go public unless you're ready to hear criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what the critical press was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism certainly irritated him.
But he didn't shut his mouth to his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "it's possible to take away freedom of speech from us deaf and dumb will lead like sheep into battle."
Now, I'm going to go to the governor of Maryland Larry Hogan, who should have tried to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates blocked and sterilized the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties brought him to trial.
The defendants of the governor called this action null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "what."
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But that's also important.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is a surprisingly popular Republican governor in a democratic state.
It is second in the approval rating of 50 governors of the country.
Hogan's not a stubborn reagent.
He showed a firm hand in state management and commitment to his principles.
He also has a clever use of Facebook as a primary way of communicating with his voters and with jokes on his website, showing his baldness after chemotherapy his head.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the Governor ' s page - which is declared an official public forum and being held by the taxpayers ' money administration - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In the Washington Post interview, press secretary Amelia Ches defended the Governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was just their moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spamters and haters on the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people that Hogan blocked.
And these are real people, not trolls, - a teacher, a businessman, a pastor who treats their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, meaningful and not harsh.
The pastor quoted the Bible as an appeal that Hogan was a Catholic.
Laxmi Sarm Raman, a lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
“I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news,” she wrote in the section of the comments to the article in Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when many people leave comments on the same subject, some immediately say it's a so-called twist instead of admitting that they're dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
What the governor's subordinates call "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call it "active life."
In the age of Facebook, it is easy to edit your image, simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is much less dusty work than it was when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical protagonists or arresting and arresting protestors.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, only in numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were thrown into his Twitter account.
One of the first decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. district judge from Alexandria, James K. Kesheris, the chairman of the county board of observation, Laudon, violated the First Amendment by throwing a voter into his Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bevinu filed claims against the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties for its behaviour on Facebook and Twitter.
It must not be that difficult.
At the time of Washington, the age of available mail costs was about the same as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers increased fourfold, and the authors of anonymous letters severely undermined its authority.
Even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the alias "Juricola", "Valerius", "Balizarius" and "Portius" wrote letters in newspapers making fun of Washington's decision.
According to historical documents compiled by the George Washington documents online project, his cabinet was petitioned to criticise his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Sailing.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, indifference and speech rests on the very foundation of our State.
And true leadership means agreeing to that.
Ronan Rafferti looks forward to the comforts of the Renaissance Club
The former European champion, Ronan Rafferti, looks forward to home comforts for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lotian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
The native of Northern Ireland, who ran the neighborhood at the Archerfield Links Club and moved towards the final round last year until he lost Paul Ilsa, attached to a new place and played the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarvadi Club.
“I saw the Renaissance Club being built, and we see it coming with success with this event,” Rafferti said.
"The players will see this field at its finest moment, it is in excellent condition.
Jerry did a great job setting this place up.
He's very committed to this game, and he's proud of his achievements here.
This is an excellent demonstration for this field.”
Englishman Ils looks forward to the opportunity to stand for the first time in the championship title, despite the fact that he won both the European tournament and the European Challenge Tour for his 32-year career.
“It’s a really special feeling,” said the player from Southport.
“I couldn’t try to win the Extremadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
To return to this corner of the world is magical.
It's a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a really special time, and we will always remember it.”
He returned to the fight on his native land, Gary Orr, who had joined the European older athletes' tournament after he had completed 50 earlier this year.
The event will be its first public appearance in Scotland with the time of the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“When you play home, it’s always a little bit more important,” said the resident Helensboro Orr.
"You want to do well, but you feel that extra burden."
I was very happy to play again, and I showed a good golf course.
I am pleased with the way things have been done so far.”
In the field, the former Masters winner Ian Wusnem and senior senior champions Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty will join this trio.
Orr and former Captain Ryder Cup Sam Torrans are two of six Scottishs in the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmoire and Ross Drummond.
Take part in the tournament free of charge, and parking costs £5 an hour, if one person is in the car, and £10, if a man is two or more.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Fund.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Custom tunnels over the highways, which can absorb carbon dioxide emitted by cars, are already being tested on British roads.
The country's transport agency, according to the Autocar, reported positive results from tests of a 100-metre tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
A 6-metre tunnel is constructed of some of the latest polymeric materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the extensive measures the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the English intend to expand the power station network, implement a number of road traffic reduction activities, expand the commercial use of electric power and upgrade the heavy truck fleet.
According to official statistics, one quarter of all air pollution is caused by transport, and air quality is the cause of up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorsud changed the punishment of a disabled mother to a fine
Mosgord changed the sentence of a disabled person, Anton Mamaev, who was sentenced to four and a half years in the colony for a fine of 200,000 rubes.
This is reported by TASS.
The Prosecutor ' s Office had previously asked the court to replace the probationary period by explaining its request that Mamaeva’s disease “prohibited her from being in prison”.
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment in a general break-up colony, the victim of which was a former Special Forces fighter.
On 19 July, a court at a visiting meeting in SISO released a man from custody.
Poverty and death in Indonesian “Golden Land”
By preparing lunch, Bardin Degei does not use the stove.
She doesn't even use pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County in the rebel Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply puts a sweet potato, which is called a note, right in the eye.
Half an hour later, a charred tuber is taken and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei is sitting on the ground floor – she has no furniture – and this is where she does her work around the house, such as washing clothes with murky water from a nearby swamp.
The bathroom is a bucket in a room with no roof.
She's the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she wasn't assigned to work in the field.
Multimaritality is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many are drinking, and there are soldiers.
“No one chooses to walk in the village after five evenings,” she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at the daily life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which joined Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by publicly raising their hands in front of the occupying forces.
The current movement, which advocates independence from the Netherlands, quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which retains a strong control over the region without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is the same remote city as the abandoned one; the road here includes a half-hour flight from Jayapura, the provincial administrative center, Nabir, and then a five-hour crash on a rental car.
There's no public transport here.
A city of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses filled with bamboo fences; the roofs of the corned steel are decorated with rust in various shades of red.
Few Indonesians came here, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the pago pagos worshiped a god named Uga Tami.
There have been other changes.
“We were not used to wearing these clothes,” says Degei, pointing to his bright, hand-tipped turban, dark coat, and bright shirt.
“We used to carry only leaves on the body.”
Papua is Indonesia ' s poorest province, 28 per cent of its population lives below the poverty line, and levels of child mortality and literacy among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, belonging to the Phoenix company Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a high-income province about 153,000 people living in New Jersey.
In 2015 alone, Freeport won gold and copper here for about $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua may boast of forests valued at $78 billion.
These wealth, however, brings about one disaster for the popes, guaranteeing that the powerful Indonesian armed forces retain their suffocating presence here.
According to the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local soldiers and units, including $150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of the Papuan threaten the existence of this golden dwelling and are relentlessly being suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 papayas have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, massacres in indigenous residents of Papua Highlands in the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Only last year did the Indonesian police arrest more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything”, the report published in 2016 by the Brisbane diocese contains evidence of atrocities committed in the preceding year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture — especially in other reports, rape and electric shocks — and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to calculate the number of victims because accidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, a research researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Gaukis were prolonged, as Papua ' s resources attracted the influx of displaced persons from other parts of Indonesia.
The province ' s 3.5 million population is 83 per cent Christian, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan laurels, “warunga”, sell roasted chicken and a mixture of gado-gado vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to withstand competition.
“The migrants started selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the natives of Papua,” explains Abette Jou, a twenty-four-year-old native of Paniai, who moved to Jayapur, the province’s administrative centre, because of work.
“As a result, the natives of Papua, Mama (Women) of Papua, lost their marketing market.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo, known as Jokovi, vowed to address inequality and violations of rights in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, a former carpenter obtained support from 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But there was little change in Papua, and locals felt loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokov, waiting for him to fulfill our hopes for justice,” says Jou.
In fact, just two months after the October inaugur, Jokovi Paniai survived a tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children was on the street singing Christmas hymns at the skeleton in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the darkness.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebay, one of the soldiers took offense at their tone and returned after a while with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk were chasing children and beating them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers fired at a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Amos, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a government building near the electoral commission, and the next day the situation worsened.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered in the football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought along ritual hunting bows and filled the watas, the dance of the Papuan tribe of Pago, running round and depicting the birds’ singing.
Some protestors began throwing stones into the police department and military base.
When the situation broke down, internal radio soldiers were ordered “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them”, it sounded like an official document that had been issued by the Time magazine correspondents, but which had not been published in the local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Jeremiah Kaiame, head of the Kego Koto district in Enarotali, felt the danger approaching and called for calmness by asking the crowd to move away from home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I returned, a bullet suddenly struck my left wrist,” he told the magazine “TIME”, standing on the wing of his brightly decorated wooden house.
Kaiame still doesn't know who shot, but she says the bullet came from the Sherings of the assembled soldiers.
“There was a crowd, there were many shots,” he adds.
A local resident named Alphius Joab was shot three times, as his cousin described him as witnessing a shooting.
“I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” he said in a gloomy way to the journal “TIME” Johannes, which, like many Indonesians, only uses one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
General Yotje Mende, the chief inspector of the Papua Police, told reporters that his officers were merely “protecting” their base because it was being attacked.
“We must protect ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said Commissioner Pujo Sulistio of Papua Police in 2015.
“This is a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and more were injured.
The news of the murders only came to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi pronounced in Jayapur a speech in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historical abuses of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be settled immediately so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security of Viranto said he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical violations of human rights.
But we almost got excuses.
“The majority of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s or at the beginning of the zeros.
The point is that we certainly want to address these violations, but there are procedures to be followed," he said.
Then Viranto gave up his words, speaking with the journal TIME in Jakarta on 5 June, and said he had no plans to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All things will be decided by judgment."
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “criminals against humanity” for the death of more than 1,000 people during a bloody vote for East Timor's independence in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the incident in Panama.
The families of the victims from Panama have come across similar statements with gloomy mistrust.
“In the last three years, I have been questioned four times, but there has been no change at all,” says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Jacobus also expressed the view that the inhabitants of Panama were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came after me,” he said.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at village dwellers in the neighboring region of Deiyai, near Paniai.
During the clash between the villagers and the construction company manager, who refused to help bring a man unconscious to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four - year - old Ravianus Dove, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the road to a hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the office of the company’s construction site.
According to police officers, the villagers were throwing stones at officers who responded by firing a warning shot.
But locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesia specialnaz) started shooting at a crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we were afraid of retaliation,” said TIME, a 20-year-old Dominggu Badia, who lived near the hospital and saw the wounded delivered quickly.
"I hid in my house for two days."
The delegation demanded that officers involved in the incident be called upon to respond and that the mobile police brigade withdraw from the region.
Panama has always been a sick place for the Indonesian Government.
The dissatisfaction of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered all over Papua ' s green-covered central high-rise areas was a lack of significant development.
Many have joined the Movement for the Free Papua (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of Papuas by holding sporadic attacks and attacks against Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Panama, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Cogoya.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and detained on the pretext of “protection of national independence” by the military in Panama.
Some never came back.
Among the population of Papua Paniai is considered a “welcome, forgotten place”.
Poverty exacerbates resentment.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is equally inaccessible.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly notes, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually retain most of the crop for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten tubing notes stand only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
The economic disparities between indigenous papayas and new migrants have increased over time, which have come in large quantities since the introduction of new flights at Nabire Airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually given to more educated and viable migrants.
Papuan people rarely have the money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people do not want to stay in the village... because there is neither work nor money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Panayi tribal council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escuudi and Basil Lonchan were deported from Papua for “inadequate consistency with the relevant organizations” despite having rarely been allowed to conduct a video.
According to Felima Keene, Deputy Director for Asia of Human Rights Watch, promises made during Jokovi's election campaign to lift media restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
“Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua face new dangers: visa waivers and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
Lack of attention by the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “various and widespread violations” in Papua, including shooting at Panama.
The same countries in the past supported the OPM.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arramanat Nasir, withdrew from the group's statement to journalists in Jakarta, saying that “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there is a free press, so hiding evidence of human rights violations would be difficult”.
Locals want more foreign Governments to draw attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights Kisom Van Baar, visited Jayapur on 4 May, the locals violated their silence, asking, “We want freedom”, as the source claimed, which also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
New presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019, but the popes say they are unlikely to vote for the Jokovs again.
“Jokov is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in shooting at Panai,” says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokov to know that the inhabitants of Paniai, besides living in the shadow of the threat of a greedy army, are in poverty, and their education and health are in poor condition.
Gobai says that the inhabitants of Panama, like other papayas, view their voice as a debt owed to Jokov by him.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of shooting victims in Panama carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land right across from the police and the military.
Knowing that justice is probably never going to work, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
"Killed a member of our family," says Jacobus, without raising his head.
“What else were we to do?”
The second time the fire covers the Dubai skyscraper, “Fakel”
The fire covered one of the world’s tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to leave the seventieth - story structure at a height of 337 meters.
It is already the second high-rise fire known as the “Fakel” in two years.
The building had been evacuated, no human casualties were reported, and there was no operational news of the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get off the fiftieth floor," a skyscraper named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai City Civil Defence Department, fire teams extinguished the fire at about 4:00 local time (00:00 Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working on the provision of asylum to victims.
The incident could bring back to the agenda the safety of materials used in exterior high-rise buildings around the world.
During the investigation by the Fakela Administration, following the fire there in 2015, it was found that the poster was the most affected, the outer panels used for dressing and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police stated that they believed that the isolation system and the ceiling panels of the Grennell Tower building in London could have accelerated the spread of the fire that occurred there in June, resulting in the death of about 80 people.
Tourism flows to Ida Virumaa in June were minimal
According to data received by the correspondent of the Portal rus.err.ee in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists benefited from the services of hotels in North-East, which was 125 or 0.6 per cent higher than during the same period the year before.
The number of local tourists has declined and the number of foreign tourists has grown.
For example, foreign traffic increased by 7.3% (544) in June to 7994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The number of Russian tourists increased most noticeably in the region by 8.9 per cent or 318 compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, a total of 3885 guests from the RF stayed at Ida Virumaa hotels.
Andrey Malakhov made clear to worshipers who were responsible for his care
Andrey Malakhov hinted at his Instagram worshipers who were responsible for his leaving the First Channel.
So far, he has not commented on the rumor, but today he posted a piece of the newspaper's article "The News" on 1 August.
Malakhov signed the "boss milk" tag.
An article on how to prevent “burning” of an employee and to pay attention to his condition.
Looking back on the numerous reports that the lead failed to find a common language with a new producer who had begun to transform "Let Go," it becomes clear what he hinted so transparently at, says "KP".
TV broadcaster Andrey Malakhov was reportedly on leave and did not sign an application for dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation can be clarified in the coming days.
Five military soldiers were killed in Afghanistan when the car exploded
At least five soldiers were killed in an Afghan Guilmend explosion, according to RIA Novosti.
According to police, a mined vehicle exploded near the military blockpost in the town of Girishk the night before.
There are 20 deaths reported.
On Friday morning, a new CP took place in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked the exchange point.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diever took a video of a shark's camera.
The diver and researcher Greg Skomal (Greg Skomal) recorded on a video shark that had bitten his GoPro Ex-Camera.
A US Fisheries Agency unit in Massachusetts, composed of Skomal, has been listed on Facebook by Rolek.
The incident took place on 2 August off the coast of Cape Code in the north-east of the United States, the Necn portal clarified.
The man tried to remove the shark from the camera he was holding on a special stick during the underwater swim.
Noting the man, an animal of more than three metres length had reached him.
Shark tried to bite the camera without trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator had done so to determine whether he was fit to dress.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the instrument.
He also noted that such behavior of a marine animal was new to scientists.
There has been a known cause of mass fighting at the Ural military center
A working group of senior Central Military officers arrived at the Elan Training Centre, where a mass fighting took place, to investigate the incident.
Some details of the beating have already been made known.
According to data from the Mash Library, which appeared on the Vkontatte page, contractors from the Ural Military Part 31612 were fiercely fighting over an uninhabited bed.
It begins with the fact that a Private named Sayan has demonstrated that he has ignored the order of an officer to fill a furthest space.
Soldiers from the Sixth Company stood on the side of the officer.
Xiana supported the first mouth.
Within half an hour, 140 young men were destroyed in barracks with beds and sinks, and glass was knocked out.
More than ten people were injured in the mass battle.
In the CWI, information about the pantyhose was refuted.
The study showed that at least one fifth of passengers in the United States carried prohibited items on board.
The study found that more than 20 per cent of air passengers were deliberately or accidentally carried in baggage on board by air through the inspection posts of the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration, prohibited items, including at least 6 per cent of them, had been boarded with prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally had firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by the charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and covering more than 1,000 people also showed that young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately tried to fly with something prohibited by the ATB, 19.7 per cent were millionaires compared to less than 15 per cent of the members of the X-generation.
Consciously, ABB staff are most likely to carry food and water.
More than 3 per cent have been recognized as being particularly sensitive and 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents have admitted that prohibited drugs have been deliberately carried on board the aircraft.
The company stated that it had studied passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them were accidentally smuggled through inspections at airports and how much they had deliberately done so.
It is expected that most often, knowingly or unconsciously, they smuggle the smugglers through the inspection of those who fly the most.
According to the company, the ATV rules are quite complex and complicated.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry and how much they can carry.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what ATP selects are banned liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATP might be considered forbidden to carry books.
Liquids are allowed on domestic voyages, but not on international flights.
Chapter EPA Pruitt refuses to delay the implementation of Obama ' s emission reduction rules
On the day following the 15-state investigation, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency cancelled his decision to postpone the implementation of Obama ' s regulations to reduce emissions of air pollutants and to produce smog.
Pruitt explained his decision that his agency now more than in previous administrations was listening to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He did not mention the action against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute took place around 1 October, to which the states are required to comply with the 2015 land-level ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone their compliance for one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid “conformity with local solutions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Pruitt, who, before being appointed President Trump to his current post, was the Attorney General of Oklahoma State, was long known as a consistent opponent in the strengthening of environmental norms.
Following his transfer to Washington Pruitt, he had repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of standards that were opposed to the chemical or petroleum industries.
The sudden change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat by Piuitt to return to his former norms.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the chapter of the EPA had exceeded its authority to delay the Obama administration ' s compliance with a rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that he simply had the duty of the EPA to cooperate with States in the integrated timely implementation of new standards.
“In previous administrations, EPA was often unable to settle within the time frame, after which it awaited claims from groups of activists and others and discussed the timing of the settlement of the case”, said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen claims against the EPA in his previous post.
“We do not believe in the regulation of trials, and we take the deadline seriously.
We also take seriously our statute and the authority it gives us.”
Nevertheless, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at some point use his “retirement powers and other legal powers” to ensure that the rules “jcyjdfys in a clear course and in all available information”.
The Republicans in Congress insist on a wider revision of the ozone rules.
The bill approved by the House of Representatives last month seeks to postpone implementation of 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this matter.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that filed a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said that the group intended to continue with legal pressure.
"The changes in the EPA course, following our demands, are an important victory in the fight for health and security of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by their cities," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington joined the suit.
The ozone at the ground level occurs when conventional pollutants from cars, power plants, refineries and chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
This can cause serious breathing problems in those who are sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health and environmental defenders welcomed the sudden change in the Pruitt course.
“It’s sad to think how much pressure it took to achieve this perfectly logical step from the person who is charged with protecting the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Bird of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests.”
IAAF Congress prolonged the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics
The International Association of Light Athletics (IAAF) Congress voted in favour of the extension of the Space Federation of Light Athletics (WFLA).
Thus, the Congress supported the IAAF Board for the Restoration of WFLA, which issued a report on Monday, recommending that the suspension be suspended.
The extension of the suspension was voted upon by 166 persons, against 21 persons, and is passed on to TASS.
The report of the IAAF Board stated that WFLA had made significant progress towards meeting the conditions established by the Membership Recovery Board, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of WFLA at the World Cup in London, Russian foot-and-mouthers were forced to act under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to IAAF.
WFLA was disqualified indefinitely by IAAF in 2015.
The report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was then published, which referred to numerous violations of the WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.
For more details on the latest report of the IAAF Board, see the “U” material “IAAF has extended sanctions against VFLA”.
Sufficient defeat
As part of the 3rd round of the Russian Fonebeth Championship of PFL teams, Novomoskovsky "Chemik" held a retreat match against the FC "Kuluga".
Just over 10 days ago, rivals played in a cup of Russia, but this time the game was completely different.
The chemist did not give in to the opponent, but the second relaxation at the outcome of the match led to an insulted goal and fiasco.
After the recent defeat of the monks with the bill 0:3 many earlier prophesied the easy victory of the masters.
Since the beginning of the meeting, however, the Mosquitos have made themselves considered and acted against the defence, but from a position of power.
In the 1st time, the monks built more and enjoyed the advantage of the sword.
Alexey Orotin held another very high-quality match, which repeatedly reflected dangerous blows and gave his partners confidence in his actions.
Unfortunately, in the chemical attack, there was no effort or drive to put the Kalugi defense in a dead end and score the first goal on the way out.
After the break, the game began to run on course.
The New Yorkers were more active in the attack.
Anxious bells for our team were the defence errors that allowed the nuns to create a number of acute moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the chemical meeting, he took over the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the nuns played a role -- they had a better literacy and a more cool finish, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After the dangerous chemical attack, he transferred the ball to the corner, where the masters would pass the fields without resistance to the gate.
Urius Dubrovin was the author of the goal.
In the reporting meeting, Chemical demonstrated a good game, but he suffered an offensive defeat.
In front of our team, another exit is expected - on 11 August, at 19:00 in Moscow, at the Torpedo Stadium, Edward Streltsov's New Moscows will face the favourite of the Centr group, Ararat, composed of Roman Pavluchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexey Rebko.
Come back here and support "Chemik!"
The meeting place and time of the New Moscows is 6.30 p.m. near the Magnolia store (Eastern, etc.), which is located in the vicinity of the Magnolia store.
Composition "Chemika": Orontin, Manohin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Homutov, Goghija (Oreshkin), Dudayi, Ryzhov, Svetov, Belian (Adoevts), Andreichenko (Legin)

According to published telephone transcripts, Trump was pressuring Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post has published telephone decryptions between President Donald Trump of the United States and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Penay Nyeta Trump, he insisted that he stop publicly claiming that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The President of the United States scolded him for publicly speaking against the wall, and he said, "You can't tell the press."
Trump started his election campaign promising to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
His first telephone call to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also found in a published decryption.
Trump told Turnbull that an agreement under which the United States should accept refugees sent to Australia was “funny”, “disgusting” and “dumb”, and insisted that because of an agreement concluded by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot because he intended to end the relocation of refugees to the United States.
Trump concluded the conversation, telling Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation all day.”
The bodies of the tourists killed in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to Petersburg
A plane belonging to Russia’s airline, which has the bodies of Russian women killed in Abkhazia, flew from Sochi to St. Petersburg at 8:15 a.m. in Moscow.
At the end of the track, members of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the City Hall, would meet at the end of the boat, and told journalists the Deputy Minister for Tourists and Tourism, Abkhazia Astamyr Ahba.
Previously, representatives of the Ministry of the Interior stated that all expenses associated with the return of the bodies to Russia had been incurred by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to compensate the families of the victims of the death of 500,000 rubles.
According to Ahba, the Abkhasia leadership has expressed its willingness to pay for the victims of the explosions of tourists to fly over and reside in the Republic, but relatives have only sent the Republic to exercise the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On 2 August, at approximately 16:20 Moscow time, two explosions occurred in the village of Primorsky Gudautsk, in the warehouse of the Ministry of Defence missile and artillery weapons, followed by the detonation of large-scale shells and other ammunition.
As a result, the warehouse room was incinerated, causing uncontrolled explosions of various modifications.
As a result of the death of two Russian citizens, Elena Poljakova, and Elena Timofeeva, born in 1970, were two Russian citizens who were on vacation near the source of hydrogen hydrogen.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were brought to the Republic ' s health facilities with various degrees of severity.
At present, seven persons remain in the station and the rest are listed.
Study of Russian influence on American elections will be held by a large jury
Russia’s Special Prosecutor, Robert Mueller, convened a large jury in Washington, D.C., to investigate Russia’s influence on the U.S. president’s 2016 elections, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The collected material will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether it is sufficient to bring charges.
The grand jury gives Mueller additional authority to collect testimony.
One of those investigations of the jury panel, which started a few weeks ago, will be the details of the son's meeting then of a candidate for President Donald Trump with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnicka.
To check the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, Muller himself had previously promised.
They've already been studied by the FBI.
In late July it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. expanded the state of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. said earlier that he had been waiting for a compromise with the headquarters of a candidate from the Hillary Clinton State Department, but no revealing documents had been presented, and the adoption was ultimately the subject of adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump's younger statement to meet with Veselnicka was literally dictated by Trump senior.
In the White House, it was clarified that the president had not dictated anything, but simply used his authority to do anything for any father.
Deputy Mayor Pensa was detained in the workplace.
The Deputy Head of the Pension Administration, Irina Shiršin, was detained for 48 hours on instructions from the Investigative Committee at his workplace, reports RIA Novosti.
Official reports from law enforcement authorities on this matter have not yet been received, but the SC press office assured them that they would soon follow.
The Ministry of Pensions has not yet commented on what has happened.
Irina Shiršin is one of the five deputy heads of the Pension Administration.
She has been in charge of urban affairs and land relations since April 2015.
Prior to that, she had worked as Head of the Public Administration of the Penzensky Inspectorate.
Irina Shirshin reared three young children, notably that she again became a mother a year ago, gave up her maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no launch or launch site in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the fitting of Yuri Gagarin's bust is a tribute to the first man who's been to space.
Unlike the Soviet-era monuments, which are worn down in some countries, Gagarin's monuments, on the other hand, are “walking around the planet”.
In 2012, a monument was established in the United States of America at the former headquarters of NASA.
In London a monument on the Royal Observatory was installed in honour of the 50th anniversary of the first flight to space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfoot, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
A monument in Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic, avoided demolition in 1992 through public protests and was transferred from the city centre to the area outside the local airport.
During the 1970s, Gagarin in Riga came up with a monument to Yurius Gagarins.
That's what the first cosmonaut's name and surname is called in Latvian, and it looks like he's 70 years old.
Morse Ford's murder: activists lose Lynch's courts on stage to call for justice
In 1948, Ford Mercury drove past the spectators in Monroe, Georgia, and roared to the little Morse Ford Bridge.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver drove to the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its way.
The chief, a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin strip, stretched his cigarette and looked through the windshield.
The insides were filled with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" said the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
The persecutors broke the silence when the young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which took place on July 22nd, is just an invention.
But when Roger's neck was hit by a loop, almost all the viewers, and they really didn't breathe.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to lose again the night when, in 1946, they lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted of these murders.
“It’s amazing that no person has been arrested in all these years, although we see them near us; although we know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Georgia Congress, who has been fighting for human rights all his life.
To him, the spectacle is a dramatic appeal to action and an annual reminder to the inhabitants of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want to investigate, we want to complete, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must achieve justice," he said.
“We cannot go to healing and reconciliation until we have justice.”
The coroner is covering a simpler body of one of Morse Ford's lynching victims on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI reports received by En-Bi-Si News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights defenders say that the city has always had excellent knowledge of two linked lynching motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ruling first allowed black citizens to vote for the primerism that was to take place that summer.
During the same elections, according to the FBI, black shooter Roger Malcolm stabbed Burnett Hester, a white landowner, apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that, according to the rumors in the city, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she was supposed to have had was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 a bet to free Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove out of prison and drove to Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of lynchings surrounded the car.
“It is clear that Harrison has organized and commanded the killings”, one of the FBI reports concludes.
"It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between state and city law enforcement agencies, which not only participated in the killings but also destroyed evidence and hid witnesses' identities."
Brooks calls it short.
“It was an attempt at electoral rights,” he said.
"They were killed to send a signal to the black people in the city, if you register and vote, it will be the same with you."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Greene has been leading an annual spectacle reproducing that lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Its spectacle is seen, it captures the viewer and tells of the deep racism that many would like to believe is no more in America.
It's hard to look at and even harder to turn away, but Greene thinks that's what matters.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own freaks," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear what I've been through."
This year's performance began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors — a dozen whites, the rest of blacks — gathered in the room and listened to the year-long review of the play.
Wade Marbo was the director with Greene.
For several years, he played the chief member of the clan, but he said that the role did not become easier.
"I think I peed because it's not the person that I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at the time."
At the premises of Actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Burnett Hester, they repeat their roles.
The spectre begins when Malcolm, angry at having sex with his wife, Dorothy, screams and pushes him.
"I said, Nigga, get out of my house!"
Screaming Raskon in reply.
It's a hit.
And at the same moment, all (at least all black actors) are expressed in hochod.
Greene laughs harder than anyone.
"What's that?" Ask Ascon.
He's worried and embarrassed.
Am I playing?
'No,' said the Greene through laughter.
"I just don't think white people said 'nigga' at the time."
Yes, one of the black performers laughs.
"You've got to get through a hard 'r'."
And so does energy in the room: discomfort changes in the sense of companionship.
Everyone should do everything right, not only for the play, but also for the memory of four people killed.
The stage begins first.
This time, when Rascona speaks of the letter "n", it gets clear and sharp.
No man laughs.
Spectacles end violently and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes is standing over the actors' bodies and performing Billy Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
In a hundred yards, half a hundred spectators wipe their eyes with tears and sweat.
Almost equal numbers of blacks and whites among the viewers.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the show; many live very close together.
They endured for almost eight hours the heavy spirit of Georgia while Brooks led them to pilgrimage to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves.
Until that moment of murder, it was only history, but now that they're standing in the same place where people lynched, their ghosts seem to be coming out of the air right now.
When the last note of the song shuts up, Green invites people to come closer and look at the bodies.
The children bend over to their heads, touch the paint that depicts blood, and the motionless bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," is a mortician little boy, as if to remind himself of that.
In a few minutes, Greene thanks the audience, and it's all over.
Actors throw ropes off their necks and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugged Marbo, the man in the suit who played the main puppet.
Nick Rascone embraces two other actors and suddenly, crying, falling into their arms: the emotional strain of the performance finally hit him.
"It's all right," whispered one of the women.
"We know you have a good heart.
You had your reasons."
Later, the viewers sit down to have dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta are busy discussing a play with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinsky struggles to find words to describe how she feels after the performance.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, horrible words, and actions... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the lynching is still happening," she adds, "it's only now that it's called shooting the police."
In another corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks took note of his work as a human rights defender.
He said he had already begun planning the presentation next year.
"The decree excites us because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn it, it might happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
The court fined Naval for violations on the “agitation Saturday”
Moscow's Simonov court fined Alexei Navalé for 300,000 roubles for violating the rally's order.
The opposition party was found guilty of the administrative offence provided for in article 20.2 of the RF, “Re-infringement of the order of the rally”.
Earlier, the judge of the Simonov Court of Moscow, Hizir Mussakev, had completed his administrative review of Leonid Volkov, head of opposition chief Alexei Navalny, who had been held accountable under the same article as Navalna.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 rubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakaev evaluated the distribution of leaflets on the “agitation Saturday”, which Nabal supporters conducted in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
Having seen the agitatives followed by the Saturday participants, the police felt that the organizers of the event had deliberately hidden its true nature, a public action (for which it was necessary to seek prior authorization from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers, Ivan Jedanov and Alexander Pomazouev, applied for an end to administrative proceedings in the absence of an offence and indicated that the police had made some errors in the drafting of the protocol.
Volkov was not detained on the “agitation Saturday” itself, but he received an agenda that required him to appear in the police department to talk about the event he had carried out with active participation.
The same agendas were given to Nabalan himself and another opposing partner, Nikolai Laskin.
A shooting bride and three wedding guests were arrested in Mordovia
The court in Mordovia arrested a local man who shot four people at the wedding, including a bride.
This was reported to the Republican Bureau of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of 29 July.
During the fight, 42-year-old Saranska residents fired several rounds at guests of the activities that came to the rural prad to bathe.
Three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated with regard to article 213, paragraph “a” of article 213, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (“Holiganism”), article 30, paragraph 3, and article 105, paragraph (a), of article 105, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code (“An attempt to kill two or more persons who have been subjected by a general means of danger, from hooliganic motives”).
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man had opened fire because the wedding guests had decided to bathe in his waterfront plot.
Mineneergo will tighten requirements for turbine suppliers for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the RF will update the rules for providing information to suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power plants.
When launching gas turbines, GES turbines, oil and oil installations, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share access data from Minenergo and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The draft Government decision is already ready and put forward for public discussion.
The new requirements will affect only the “critical energy equipment” delivered to Russia.
The document identified potential threats such as information and access to the management of the site by foreign special forces, criminal elements and structures, infamy partners and hackers.
The European Union has extended anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
The press service of the European Union stated on 4 August that anti-Russian sanctions had been extended due to a scandal over the supply of Cimens turbines to the Crimea.
This was previously reported by the Week's Argues.
The EU Council's press service stated that sanctions against the RF had been extended due to the “Simens” turbine scandal, which had reportedly been brought to Crimea in order to circumvent the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals by member countries to extend anti-Russian sanctions.
It was previously reported that a final decision would be taken before the end of the day, and this decision was taken, the sanctions against Russia had been extended.
Pierson reduces another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, the British Education Group, Pierson, announced that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 per cent due to the start of a regular restructuring programme aimed at tackling the problems faced by their businesses.
These job cuts, which, according to the head of John Fallon, will take place mainly at the end of 2018 and early 2019, are added to the 4,000 jobs that have been reduced in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it plans to cut another £300 million ($394 million) in May in a third cost reduction programme to try to bring back to life a business that was hit by a rapid shift into digital learning methods.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its share of the Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said that its projections for the year remained unchanged after it announced an increase of 1 per cent in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers killed as a result of death
According to official sources, the suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital city of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, according to a NATO communication.
According to unverified data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of an incident in the Karabakh city area.
This explosion is the last of the massacres that struck Afghanistan this month: more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday as a result of an explosion at mosques in Gerat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Embassy of Iraq in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion that took place on Thursday night occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by a “portable person carrying an improvised explosive device”.
All the wounded are reported to be in stable condition and receiving treatment at the American Military Hospital at the Bagram Airport.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IG) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces located nearby in Bagram.
The United Nations reported that in the first half of 2017, at least 1,662 civilian casualties occurred in Afghanistan, and about 20 per cent in the capital.
At the end of July, the suicide bombing on the vehicle caused at least 30 deaths in the Shia area of Kabul.
Taliban stated that they had attacked.
On 31 May, a powerful explosion in the city centre killed more than 150 people, the most serious being the number of human victims of the terrorist attack in the country since the United States troops removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence has highlighted the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump assesses whether the number of United States military forces providing assistance to troops and police in the country needs to be increased.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul over the past weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its lines of conduct, and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency, following court proceedings, cancels the suspension of the adoption of the Air Pollution Act
The United States Environmental Protection Agency has rescinded the decision to postpone the adoption of Obama ' s Law that states should limit air emissions a day after 15 states have been brought to trial for that step.
On Wednesday evening, the Environment Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “Ozone 2015 measurements”, stressing that this step shows the Agency's willingness to cooperate with the States.
“We believe in and respond to dialogue with our state partners,” said the head of the Environment Agency, Scott Pruitt, in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone ozone measurements, where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where to reduce it in order to meet stricter air purity standards for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, most democratically, filed a lawsuit with the federal district of Colombia claiming to be illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to reverse the wide range of environmental regulations introduced by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader programme aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
But action in this direction has led to resistance from Democrats and environmental law enforcement organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on the health of the population.
The Agency for the Environment website states that using ozone-containing air to breathe “may worsen the function of light and increase respiratory symptoms”, for example, asthma.
European Business Association Against New Anti-Russian Sanctions
The European Business Association disagreed with the US economic sanctions against the RF.
In the view of AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and employment.
The AEB statement states that business is an important link between countries and people, and therefore free trade cannot be restricted.
The European business comprises more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of State and Government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would allow business to be separated from politics and to find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
MPs ask the police to limit traffic on the coast in Pskov
The Pskov People's Chosen Ones addressed the Chief of Internal Affairs of the city of Sergei Suriname on the issue of the Great Coastal River movement.
Members of the Gormud Constantine Bolotin, Gregory of the Parties and Valery of Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, the control of drivers would help to make the territory more calm and secure.
The problem is that the violators ignore the signs of the “Roadway” and are free to ride on the beach.
Capital repairs and repairs have been carried out for a period of no time.
Sports and children's playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable because of cars.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, the Pskov Information Agency is patrolled by PPS motorists and wives at night by the central coastal patrol.
As a result, the number of motor vehicles is becoming smaller, but the total traffic is not stopped.
Putin demanded that the investigative authorities not take out hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested that investigating authorities should be prohibited from extracting servers and hard drives from work computers in enterprises.
This is what the Head of State stated at the meeting on investment programmes for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, “the use of measures leading to the suspension of enterprises, including the removal of hard disks from work computers and servers, should be excluded”.
Putin noted that if investigators had such a need, “it is sufficient to remove copies, assure them and use them during the investigation”.
The Head of State added that it was not possible to “substantiate the conditions that prevented the business from continuing until the tax could not be paid”.
Olga Buzov told her how much she wanted to call her ex-husband.
TV company Olga Busov admitted that she wanted to call her ex - husband, Dmitri Tarasov.
So far, celebrity is in the United States, where it deals with work issues.
In fact, Olga was in Las Vegas just before, and then she decided to publish a post on Instagram.
She reported that she had not married, had not made any new tattoos, nor had she named her ex-husband saying that he had ruined her life, although she was keen to do so.
Busova reported that she would remember the trip forever because she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy died
British actor Robert Hardy, who played magic minister Cornelius Faj in the screenplay of a series of novels about Harry Potter, died at the age of 92.
The Independent reported on Thursday.
His relatives told him about the death of the actor.
According to them, he lived a great life by making a success in cinema, theatre and television in 70 years of careers.
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltnam.
In 1959, he played the Royal Shakespeare Theatre with Lawrence Olive at the Coriolan Tragedia.
Hardy also remembered the role played by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of the screenings of Agatha Christie's works on Miss Marple.
As a result of Churchill’s role in the BBC drama "Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years" (1981), he was awarded the British Academy of Cinematographic and Television Arts (BAFTA).
Robert Hardy also had to act as president of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Something went wrong in the Danish State: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean André, Count de Labord, refused to be buried together with his lovely wife, Queen Margrette.
This year's party is a golden wedding, but on the agenda, couples are not preparing for celebrations, but a rich argument.
His highness had renounced the title of Prince Consort, and he had impaled the Queen that she had never regretted the title of King Consort.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains officially the queen's wife.
Russia's MID called on Washington to stop scaring Moscow
In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Mike Pens, who accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Balkans, responded.
The relevant statement was circulated by the foreign policy department some time ago.
In its comment, the IIA pointed out that the United States is increasingly using cold war images that are inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the American authorities to cease to intimidate the RF.
As the weekly “Arguments” were written earlier, US Vice-President Mike Pens accused Moscow of attempting to destabilise the Western Balkans and of organizing a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mothers Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive individual.
Vassili Lomachenko and Mike García, who appear to be moving steadily to hold the most exciting boxing match of up to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the ESPN office space in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council champion, went down the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, World Boxing Organization champion in the second half weight.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over the former World Cup in four weight categories, Eiren Broner, on Saturday, on Showtime, both boxers enter five of the best boxers, regardless of the weight categories.
Garcia reached out to his right hand and said, "What's up, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko protects his belt in private with Miguel Marriago on Saturday at seven o'clock in the evening on the ESPN channel.
When the boxers posed for the photo, Lomachenko Manager Aguis Klimas noticed that the potential decisive battle between them would be the very first time.
“I used to be in a semi-alcoholic weight”, Garcia recalled.
"I'm up to 140 pounds for Bronner, but I'm not that big.
I'm drawing for 140.
I want to go down to the light side.
And he needs to go up to a half-mile [to 135 pounds], and then we're going to set up a unit.
That's what the sick people want.
Let us make it for them."
Lomachenko agreed.
“The box needs this unit”.
The climate asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service, as part of the strategy that it adheres to, for Lomachenko to carry out his debut match at 135 later this year, in order to appoint for the next summer a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who was also interested in fighting against the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the title of the world champion in light weight at the Forum Arena on 23 September.
“The fight may be on PPV because all the sufferers have asked for it,” Garcia said, expressing his willingness to fight later on on on the channel that would offer the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other names would be of such interest.
As soon as they are ready...”
Garcia said that Lomachenko considered Lomachenko to be a “shocking boxer” and might visit his Saturday unit.
But Lomachenko did not immediately flaunt Garcia's praises and said that he thought the champion in three weights from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry, Mikey... you asked for a knockout."
Garcia said he was focused on showing the power of impact and then boxing.
They both said that they felt the tension before their own individual.
“This fight must take place.
There's no other fight that's so much interest and conversation.
I am more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomichenko said, "I've been waiting for one of the cannon fighters, and there he is, Mikey.
This will be an excellent battle."
In several central streets, Moscow will cut traffic on weekends
On this weekend, 5 and 6 August, the movement will be restricted in the capital from Nastasia Street to Triumphal Square, along with the 1st Tverska-Jama Street.
In addition, the crossing will be closed on Leningrad Avenue, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tverska-Jama Street.
Both sections will be covered at all sites, the Moscow Department of Transport information centre reported.
The streets will be closed from midnight to 5 a.m. on 7 August due to their well-being.
The movement at the Moscow Coast will also be closed on weekends.
It's where the charge park is being built.
Putin instructed the D.A. to check out Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the Office of the Prosecutor-General of the Russian Federation to conduct a verification of the area of Baikal for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
“I request that the Public Prosecutor's Office check the Baikal Territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities”, Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on environmental development in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader requested action if the facts of the violations were identified.
New results of tests to assess the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden have been published
The latest results of tests by asylum-seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of age, show that more than 80 per cent of the protestors have been assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicalalverket) began conducting tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment of asylum more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) had been criticized for not being able to determine the actual age of some refugees claiming to be minors.
To date, the Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensic agency has now published 2,481 tests between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of the tested were assessed as 18 years or older, and in another 25 cases, the forensic agency estimated that the tested “probably 18 years or older”.
In the 432 cases, the conclusion stated that the person “probably less than 18”.
Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of a person is doubtful.
According to Johan Guernsson of the Forensics Agency, the results are consistent with those of the past month.
“We don’t see much difference with statistics over the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate,” he said to the “The Local” portal.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases “most likely the age of 18 years or older”.
However, after considering the 581 published results, Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases a person openly declared that he was 18 this year.
The method of medical assessment of age, designed to make the X-ray of the wisdom teeth and the tomography of the knee joints and to give them to dentists and X-rayologists, has also led to criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Karolin Institute of Claude Marcus, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of humans in order to determine whether they were sexually mature sooner or later.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think I need to use the measures that are being used right now.
The biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we cannot determine it with certainty, we should not pretend that we can,” he told the newspaper Metro.
However, Görnssen from the forensics agency supported the accuracy of the tests: “In general, the risk of mistaking a child as an adult can be said to be wrong.
The greatest risk we face is when a person is about 18, in which case he is about 10 per cent.”
I wonder if I'm running for president.
During his work trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said he was ready to consider whether he could vote for the post of President of Russia in the 2018 elections, the Interfax broadcasts.
This statement was a response to the request made by the inhabitants of the village of Cheremushka in the Boreta region.
During the video conference on the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and Irkutsk, the interviewer addressed Putin with the words: “Vladimir Vladimirović, we ask you, when the next election is to be held, we ask you all to run again for this post.”
"All right, I'll think about it, thank you," the president replied.
On 28 July, Russian President Dmitry Peskov, Press Secretary, commented on some media statements that Vladimir Putin's election headquarters would be headed by President Anton Vayno, Head of the President's Administration.
Peskov called these assumptions “nothing based on hypothetical reasoning”.
"Until there are no headquarters, until the headquarters is established far away, until the electoral campaign is far away," Sandkov said.
“Until this is on the agenda”, Sandov said.
The Governor of West Virginia said he was moving to another party
The Governor of West Virginia, the representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday during a rally with President Trump, moving to another party.
“You like it or not, but the Democrats have distanced themselves from me,” said Governor Justice.
“Today I speak to you with many prayers and many reflections...I tell you today, the people of West Virginia, that I can no longer be useful to you as a democratic governor.”
The rally burst with applause.
"So tomorrow I will change my registration to a Republican," Justins added.
“As a coach, I would tell you that it’s time to play differently.”
Trump had previously promised that an important statement would be made at the West Virginia rally.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 per cent overhang, and Justice did not support the Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, because he inherited a coal business from his father.
Its condition is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republic Party issued a statement on Thursday evening that “The transition of Governor Justice to another party is another blow against the Democratic Party, which is more impeding than working to make our country big again”.
“Being aware of only 15 governors and the control of the smallest number of state legislative bodies in history, the statement of Governor Justice is just another rejection of a party that has no leaders above the bottom and is unable to find a positive, unifying message”, said CBS News, a representative of the National Committee of the Republic Party, Ron McDeniel.
Kot-telelovos by the name of Mr. Krasavčík found a home thanks to social media
Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., piloted a cat named Mr. Krasavčík over 14 kilograms after becoming famous for the Internet.
Mashable reports it.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was published on Facebook in the pitman's account asking him to find his master, because "he was apparently fed by someone earlier."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the fur of an animal could become a new meme.
More than 3.2 thousand locusts and 15,000 comments received the publication.
In the commentary, dozens of people expressed a desire to shelter Mr. Beauty.
As a result, he was put into the hands of Angela Frazee, who promised to take on his excess weight.
In a WNCN radio interview, an American woman said that she had experienced this experience: she took a cat weighing about 10 kilograms [10 kg] at home, and now she weighs a little more than five.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
An animal photo post collected over 68,000 views.
The commentators noted that she could well make a career in a model business.
Cou praised Russia's “honestly” apologies for the doping scandal
The International Athletics Specialist Sebastian Coe praised on Thursday what he called Russia's sincere apologies for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was not a good time to allow the country to participate again in sports competitions.
The Russian representative of the Light Athletics Federation, Dmitri Puttin, reported to the Congress of the International Association of Light Athletics, which had passed the world championship in light athletics, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who had stolen gold and silver medals in the competitions”.
Despite his comments, Congress of the International Association of Light-Athletes Federations voted in favour of the removal imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the evidence of the use of doping financed by the State.
“I felt that today’s response, today’s report was very sincere,” the president of the Cou International Association of lightweight Federations told reporters.
“All the council and all the Congress enjoyed... that the Russian Federation itself recognizes that it has experienced extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the Federation.”
Cou said that he also enjoyed Russia's acceptance of the criteria for its reconstruction.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that now is not the time to restore Russia to rights,” said Koe.
“In the next few months, we must do everything we can to deal with this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate pure athletes from the entangled system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, in line with the strict criteria of the International Association of lightweight Federations, will participate under neutral flag in the light athletics world championship, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements had yet to be met for the reconstruction of Russia.
As he told reporters in London after a report to the Board of the International Association of Light-Athletes Federations, drug testing is still not being carried out in sufficient volume, and suspended trainers are still performing their work calmly.
Court arrested Ukrainian journalist suspected of incarceration
A journalist, Vasily Muravitsky, detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBS), has been sent to arrest for two months, is transferring the SBU.
Journalal Zítomir, a member of the Internet publication, is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and in violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a “barbar policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to undertake a limited military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
The Commander Borsini patrol ship entered Libya's territorial waters to then, along with the Navy, halt the influx of illegal migrants.
The start of the operation was decided by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which does not control much of its territory.
The opposition to the Cabinet and the Libyan Parliament based in Tobruk accused Italy of violating Libya ' s sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to oppose the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they stated that they did not believe these threats and intended to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
Last week, the situation was discussed in the negotiations between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the recognized Libyan Cabinet, Faiz Saraj, Europe.
The Italian authorities set up a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics were published in July on the number of illegals arriving from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
In the Government, it was stated that the resources for admission of migrants had been exhausted.

Two leaders of assembly Ukraine were suspended from attending CMM
Olga Zemljak and Olesia Powch, who are running for short distances, are excluded from the assembly of Ukraine for the World Cup 2017 in London.
This is reported on the Federation of Light Athletics (FLAU).
Such a decision was taken by the organization in connection with the launching of the International Association of Light-Athletes Federations (IAAF) disciplinary proceedings in respect of light-Athletes.
The Ukrainian delegation also excludes the trainer, Sergey Basenko, from the country.
According to Sportarena, IAAF suspects an athlete in the use of doping.
The Olympics 2012 and the World Cup 2011 bronze lake, Europe-2010 champion 4 to 100 metres, Zemljak winner of the 2012 European Championship 4 to 400 metres.
The peace championship in London will be held from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football will affect the move of Naymara to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not interfere with the world record of Naymar from Spain's Barcelona to France's Pari Saint-Jerman.
Whatever consequences may follow the chain, the UEFA, the governing body in charge of European football, in whose power it is to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious League of Champions tournament.
From the 2011 Financial Fair, introduced by the UEFA, it follows that the FGM will eventually have to show that the transfer of Naymara was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) only to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Najmar will receive a tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of the transfer of Neumar to France.
The FGM can surely be squandered to hire Neumar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, taking into account the funding of the team by the rich energy of the ruling Qatar family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums on the purchase of players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after his election as president of UEFA in 2007.
A former French football player believed that clubs with huge debts in their pursuit of success were essentially fraud and risk destruction in case banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on the debt of clubs and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change of business model originally used by Roman Abramović in Chelsea in 2003, buying a club with good potential and then seriously spending to improve the team and create a world brand became a difficult plan.
During the current three-year evaluation period, which took place in 2018, clubs can lose EUR 30 million.
And despite the disgraceful removal of Platini from the presidency in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to contain excessive spending.
“It is understood that FFP is alive, and we will move forward to tighten the rules,” said Associated Press last week, Andrea Traverso, who controls the FFP at UEFA.
Although PWW and will pay the purchase of Naymar's contract at the same time, it may, for the record, distribute this amount over the entire duration of his contract.
Najmar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual report as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were applied to FGM and to Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
A fine of €60 million (at that rate is $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million, was ordered to limit the composition of its team to the Champions League during the 2014-1015 season by 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to outsmart its financial inspections by blowing up their income for the company owners.
While a Qatari company could contribute to the FGM, if the amount of funding was considered to be above the standard market price, the UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the financing of the FGM by the Qatar Tourism Authority was dilated.
It was reported that part of Neumar's earnings in the FGM could have been paid by the organizational committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But FGM and Qatar-2022 deny that Najmar will be the ambassador of the world's championship, and such a maneuver could easily be discovered by UEFA inspectors.
The previous sanctions imposed on FGM mean that UEFA will be more closely monitoring any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday by persons familiar with the situation, UEFA did not hold preliminary discussions with FGM on the Naymar transfer.
They spoke to Associated Press in an anonymous manner, as they were not authorized to discuss the situation of “FGM”.
According to the latest published report, over 10 million euros in turnover of EUR 542.4 million were received in 2015-1016.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
The FGM expects the arrival of Naymar to be a favourable basis for sponsorship transactions, the sale of attribute and team-type T-shirts.
The club is expected to grow by at least 30 per cent as a result of the recruitment of a new player.
Unquestionably dismayed by one of the best football players, the Spanish League tried to disrupt Naymar's transfer by saying that the FGM would violate the financial play.
“This is an obvious case of “financial doping,” with the club and the State,” President La Liga Javier Tebas said to the Spanish newspaper “AS”, referring to Qatar as the final owner of “FGM”.
Arsenal coach Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to the American Sports Magnate, shares La League's doubts about the funding of the club by the State.
“This is all the consequences of participation, and this has completely changed the football landscape over the past 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, perhaps everything.
It's going to be very difficult to respect the financial play because there can be many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
Order and place of oath will be determined by the President
Where and as new Russian citizens will swear to the loyalty of the RF, the President will determine such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law have been drafted by the State Committee on Legislation and Statehood.
A week ago, the deputies planned to determine directly how the oath was to be sworn in the law.
Children under the age of 18 will be released from the solemn oath, as well as incapacitated, from the revised text of the amendments to the Law on Nationality of the Republic of Croatia (hereafter the “Report”), which the Committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on 11 July.
On 6 June, President Vladimir Putin supported the adoption of an oath on the entry into the citizenship of the Russian Federation instead of the formal signing of the documents, during a meeting with the Speaker of the State, Vjeceslav Volodyna.
The MPs formulated this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the draft law to repeal the decision on the extradition of nationality to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist offences: for example, for public calls for terrorism or for public justification in the media or on the Internet (No. 2 Art. 205.2 of the Criminal Code), as well as for hijacking an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act relates to terrorism (No. 4 Art. 211 of the Criminal Code).
According to the bill, the logic of the bill was that, in the form of citizenship documents, a person is signed under the promise to abide by Russian legislation - he has embarked on the path of extremism, and he is in violation of that promise.
The bill was introduced in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasilev ("One Russia"), Gennadi Zuganov (CRC), Vladimir Jirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov ("Justified Russia"), and by the Speaker of the DG Vjeceslav Volodin.
On 19 May, he was accepted on first reading.
Last week, the DG State and Law Committee approved the draft draft for second reading, but has now been redrafted.
It now states that the order of oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Parliamentarians had previously intended to describe the procedure directly in the Nationality Act of the Russian Federation, stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting before the State coat of arms and the Russian flag in the presence of the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event was to take place - a list of places where it could be located - was regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, heads of government, municipal entities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could be the ZAGS.
The solemn oaths wishing to obtain the citizenship of the FF will be made after the officials have verified their documents.
But the Russian passport will be obtained only after the oath has been made and the text has been finalized.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russian oaths will be made at the age of 18 and not at the age of 14.
A rule has been maintained that oaths will be made free of incapacitated or incapacitated, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or sign the oath by hand.
Furthermore, the President of the RF has the right to exempt from this procedure and “other persons”,
The updated bill also prescribes a special procedure for the admission of Russian citizens to the Russian language.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian nationality by making a declaration to the competent authority of Ukraine for that purpose.
A notarized copy of the application will have to be transmitted to Russian officials.
Denial of “foreign” nationality, as is the case now, will not be required if this is provided for by an international treaty or if this is not possible “for reasons independent of a person”.
The relevant amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, among whom was the first Vice Speaker of the DG Ivan Melnikov (CRCF), Natala Pokładskya, Paul Krašeninnikov and Irat Farrahov (all - "One Russia").
I think a lot of you know that getting a background check with Ukraine is just impossible.
Accordingly, very many people are awaiting a decision on the nationality of the FP, explained Paul Krašeninnikov (ER) head of the Duma Committee on Housing and Legislation earlier.
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on the employment of certain posts for foreigners would not apply to those who in writing renounced “other” nationality and gave their previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, but “for reasons beyond their control” it did not cease to be a national of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited from taking up posts in the municipal service, to be admitted to work at facilities and in organizations whose activities relate to the security of Russia.
Nor can a person with dual nationality or residence permit of another country become a member of the State or a member of the Council of the Federation.
It is planned that the law should enter into force on 1 September 2017, by which time the necessary regulations should be prepared.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in "Horse American Summer" and "Doctor's Tomb."
The current iteration of history nostalgically recalls both the glorious days of the characters in the 1980s; the era of the border in the 1990s (for example, when the outstanding artists David Wayne and Michael Showalter made a comedy of the sketch "State" for MTV); and about themselves, the year 2001 before her stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Pauler and Paul Radd, moved on to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the rise and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But she seems like an anachronistic Frenchman.
The "First Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, and not only because of the absurd humor (including the original story of the talking bank of vegetables that H. John Benjamin made).
The result is doubling the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have only just reached adulthood, making it impossible for them to return to being part of the joke.
“Ten years later”, where adults have been playing adults, has less emotional roots, and its parody is more inconclusive and includes riffs from stalker movies of the 1990s, such as “Hands climbing a cradle”.
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates, and a bunch of other things from 1991.
Many of the plots are the same.
Good - hearted Coop (Shoulter), now a writer, has not yet achieved reciprocity from Katie (Marguerite Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet parted with virginity.
And there's a crazy, mean conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also Shawlter), which is now being incited by George Bush Senior (tested parody in the performance of Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the deviation from it.
It's especially fun to see an eternal young Radd who sings Matt Dillon's song from "The One," whose character, the former great man Andy now looks old-fashioned.
This franchise could succeed in random crazyness in the spirit of the Seven Up recursive series, until it comes to what I think would be the logical conclusion of it: "Worthier American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where in the last scene the company would go to the movie premiere of the American Summer Warmer.
The "Detective Comrade" in the Amazon is referring to another type of nostalgia: memories of the cold war from the American, the Blow-up Blond, or even the Flash with its images of the East and West struggle.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Riz Thomas, depicts a film: the Romanian Police Drama of the 1980s on two police officers in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and Marxist-Leninal path.
The main role of the visionary life of Gregor and the idealist Josephus is played by Florine Piersick, Jr. and Cornelius Street, and by the dialogues by Channing Tatum (the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levit.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are several visual jokes (police officers spend time watching chess games like Americans could watch football).
The team of famous voices behind the shot, including Jenny Slatt, Nick Oferman, Mahershal Ali, and Chloe Sevini, makes it interesting to play "Guess the Voice".
But the Detective Boy's is so holding onto the most plausible propaganda drama-- there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask, which is often what it looks like.
Six long episodes are prolonged, and it's funny not very often.
If it were made shorter, the "Detective Comrade" could better handle his satire in the spirit of agitpro; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American Embassy, there are two fat people sitting in the lobby who absorb a bunch of hamburgers.
To the imaginary Communist viewer, this image says that Western culture is capable of anything to eat.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not wrong: We do so even with our recent history and with theirs.
Russia's Supercup Football Fight Fund between Spartacus and Lokomotiv will be about 30 million rubles.
This was reported by Russian Premier League (RFP) President Sergei Predkin at a press conference.
According to the chapter of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70 per cent of that amount, according to RT.
He also added that to date there were almost no tickets to the match.
Spartacus Match will be held on Friday, July 14th, at 9:30 p.m.
As TASS notes, Spartacus is an active RF champion and Lokomotiv is the owner of the country's Cuba.
Two young minds cleaned the furniture for 200,000 roubles
A 37-year-old man with a furniture firm came to the police the other day.
The man stated that he had stolen expensive tools from the site, which caused serious damage to his production.
Scissors have become instruments of a total value of nearly 200,000 roubles: two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulics, and a winch.
Guards of order began searching for criminals and soon came out to be friends of 23 and 24 years of age in Blagovesten district of Bascortostan.
According to the media service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the interlocutors infiltrated the premises of the enterprise, broke the front door and delivered the tools.
Right after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first hit-and-run car service.
A theft case has already been initiated against them, and only part of the stolen instruments have been returned to the legal owner.
Gosdep commented on Medvedev's comments on the relations between the RF and the United States
The United States and Russia must be able to work with each other.
That statement was made by the official representative of Mr. Heather Nawert in response to the words of the Prime Minister of the RF, Dmitri Medvedev, concerning the relations of the two States.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Government stated that the United States had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and had declared a full trade war by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions.
In commenting on those words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations were “low” but noted that “the areas for interaction” should be sought.
"Look at the truce in south-west Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," says the diplomat RIA Novosti.
However, a representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the Russian Prime Minister ' s statement that sanctions amount to trade war.
The new sanctions bill for Russia, Iran and the DPRK was signed by the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, on the last Wednesday.
He acknowledged, however, that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "grassed" roses from amethysts and quartz
Dior - Dior Joaillerie, French fashion house jeweler, filled the Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose collections.
They had five new rings and three cohorts on velvet ribbons.
Rose Dior Pré Catelan produces two new rings and a coulon of amethysts, pink quartz and diamonds, performed in the technique of gliptics (hand cut by stone) and a respect for the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Viktuar de Castellan was inspired by roses that grew in its Granville apartment modeling house Christian Dior and the Paris gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Catellan.
Trump found the culprits of the deterioration of relations with Russia
The President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, made a strong criticism of the members of the Congress.
In the view of the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relationship with Russia is extremely low and dangerous.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," the president wrote on Twitter.
Prior to that, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In particular, they will be affected by Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House circulated a presidential statement stating that the law would not allow the United States to enter into profitable transactions and would bring the RF, China and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian entrepreneur renounces purchase of Ukrainian daughter Sberbank
An entrepreneur from Belarus Victor Prokopenenia withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
A businessman explained to the RBK the intention to “focus on other of our planned investments and projects on which we are working”.
Mr. Prokopeni said that such a step would be “the best investment of time”, despite the investment attractiveness of the purchase of Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenenia became the main bidder for the purchase of a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the Norwegian Bank consortium, Grigorija Huselnikov and the Belarusian company Saida Guteriev in July.
The Russian banks left the Ukrainian market after the President of the country, Peter Poroshenko, imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One such financial organization, in addition to WTB and the Foreign Bank, became Sberbank.
Novak named the cause of a blekout in the Crimea
In the Ministry of Energy, the RF identified the cause of the Blackout in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Nowak, explained what had happened.
He said that the peninsula was powerless because of a road accident in the Krasnodar region.
The truck that was caught in the accident hit the power lines, resulting in the shutdown of the Cuban and related Crimean networks.
The power failures in large Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The specialists have removed the problems within hours.
Initially, it was reported that the cause of the Blackout could be anomalous heat.
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have caused rumours of a possible increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain intolerable and left interest rates unchanged among rising pressures on family incomes.
Bank monetary policy experts (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to maintain the rate of 0.25 per cent, while fewer members of the committee voted for an increase in the rate in that month, because weak economic growth has weakened support for growth.
In its quarterly report on inflation, the bank has limited its projections to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that the pressure on family incomes will continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to about 3 per cent in autumn.
However, the Bank warned that the increase in interest rates over the next few years would be necessary to control the brisk inflation, and stated that loan costs would probably have to be raised more strongly than expected in financial markets.
The members of the committee also voted in favour of abandoning part of the huge package of economic measures launched a year ago due to the brixite.
Since next February, the Bank will close the emergency financing plan by which it provides banks with cheap loans, although it has reported that it is now due to provide an additional £15 billion, up to £11 billion under the plan.
In the decision-making report on rates, the bank said: “In line with the main forecasts of MPC, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) in the near future remains slow, while the pressure on real family income continues to affect consumption.”
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that in order to halt inflation, “some tightening of financial policy” would be required in a “more” amount than market expected.
At present, markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of the following year and another increase in 2020.
But the Bank stressed that all promotions would be “progressive” and “limited”.
The Bank ' s projections for this increase and the following year are lower than the projections made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank maintained its forecast of 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After this news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and 0.4 per cent to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent dissatisfaction rates decreased the expected increase; GDP rose by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter against 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the representative, growth is expected to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The latest report by the Bank on inflation has given little cause for joy to households affected by high inflation and very slight wage increases: according to the bank, pressure will increase before it decreases.
The Bank added that the financial policy could not “prevent” a turnaround in the next few years, but expected that salaries would be “significant” to be recovered by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also geared towards growth as a result of the growing demand for British goods resulting from a low rate of pound, which offsets some of the reduced consumer costs.
The decision was taken one year after the rates were reduced to 0.25 per cent in the last August following the shocking outcome of the referendum on the withdrawal of the Pound from the European Union.
The Bank is expected to take four years to fully influence prices and economies.
Before the bank made its final decision at the rates, there was an increase in noise around the expected increase in rates, as inflation was increasingly pressured by strong household pressures: three members of the expert committee asked for a higher rate of 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that the decline was expected and that it was offset again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher rate than the planned 2 per cent is the result of the lower rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of the Corco Mortgage Brokers, said: “If we take into account the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become even more competitive again, as creditors demand business opportunities and look forward to a good end of the year.
The market is particularly favourable to those who are approaching the end of their existing treaties, as the refinancing of credits, often with the lack of a commission, as well as with a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.”
The Public Health Service will prescribe a disputed HIV drug of 10,000
Since September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” HIV prevention drug after the Battle of the High Court on the financing of drugs from the Public Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that pre-exposition HIV prevention (PREC), a pre-sex pill that has been proven to reduce the risk of infection in people at risk by an average of 86 per cent, would now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year probation period of some 10,000 persons.
She agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal supported the High Court's ruling last year, which stated that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay for the PreEP despite her allegations that it should be financed by local authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was called “the most important innovation” by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it “a turning point”.
Prior to the full launch of the programme throughout England by April 2018, the ventilation dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, and more dispensaries will join the programme in October.
Pre-position prevention (PREC) is a course of HIV medicines taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Research has shown that PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
At the time of adoption of Pre-Sex in the human body, a sufficient number of certain drugs are available to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or not later than two hours before sex.
Patients entitled to a drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose partners are HIV-positive and who are not receiving successful treatment.
The dispensaries will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and those whose partners are unknown whether their HIV status is inhibited by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a doctor of general practice in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest veterinary dispensary participating in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England signed a drug contract this week after the international procurement tender.
The study was designed to assess all the potential of the EPR for the collection of clinical data on the substance's target audience, its absorption and large-scale use.
“This crucial innovation must complement and strengthen large-scale and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone for more than three decades in the fight against one of the greatest health threats facing mankind.
Deborah Gold, President of NAT (National Office for AIDS Control), said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If it is literately targeted by people in need of help and at risk, it is possible to change the HIV epidemic situation in England.
Since September, people at risk of HIV will be given access to a new new facility, which a person can control without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Jan Greene, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “At present, it is important to ensure that the test is rapidly deployed throughout the country and that none of the HIV risk groups are forgotten.
Now that we have been provided with the experimental drug, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV.”
Shadow Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said, "We very much welcome the start of the Preep test, it has been greatly delayed by months of delays and delays on the part of the Government."
The data show how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this year-on-year infection.
This test will bring us closer to a step towards a full understanding of the advantages of PreeP.
It is now important that the test be deployed as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people at risk of HIV and move us further towards the end of the spread of HIV in society.
The World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution on support for the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Meeting of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the office of President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “a reputable form of organization of the highest public authority in the Republic and expressing the national interests of the whole Tatar people”.
In addition, the assembly stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the delimitation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he “has played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
Remember, since 24 July 2007, the treaty between Moscow and Kazanju has been concluded for 10 years.
On 11 July, members of the State Council of Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and retain the name of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only entity in the Federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one called “President”.
In Russia, difficulties have arisen in obtaining international driving rights
The HYBDD units are experiencing a shortage of international driving permits (IWIs).
In order to obtain such rights, it takes several weeks to wait, which has become a real problem for vacationers wishing to travel abroad on their own car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving permits remains controversial.
The IDP was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, as the information was explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are also recognized in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention.
In fact, however, everything depends on specific police or rental offices: some require IDPs and some have sufficient national rights.
In order to be insured, drivers of international law do receive, but it should be borne in mind that in non-ratification countries (e.g. the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or IDPs.
There is now a problem with the forms in almost all the units of the GIBDD, reports the Commersanta, by conducting a study in a number of regions.
For example, in Moscow, there are simply no handouts in the IGIBDD units, and the forms have been missing for four months.
You can sign up for admission on the service site, but it has grown there by mid-August.
In the Krasnoyarsk Ministry, it is impossible to obtain “for technical reasons” without detail, in the Samar region it is fair to say that there are no forms, a similar situation occurs in other cities.
Many Moscows have already encountered the problem, and social media reports are increasing:
Irina Burmistrov: "I wonder why you can't get international rights in Moscow?"
That's right, because all the GiBDD offices have completed the forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "The question to those who know."
International rights need to be gained very urgently.
In Moscow, it's always stuck far ahead, there's no handouts at all (the button is, but the gift can't give).
It's like the service portal shows that time is free to shit.
Did anyone try to get in another city?
Is it gonna work?
According to the IMF, the requirements for international driving licence forms have changed, and new forms are being supplied to the Gosavto inspection units.
This may be due to the deficit, but it is not clear what changes are being made before this has been reported.
Blanky purchases the Road Safety Special Purpose Centre (BDD CCN) of the IMF RF and then supplies them to the GYBDD units.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with Goznak AO: in 2014-2015, nearly 200,000 IWU forms were manufactured, in 2016 15,000 forms were purchased, in 2017 90,000, but the last contract was concluded on 18 July with the First Printing Court OO for the manufacture of 70,000 forms.
There is a version that CSN just failed to hold a tender on time, which led to a deficit.
In fact, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to travel, not to Europe alone, but to the cheaper Asian countries, China, Thailand and so on.
What rights they accept there are not clear to the end, so people are re-insured, and so there is a huge demand for international “footsteps”.
Recently, it became known that professional drivers would have to pass the examination to confirm their qualifications.
Mintrans made such a proposal.
The new model has been in operation since 31 May 2011.
Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Pavel Petrenko, stated that he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
On Friday, August 4th, he said in an interview with the "Watcher" portal.
No self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or lever there, because it risks losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan, in countries that have joined sanctions against Russia regarding the Crimea.
“I mean, in my opinion, there is actually no prospect of this project,” said Petrenko.
He added that Russia was unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build smaller objects.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, whole stadiums have begun to collapse.
“I therefore believe that the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have become so shortsighted to join this project”, the official noted.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of the Krim Bridge Road Ark.
A large assembly of the Crimea Bridge road arch has been completed on the Krkan coast: it is 45 metres from the base of the construction.
“At the same time, the bridge builders prepared a rail arch for the fairway supports”, the project information centre reported.
In April, the head of Mintrans Maksim Sokolov informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean peninsula and the Krasnodar region.
In Spain, an employee who had not been to work for 10 years was fired
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should have been possessed by Spanish official Carles Resio?
Permanent walking was ten years long.
After all, Mr. Resio was dismissed.
But not your direct boss.
Whatever happens in the world of bureaucrats.
The robbers seem to have gotten used to all the "people of the people" jokes.
Yet, officials are always surprised by the way they live on their taxes.
This time, the "sensation" was sorry from Spain.
There, a member of the Valencia archive, Charles Resio, managed for ten years not to go to work.
At the same time, he received a regular appeal.
But it's all solid, 50,000 euros a year.
Mr. Resio's "weird times" are over.
He was dismissed by decision of the Valencian Legislative Assembly.
In the investigation, it was found that an angry walker came to the office every morning at 7:00 a.m. to check in on the electronic system.
I was just going home.
Once again he showed up at the workplace at 16:00 to recapture in the system that he had left.
Ten years.
It also became known that all the leisure time the walker devoted himself to drawing comic books at home.
The members of the Valencia Legislative Assembly are now thinking of how to punish the immediate chief, Mr. Resio, who could not help but know how to “actively work” in his workplace.
Judges propose to protect from the Presidents
On behalf of Vladimir Putin, the Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC), has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HR Committee proposes to limit the powers of the chairpersons of the courts and to introduce their election.
For appeal and cassation courts, the HR Committee wishes to introduce special districts that will not be linked to the administrative and territorial division in the RF.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential mandate.
The HR Committee has finalized proposals to strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out on behalf of Vladimir Putin on 3 January 2017, which the President gave after meeting the members of the Council.
Meeting with Council members on 8 December 2016 discussed individual cases of arbitraryity, as well as issues of public control in places of detention (see “U” of 9 December).
The work of the HR Committee has resulted in 25 proposals dealing with both the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors and the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to restrict the powers of the Presidents of the courts to enhance the independence of the remaining judges.
If the candidate for the post of judge has been successful and has received the support of the judiciary, the President of the court, in the view of the HR Committee, should submit him for appointment without the right to refuse, as the law now permits.
It is also proposed that the President be deprived of the right to refer cases to judges.
Experts are allowed to do so, perhaps a specially written computer program.
The HR Committee also considers that the President is not entitled to “predict the results of the judge ' s qualification, initiate his disciplinary action, decide on the establishment of additional material payments”.
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to proceed to the “election of the Presidents of the courts by the judges themselves” and “to give them powers for a relatively short period of mandatory rotation”.
All the Presidents of the courts (from the Republic to the District) are now appointed for six years by the President to represent the President of the Supreme Court of the Republic.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the HR Committee proposes to re-organize appeals and cassation before courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial division of the FF.
It is said that “it is necessary to ensure that individual courts of appeal and cassation are organized, not at the level of the regional courts in the areas of the RF, but in the judicial districts”.
Experts take as the basis the practice of arbitration courts.
They have “court districts” that do not coincide with the administrative division in the FF, but which thus guarantee greater independence from regional officials who have difficulty using “phone law”.
The HR Committee proposes to strengthen the parliamentary population to consider, with their participation, some “categories of civil and administrative matters”.
For example, on the deprivation of parental rights, on the restoration of work, on the protection of honour and dignity, on the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
“These are only our proposals”, explained the member of the HRJ, Judge of the Constitutional Court in the resignation of Tamara Morschakov.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate was not only to the HR Committee but also to the Supreme Court (CJ), which had not yet revealed its proposals.
There is still time to carry out the mandate of the High Commissioner (with the co-rapporteurs - the Prosecutor ' s Office and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the RF).
To report to Vladimir Putin on the effectiveness of the independence of justice in the RF, the President of the Armed Forces, Vjeceslav Lebedev, is due until 1 September.
Living a high life: half-age and clever design arrangements have made this little apartment in Earls Court a spacious home.
Joan Lee, a former real - estate banker, moved from a spacious home in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is located on the first floor of a nice typical Anna-style house, and in favor of a new design, Joan did not collect her belongings and move again.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger square," Joan says.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered her a price on the same day."
Since the first view of the apartment, the space of 1,000 square feet has been completely reconstructed.
Initially, it was an apartment with one bedroom complex planning – to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add storage spaces and a half-storey to get the most out of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," she said.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill architectural design studio "Duck & Shed" to use ceilings of 12.5 feet high and to create a home that would not only be a successful project but would be suitable for Joan's life.
The ceiling was not high enough to fit the two premises above each other, so the architectural task was to create a semi-rooted area where full growth could be achieved.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the barber.
“Working with steel structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We had to place the premises so that they were above each other, and we did not have to bend.
It was necessary not just to build a simple platform, but to avoid constructions so that they could be at the right height and use the upper and lower spaces.”
This decision allowed Erfan to set up two full-sized rooms above each other in a certain space — and much more interesting.
From the half-storey through the winding honey light window from Retrouvius, a view of the beautiful living room below opens.
Mirror furniture with gold compartments, silver accents and winding lighting devices from Serge Muja set the design style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding visibility, space and light.
The short corridor is surrounded by mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror panel looks like a window to another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinets serve to store Joan’s entire container.
To create a feeling of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can block the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new about cooking.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's moving up the door like a garage.
“This is where engineering was used,” explains Erfan about the reinforced steel wooden-wolf shield door.
“It is equipped with an anti-lock, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.”
With a reasonable use of storage space and places, Joan has received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and improved planning.
“In the end, the area of the sexes is exactly what you will be selling, that is, what your real estate is valued for,” says Erfan.
“Stupidly speaking, the real estate agent will come in and make calculations based on the sexes.”
Here they were able to increase the area of sex by using quality materials that give the space the shade of luxury.
“The materials are what we touch, so they help to create an emotional relationship with the house,” says Erfan.
“No one falls in love with the electrical wire in the walls.
It is important, but does not set the strings of our hearts."
This is evidence that, for good design and enhanced metering, an apartment can turn from something common to something amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you can decide to stay.
Government approved the establishment of a Cultural Policy Commission
The Government of Russia approved the establishment of a Commission on State Cultural Policy.
The relevant regulation was published on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the main objective of the Commission would be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policies.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify tasks and prepare new programmes to implement them.
The Vice-President of the Government of the Republic of France, appointed as Head of the Commission.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
PM Dmitri Medvedev approved in 2016 a plan for the implementation of the State cultural policy strategy by 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and measures to increase the influence of Russian culture in other countries, to preserve the same cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 declined to an eight-year minimum
The increase in consumer prices in G20 countries has declined to minimum values over the past eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, referring to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
OECD estimates that inflation in June 2016 was 2 per cent lower than October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7 per cent.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a 0.1% decrease in Russia's consumer price index.
Thus, the department recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia is estimated at 4.1 per cent, according to Minfin.
The economy, however, believes that the target has already been achieved - according to the agency ' s version - is 4 per cent.
Putin warned against illegally cutting out the Baikal Taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against illegal forest destruction during the meeting on environmental development of natural Baikal territory.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donsky, noted that a bill had previously been drafted.
It permits the logging of forests during the fire-fighting period, and the Government plans to adopt it in the autumn.
In turn, the President stated that the project must be monitored to ensure that “not all things are cut out in a row” during the cut-off process.
Donska noted that the bill entails control by the MCS and the supervisory agencies.
M.S.I.: W.U.S. troops are negotiating with Donbas militias on the safe side of the command.
A regular telephone connection is established on the armed conflict in Donbass.
Combators regularly communicate with each other on their mobile phones, and they do not know about it at headquarters.
The VSU and Donbas militia have set up cell phones secretly from their high command.
This is reported on 4 August by “Strana.ua” with reference to members of a military operation in Donbassa.
According to the publication, the team commanders are familiar with the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them on the phone every day.
Communication is completely out of the question: Commanders are trying to reach some “tactical arrangements”.
Part of the result of such talks is a truce on a certain part of the front.
Journalists were aware of occasions when congratulations were received from an officer on the front line, from his formal enemy.
WSU and DNR and LNR militia have been in trenches on the line of separation since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against Donbas.
MID upsets the blocking of UNSB statements of attacks on the embassy of the RF
In the Russian foreign policy office, they are outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives who block UN Sovbez's press statements condemning the terrorist attacks of the RS Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian MID.
The agency recalled that the territory of the Embassy of Russia in Damascus on 2 August had been subjected to mortar shelling by terrorist groups, Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (the former Jabhat al-Nusra), prohibited in the FF) and Fylak Ar-Rakhman.
Bearing in mind that the international community is unanimously qualified as a “Nusra” terrorist organization, and UNSCRs call for countering this structure, the FMI noted that “it would appear, of course, that “Nusra’s terrorist attacks should meet universally unconditional and decisive condemnation and that there should be no ambiguity in the assessment of departures against diplomatic missions”.
However, as stressed in the Department, “at the third time in a month, diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, France and Ukraine on the United Nations Security Council have, on a variable basis, varied the tone of objections, covering the alleged lack of information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short draft Security Council statement to the press condemning terrorist attacks against the Russian diplomatic representation in the Syrian capital”.
The unwillingness to exercise diplomatic solidarity with us to remain in the conscience of those delegations.
“The most disturbing thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, gives them the feeling of impunity,” said the ILO, adding that “it would not be desirable for these barbarians to have the belief that someone in the Security Council with them.”
Vladimir Putin advocated limiting the number of out-of-work checks
Russian President Vladimir Putin, at the investment meeting in the Far East, stated that the number of out-of-plan inspections by entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30 per cent of the planned number, and said that it was necessary to limit the inspection time by ten days.
“External checks are usually carried out without appropriate harmonization with the Public Prosecutor ' s Office; only 2-3 per cent are agreed with the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, everything else is going on its own”, TASS quoted the President as saying.
Vladimir Putin also said that it was necessary to prohibit investigators from extracting servers and hard drives from businesses.
In addition, the President believes that business associations should be given the right to protect the interests of their members in court.
“I hope this will give some positive effect to business cases or to the breach of the entrepreneurship law,” said the Head of State.
As reported by U, the moratorium on scheduled inspections has increased the number of other types of inspections by entrepreneurs.
In May, an out-of-plan replacement (from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), raiders (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), and checks on citizens' claims (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).

Brothers struggle for a real estate empire worth more than $500 million
Two brothers fought for one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires — over $500 million — forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and builder Colin de Loutis lives in the Turak Palace three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a claim against him before the Supreme Court for the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to get out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still in a heated dispute over divorce.
Together with their mother, Anna’s brothers own 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars, purchased since their family bought a shop in Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Loutis family's property list today includes office buildings, areas under construction in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Golden Bank and in Mount Bouller and shopping centres in the suburbs.
In agreement with the late father, Colin, whom Paul describes as the “main driving force and dominant person” of the De Lutis family, owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one third of the company's assets.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul is 176 million.
The division of property and money has become a stumbling block for Paul.
“The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my view, the best parts of the property”, he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed reconciliation attempts, the first hearings in the Supreme Court were held.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business, from which Paul believes Colin has excluded it.
Colin contends that this is not the case, but he blames Paul for the incompetent management of certain facilities.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the process, he said he hoped that the dispute would be resolved.
"My Italian roots make me consider my family a top priority," he wrote.
Judicial costs are rising as a snowman: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer; both sides attracted the most prominent lawyers, including Royal Lawyer Allan Myers, and the best insolent.
Mrs. De Loutis and her late husband, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they managed milk bars and gastrons, and in the early 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a shop in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family store of jeans.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last grade of school, and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old).
Anna De Loutis says that they and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their possessions to non-conflict sons.
"Luigi often told me he didn't want the brothers to be tried," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Loutis group; Colin says that Mark received 10 million when he left the business, and Luke received 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were “dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their office. ”
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL Club Directors' Board and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGir, the best friend of the telestar.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul on Friday and their lawyers.
He answered only Colin, a text message stating that, since the case had not yet been tried in court, “I have nothing to say.”
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to file a lawsuit against me and blink the name of our family in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in evidence that he was trying to meet his brother’s requirements.
"Our father would not like to see Paul and I argue in court," he said, adding that "he still hopes to resolve the conflict."
Friday, that hope seemed to dissipate.
“The decision on our case will soon be brought in court”, Colin wrote.
The new head of Trump's office plans to limit the information to the President.
Others tried to do so and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If that's the case, he'll be the first.
“Policy” reports that the new head of the White House Office plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news from the media, hoping to keep the chief in a more calm state.
This is what reporter Josh Douzy reports.
"At a meeting held by the new head of the White House, John F. Kelly, with the head of the apparatus on his first day of work, he highlighted the main problem in the White House with President Donald Trumpe, whom he hopes to resolve: poor channels of information for the President."
Kelly told the staff that the information should go through him, either in paper form or through briefings, because the President would be better off making decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly’s diagnosis is quite true, but others have already failed in trying to calm Trump down by tracking his information.
President Trump's relationship with television came a few decades ago - and now, when he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, was outraged by the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he had received fair coverage in publications that could be convinced”, said Sam Nanberg, former Electoral Staff Adviser, in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote in "Policy" at the time that "six ex-members of the electoral headquarters to control Trump's habit of writing on Twitter had to be monitored so that the information coming to him in person would have a constant flow of praise".
Okay.
But the idea that Trump used to write on Twitter was once "controlled" is just funny.
Maybe these members of the electoral headquarters know something we don't know, for example, that if it wasn't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump never published.
If his staff had kept him out of trouble at least a few times, their efforts would not be in vain.
But no one could always keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by giving Trump material - reliable or not - which confirms their views.
"Policy" -- just to this story -- he wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly raise doubtful information to the President.
Here is an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump staff say Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially with dangerous leaks, and will not rest until he finds out who was behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone pushed the president's press release with GotNews.com, Internet-provokator Charles K. Johnson, in which the deputy head of Kathy Wells accused her of "standing behind a number of leaks" in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is always confused in Twitter about aggressive behavior, that he didn't present specific facts, or that in the past he started false accusations and then gave them up.
Trump read the article and asked about Welsh."
Goldmacher adds that the then head of Reines Pribus and the secretary of Rob Porter 'tried to build a system to manage and document the flow of paper that Trump receives'.
How did that work?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same thing.
He may be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature, and his assistants continue to fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly’s task very difficult.
The Tumen Public Prosecutor ' s Office combats HIV-dissident
The Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the ruling of the Kalinin Paradise Tumenia, which terminated criminal proceedings against a local resident who had died of HIV from a minor daughter.
According to the investigation, the child was killed because the mother was HIV-dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court relieved her of her responsibility for reconciliation with her father.
The prosecution believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished in order not to set a precedent for other HIV-dissidents.
The case concerning the resident of Tümen was initiated at 1 p.m. 109 U.S. of the F (Death by Care) in April, after the death of her three-year-old daughter from HIV 4B stage.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
“The woman did not heal herself and gave up treatment for her daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection”, explained the Tumen district prosecutor's office.
The criminal case took place at the Kalinsky Paradise of Tumenia, which decided on 25 July to terminate it.
The father asked the girl who had died, explaining that “he had forgiven the wife, had no claims against her, had done harm and had apologized”.
The prosecutor ' s office disagreed with the court ' s decision and appealed, calling for the annulment of the order to terminate the case and to refer it to a new hearing.
The girl died and the damage caused by the crime cannot be corrected.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of the doctors, refused to examine her baby and treat her with a dangerous infection," the prosecutor's office reported.
According to the supervisory authority, it must be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents will follow suit.
According to the Tumen Centre for AIDS, there are now about 12 children with HIV in the Tumen area who are not receiving medical treatment because of parental refusal.
“And this situation has already improved — in the year of the ad hoc group’s work, half the parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV have changed their minds — have been able to diagnose, have taken drugs,” said the Press Secretary of the AIDS Centre, Elena Losev.
She said that it was not possible to influence parents by law and that not all HIV-positive children were able to detect that mothers were not able to examine them, hide themselves, flee with children from hospitals.
What is the risk of HIV-dissidents?
At the end of last year, the first study of the so-called HIV dissident movement in Russia was presented by St. Petersburg sociologists.
HIV dissidents are referred to as people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take drugs.
Medical professionals and AIDS service activists call such views antimedical, and they pose a serious threat to their spread.
The Yellow Photo Session, which ended the tragedy, took place on Thursday, 3 August at the Greek Railway Station in Hmelnick.
A joyful company of young people who had been raised took a bridge over the railways, where a freight train had just stood.
A friend came up with the idea of making an effective self on the wagon roof, FACTAM reported in the Hmelnicki police communications sector.
The guy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but because of his indiscretion, he got caught behind the electric line and was instantly struck by the current.
Fortunately, this case was known to the station's dispatcher, who immediately called for an "immediate delay".
Prior to the arrival of the victim's doctors, they moved to a safe place and then hospitalized the Hmelnica Regional Clinical Hospital in Fire.
Men were diagnosed with burns of torsos from 1 to 2 degrees.
His condition is now being assessed as stable.
Law enforcement officials are reminding us that recently, extreme selfies have become increasingly popular in multi-storey roofs, bridges, and traffic.
The police call on people to be vigilant and not to allow such photos, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans in ancient Venus
In ancient Venus, there could be oceans.
That was the assumption made by French scientists.
Experts have developed a computer model that has demonstrated the formation of water on the surface of the planet, says Science News.
It was found that at the beginning of its history, Venus had developed oceans with 10 per cent more water than on Earth.
Previously, "Arguments of Weeks" said that according to the scientific hypothesis, the ocean could have existed on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Foreign experts in their studies have concluded that the water facility was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured as a result of the shooting in the park in San Francisco
Three people were injured in San Francisco by the shooting, reports Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, where there were a large number of visitors.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them picked up a weapon and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the evildoers could not be considered, since they had everything but their eyes closed.
Another was provided with medical care, after which he was released.
The third victim is minor, no details of his condition.
Dolores Park, located on the hill, is a popular place among locals and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured while shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured while trying to leave the room.
Louna's rock band will present a new album in Barnaul
The Louna rock band concert will take place in Barnaul on 17 October.
Musicians will present their new album “The Amazing New World”, which has become one of the most expected releases of the year.
The team is preparing a concept show that will be the brightest in the band's concert history.
The Wild New World is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Louna.
His name is related to the famous novel "O Wonderful New World" by O. Huxley.
The new songs do not tell the book, but talk about a society that lives under the law of anti-tutopia, “blind belief of propaganda and imposed values”.
More than 1,200 people supported the project on Planeta.ru.
Louna released her first album, "Do Bolce!" in 2010.
Two years later, musicians presented Time X and recorded the album “We Are Louna” (2013).
In autumn 2015, Louna presented a symphony orchestra in Crocus City Hall with the World Songs programme.
In Lucine Gevorkian (vocal), Vitaly Demidenko (bas guitar), Ruben Kazaryan (guitar), Sergei Ponkratev (guitar), Leonid Kinzboursky (barrabanas).
The concert will take place at Barnaul Club Pharaoh on 17 October at 19:00.
Price of tickets: from 1200 to 2,600 roubles.
Louna is one of the wanted groups on the Russian rock stage.
The collective was established in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The team has won several races of the "Dherto Duzhin" hit parade.
The Gypsies have broken through the trenches and returned to the “Millionaires Street”
Some of the most efficient Western Midland homeowners are once again at odds with the determined gypsies that have overcome the trenches that have been dug by the municipal authorities to retake the field near their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich Solihalla Street, which was called “the streets of millionaires”.
When they brought with them horses, infants, and many houses on wheels, they returned after they had been driven away no further than in May, and did not disturb them by the trenches that had been dug up by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a gap in the defence facilities and ran its vehicles across a section that was left unfettered to leave room for the tropics.
Disgruntled residents attacked the municipality of Solihall, saying that it had been “incapable to solve the problem”.
The anonymous local woman said, "They came here on Monday night after being driven out of the Bentley Hit, where they threw stones in the passers-by."
Municipality should be ashamed and forced to act because they are completely unable to solve the problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were banished, and they came back again.
More Gypsies came last night, and today perhaps even more.
“Municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks,” she added.
I live in Street Road, and I don’t like that I continue to pay the municipal tax, and the municipality can’t even put an end to it.”
One resident who wished to remain anonymous said, “This is ridiculous, we have just seen these Gypsies leaving the previous time, and this attack continues.”
And this time there was more of them, and we even saw a horse graze on the meadow.
The representative of the municipality of Solihalla said: “We know about an illegal camp on the ground near Stitsbrook Road and we cooperate with the Solihall police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them out as soon as possible.”
In order to help us collect evidence, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by telephone 101.
This gives us an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
The Crimea shares the champagne wine factory "New Light"
The new world 's wine factory of the Republic of Crimea has been decided to share in the transformation into the OAS of the "New Light of Champagne wine factory", following the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Krim Anna Anuhina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in Crimea's ownership.
The statutory capital of a shareholding society will be 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 rubes each.
The Crimea Ministry of Agriculture stated that if funds were not available for upgrading the plant for the next three years, the plant would be in danger of stopping.
Exports of major assets at the company amount to about 60-70 per cent.
The enterprise needs 1.2 billion rubes to be upgraded, and because of its organizational and legal characteristics, it is required to give 50% of its income to the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
“To get money from the owner is problematic, to talk about borrowing from large credit organizations difficult,” said the head of the Crimea Mission, Sergey Petelin, in April of this year.
The Crimea Parliament included an enterprise in the privatisation forecast for 2017.
It was suggested that it should be held and auctioned.
The source of Interfax in the Crimea authorities estimated the possible value of selling the company in $40 million, investing the investor in modernization, in another $30 million.
New Light in 2016 increased the production of game wines by 2.8 per cent compared to 2015 levels to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, New Light intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lviv Golicin as a factory for the production of playful wine in the name of the New World.
The plant is located 11 hectares [11 ha] of land.
Lower - city third graders have destroyed more than 40 tombs
The Ministry of Internal Affairs officials in the Low Town Region identified the citizens who had destroyed 46 gravestones at the cemetery of Lyskovo.
The 3rd class of the wicked ones were made up of them.
The first statement that grave plates were damaged by unknown bodies was made by Russia ' s OMC in Lyskov district on 27 June.
Twenty-four people have come to the police on this matter.
As a result, a criminal case has been initiated under article 244 of the Criminal Code, “Destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites”.
As a result of the investigation, the police found suspects and turned out to be two schoolchildren between the ages of 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing the monuments fall, and that led them to hooligan action.
Prevention activities were conducted with children and their parents.
Italy is increasing its tone towards ships of NGOs saving migrants.
Italy warned NGOs belonging to rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue their work unless they comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs fail to comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they can continue their activities," said Interior Minister Mario Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily 'Stamp'.
Minniti's warning came the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a vessel belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, suspected that its crew was actually cooperating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The Humanitarian Organization, which worked for the whole year, rejected comments on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartosio.
“For us, saving human life is and will remain a top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue to work in the search and rescue zone now,” said the organization in social media.
"We can assess all the charges now made only after we have collected all the information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Jugend Rettet vessel since October.
His crew is suspected of taking all the lifeboats on board migrants, which were sent by human traffickers directly to them, and allowing smugglers to go along with boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting is expected to take place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, so the contents of the charges that have been published in the Italian media are alleged to have occurred.
The crew is suspected of violating the orders of the Italian coast authorities, which control rescue operations in the area, rather than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct presupposes that the Juventa-type vessels will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code: “Save the Children”, the Maltese MOAS and “Pro-Activa Pro-Activa Pro-Distinctions” from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that the new rules were unnecessary but acceptable, provided that they did not entail any “significant changes or disruptions” to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign are the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
In the meantime, Minniti said that the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations in recent weeks indicated that efforts to support Libyan coast guard and co-operation with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In the last days we began to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, the Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict."
The authorities of the Russian Federation have recently significantly intensified their policy in the Libyan direction, and the delegations of the rival Libyan parties have frequented visits to Moscow.
The head of the Russian contact group on the Internal Settlement at the Ministry of Interior and Gosdam, the Assistant Head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Dengoov, described the goals of Moscow in the region and of whom he is taking the bet.
The contact group you lead on Libya is hardly known.
Let's say the Ukrainian contact group knows all about it.
And here's a secret curtain.
What exactly are you doing, what are your goals?
The Contact Group was established at the initiative of the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of the Interior.
Its activities are directed by Deputy Foreign Affairs Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov (Duma Deputy from Chechnya. - "U").
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State of Vyacheslav Volodyna.
The formation of the group was followed by the detention of 11 people in Libya by the Russian tanker Mehanik Chebotarev (in September 2015).
We were thinking of a way to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military professionals, representatives of the State, was established and our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did you manage to lead her?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from the Mechanic of Chebotariev.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups facing each other in the Libyan conflict - and Tripoli (based on the UN recognized Government, led by Faiz Saraja. - "U") and Tobruk (residence of Parliament, which opposes the Government and supports Marshal Khalifu Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya. - "U".
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (Livia Deputy Prime Minister - "U"), we were able to agree quickly on the release of Russian sailors.
It was then decided to make more effective use of these contacts, to establish a contact group.
Its task is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict, we have dialogue with all.
How many are in the contact group, and how many are in Libya all the time?
The contact group now consists of five persons.
There are people who have experience in the work of the forces, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to make up a team of specialists for the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of the Republic of Iran.
There is no permanent presence in Libya of our staff, which is not necessary.
There are Russian military advisers in Libya now, instructors.
And if so, which side?
There are no Russian military professionals in Libya.
All discussions and publications do not correspond to reality.
But your contact group has former military personnel...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or those closed to a certain point for us cities such as Misurat (where militia units are based, played a role in bringing together Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi in 2011 and markedly intensified in subsequent years).
We came to Missouri in January of this year.
We were intimidated, told that it was full of Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyse the real military potential, who is responsible for why such rumours are, in fact, the role of Islamists.
In Misurata, we met with all the representatives of the troops that were involved in the destruction of IG in Sirt (in December 2016, the city on the Mediterranean coast was visited by fighters of the Islamic State-U-Russian-prohibited.
We wanted to look at them, to meet them, to check the information that they were the ones who played a crucial role in the destruction of IGs in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed them to himself.
And what conclusion have you reached?
"The Islamic State" in Libya didn't defeat Haftar?
That's not what he did.
Haftar performed operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And the IG in Sirte was fought by structures that were subordinated to the Government in Tripoli.
And by the way, we've invited people to Russia who conducted this anti-terrorist operation.
And they arrived - the visit was extended from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation was admitted to the Council of the Federation, Duma, MID and Rosgwardia.
As we understand it, you are in all Libyan regions and you may imagine the sentiments of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think that the ceasefire agreements reached in late July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj could be implemented?
Or once again, as has happened repeatedly in the past, the agreements will be torn down, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to take power alone?
For us, the fact that Saraj and Haftar had agreed to another meeting was a good signal, not long ago that was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders have responded extremely negatively to each other.
As for Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe.
We encountered this situation when we were in Misurat, and Haftar was on board the Russian air carrier Admiral Kuznetsov on that day.
It was a coincidence.
But they didn't believe it in Misurat.
We were told, "You must be very brave people to come to us today."
But our task is just to show that we do not only support Haftar, we are having a dialogue with all key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You've been talking to Haftar.
Does understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional level facilitate the fact that it has been taught twice in the USSR?
And by the way, does Haftar speak Russian?
He's Russian, if he knows, very much.
But what he taught us certainly facilitates dialogue with him.
And by the way, he's not the only one.
When we speak to the military in Tripoli and Missouri, we meet generals who have studied in either Russia or the Soviet Union.
And there they are, speaking Russian.
And they're pulling towards Russia, kind of nostalgia on it.
Do you consider it likely that the arms embargo imposed on Libya will be lifted soon?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but as I have already said, we do not take sides in this conflict and we do not wish to arm others at the expense of others.
We would like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
With regard to the arms embargo, Libyans are constantly calling for Russia to make a way out of it.
Libya is now actively advancing the constitutional process.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions, achieve internal consensus.
The elections should then be held, as discussed at the meeting of Saraj and Haftar.
If elections are held and the legitimate authority is finally elected (and no party now has such status), the issue of lifting the arms embargo may be raised at the United Nations in Sovbez.
To raise this issue is now pointless and dangerous, and will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
The media has recently reported that Italy, which has encountered the problem of African refugees from Libya, feels abandoned to the fate of its allies from the EU.
Can Moscow in this situation help Italian partners by using their ties with the Libyans?
How realistic is it, for example, that Haftar's troops will control the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers moving immigrants to Europe?
It's a very timely question.
We're actively working on it.
Italians need support from Russia because Moscow has a dialogue with both Haftar and Saraj, and Misurata and the south.
On this issue, tribes in southern Libya play a major role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about crossing the flows of migrants in distant ways?
I mean, on parole, did the buses run back, where Nigerian migrants go?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in continuing these flows.
We hope to be able to bring the Southerners together in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
To begin with, however, we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist who advocates the introduction of Shariah norms.
How radical is he?
Would that be an obstacle to a relationship with Russia or the West?
I will express my personal opinion of him.
In my view, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself is in the position that Libya must be a perfectly normal country - a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he's also actively fighting terrorists.
Where did he get that reputation?
It was created by those countries that did not want Russia to communicate with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, where there is legislative, executive and judicial authority.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other public structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not going there.
And we mixed all their cards and started to communicate actively with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has concluded a cooperation agreement with Libya's State Oil Company, NOC.
The director of NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosnefti Igor Sechin made a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil from Rosnefti took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess I'll resell it.
What other economic interests do Russia have in Libya?
In plans to resign the contracts concluded at Muammar Qaddafi.
These include previous arrangements in the transport sector (railway construction), energy (electrication) and a number of others.
And the Libyans have something to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So this is, like with Iran, an oil-for-service scheme?
I don't know what the scheme is, I don't really deal with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main one.
We're actually doing peacekeeping work there.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans agree on each other so that they can establish order, and Libya has ceased to be an enabling environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task of helping the Libyan people and disposing of terrorists.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan Security Committee, who said that no Russian and other former USSR members were there to date.
He said that he had about 50,000 phone records of members of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - "U") and the Russian language does not sound there.
And of which countries, then, are these fighters?
I wouldn't want to go into these details.
Then the question is formulated differently.
How many Islamic militants in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are practically no Libyans among them, no more than 5%.
The rest are futures.
Can Moscow hold intra-Leivia talks on Paris' example?
That's the plan.
We are having intensive talks with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have expressed their readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
Several visits are still to be made, and I hope that there will be clarity about the time and place of negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, the charity collected money for a dear gift to a sick boy
At the Melichovo Sub-mask Museum, nine-year-old boy Sasha Macola, with DCP, brain hydrocephaly and complete blindness, will receive a special escape route on 5 August.
A useful presentation by Saša Minister of Culture of Moscow Oksan Kosarov and the director of the museum Constantine Bobkov.
The money for the trainer was collected during the "Do Not Stop Doing Good" charity marathon, which was held in Melikhova on 15 July on the Day of Remembrance of Chekov.
Before the marathon in the museum, they received a letter from Sasha, who lives in Manushkino Čechovské district, saying, "I can't see my eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I would very much like to get a gift from the treadmill to make my feet strong, and I'd a little bit learn to walk."
And now Sasha's dream has come true!
After the award to the museum, the Concert Postscriptum will be held, a well-known pianist, deserving Russian artist Alexander Gindin will perform popurirs from popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melikhov were choirs of the Woznesensian Dawidov Desert, ministers of Master Ili Drozdyhin, students of the Moscow Conservatory named P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Academy of the Name Gnesich, artists of the Melikhov Theatre "Czech Studio".
For visitors, auctions were held, book fairs and charity sales of souvenirs with a marathon logo.
The Melikhovo Museum took the initiative to make the Day of Remembrance of the Czech Republic on 15 July a single day of charity at all the museums of Podmoskovya.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevska Zitomir district near the local football stadium fired several shots at the adolescents who were there.
According to the suspect, he was upset by the noise, and was reported by FACTAM in the Communications Department of the Police of the Zhitomir Region.
After that, the man went to a café not far from here.
He had a conflict in the building, during which a man used rubber bullets to shoot one of the visitors.
A 34-year-old victim has received the necessary medical care, and there is no threat to his life.
Police and rapid medical assistance arrived at the scene, but the arrow was hidden by that time.
The law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day on 2 August.
The man couldn't explain his actions.
He's got a device to fire rubber bullets that's being sent to the forensics.
Criminal proceedings under article 296 (holiday) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine have been initiated in this regard.
The detainee is facing imprisonment for a term of 3 to 7 years.
Remember, there was an shooting attack in Kiev, Lukijanovka, near Tatarska Street on the night of 28 July.
Michel Carter's arraignment for the reports that triggered Conrad Roy's suicide.
The resident of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment for causing the suicide of her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, by means of text messages and telephone calls.
Michel Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to spend 15 months of his term behind bars and another 5 years of probation.
Carter was found guilty of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy in June, who killed himself on 13 July 2014.
Father Roy said at the hearings on Thursday, "My family was killed in grief.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain at large until appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers said that she and Roy had been suffering from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream shirt, listened to the sentence of the stand, burned his hands, and dropped his eyes.
"In her actions, she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She didn't admit responsibility," she said.
"She has not shown repentance."
But lawyer Carter said that it was a “tragic case that she deeply regrets”.
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that he felt that her “age, maturity or even mental illness had not affected her significantly”.
The Prosecutor read out Roy Lynn Roy's mother's statement, saying, "It's not been one day since I've mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm doing - I'm trying to support his sister, despite all the pain that remains with us forever," it says.
Sister Roya Camdin Roy said that she was constantly perceiving that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunts.
"Abstaining the man who has been with me ever since I was born is the pain that remains with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This would seem to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that would provide for the responsibility of counseling a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of coal gas poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case drew the attention of the entire country when it became known that it was driven to the suicide of Carter’s message.
"You can hang, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife I don't know is a lot of ways," she wrote in several messages two weeks before he died while he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "You just have to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to get attention with Roy's death, and he stopped her from communicating with the press to keep her from getting what she wanted.
The lawyers' views on this have been divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy two years later.
30-year-old Knox published her own opinion in the Los Angeles Times, stating: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and assistance, not prisons."
Eugene Bogchev, "I let Langford go like a flying bird."
One of the best basketball players in the WTB League, 33-year-old Keith Langford, left UNIX.
The U.S. Attorney's Office of Intelligence commented on the president of UNIXA, Evgeny Bochev.
Keith made this decision under family circumstances, said Evgeny Bogchev.
He's got a little kid, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played UNIKSE for three seasons, and in each match, he showed a high level, and he stood at all 100%.
So I let him go like a flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and his career.
Keith Langford played in the cascacan club for three years, winning silver from the Single League, 2015/16.
In the season-2016/17, he received the prize for the most successful Euroleague season.
He was dialing 21.75 points on average for a match.
This result has been the second since the 2004 award was established.
Langford, who won the award also in 2014, became the second player in the history of the Euroliga to win the prize more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with the Chinese Shenchen, informs Eurohoops.
An American is expected to enter into a two-year contract of $5 million.
Langford will be the second Euroliga star in July to become the Chinese champion.
In the past, Jannis Burusis, an ex-centre of Panatinaikos, moved to China’s CBA.
A sunburned tourist from Podmoskowa was evacuated by helicopter in Adigea
Today, the Adigean rescuers evacuated the upper part of the city by helicopter from a submersible tourist who received the strongest solar burns.
The man rested at the Fist shelter, which is 1,600 feet [1,6,000 m] high.
The 27-year-old tourist had increased pressure, as well as difficulty breathing.
Pre-diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
Rescuers were approached by the leader of the group, who said that the man had been burned on the march.
Audis to be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the announcement by the Audis, BMW announced that it would propose to upgrade software to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The Chairman, BMW, stated that the company considered that “there were more intelligent ways than driving restrictions” in view of European cities, including Munich, where BMW is located, which considered the possibility of banning or limiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Daymler said on Thursday that it modifies three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies called their own response.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with carbon dioxide regulations.
But nitrogen oxides that eject diesel engines are considered carcinogens and may cause asthma.
The cost for auto-producers of equipment that neutralizes diesel exhaust also increases, and it becomes difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
While German auto-producers are under close attention, Chancellor Angela Merkel's Government has also accused it of promoting powerful auto-producers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies try not to repeat the error of Volkswagen, which has hidden the use of so-called “damage devices”, which at the time of testing could adjust the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the rules and are excluded under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen leaders were convicted, the rest being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former Head of the Thermodynamics Department was arrested in Germany as part of the Audi Engine Development Team.
Former manager, Zakkeo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, and therefore not protected from extradition and may be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of setting up a system to circumvent European emission regulations and expanded the investigation previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may create serious problems for Volkswagen: the producer of elite cars is the source of a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen's income.
In Astrakani, a coffee shop visitor paid off with false money
The police received a report from the bank's office worker on the transfer of funds from the general examination, a suspected coupon of 5,000 rubles.
A study carried out at the Expert Crime Centre revealed that it was false.
According to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, the banknote was paid by one of the visitors to the coffee shop.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a device to determine the authenticity of the bills.
Police officers are currently being identified as involved in the manufacture and sale of a counterfeit CB-RF ticket.
Such offences are punishable by imprisonment of up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs calls on residents of the Astrakhan region to be careful in their financial transactions; it is recommended that workers be set up instruments to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found a planet of Hades where even iron can float
For the first time, after studying the stratosphere of the giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were amazed at its temperature, which could evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts noted that the water molecules are so heated by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
Hubble's telescope sealed the radiation of the water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the planet's atmosphere to glow in an infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called “hot jupeters” -- gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet of the solar system, but ten times closer to the parent star.
This year, only 1.3 "earthdays" last on the exoplanet, and its gas shell is scaled up to nearly 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provença and South France, but now fears are voiced that climate change is threatening it.
Lavanda grew worse because of dry weather and insect diseases, causing constant headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute at Provance, says: “Lavanda is indeed under threat because in recent years the plant has felt the effects of climate change: in the spring and especially in the autumn of the rains it has become much smaller.
This affects the life expectancy of lavender.
And there's also little cicadas jumping on the leaves of insects carrying microbacteria; in very dry weather, they get very much."
There's a lot on the map.
Lavanda not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very needed in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says, "We have small, underdeveloped, weakened or not, instead of very long circles with a large number of large colors.
That's why we have fewer parts that contain air oil."
The solutions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and decoupling of evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying of clay and water protection plants and extracting more drought-resistant varieties.
Ambassador Zimnej University-2019 met with FRED schoolchildren
The two-time hockey world champion, Ambassador Alexander Semin of Winter University-2019, met with the early hockey players and gave autographs to the sick.
The meeting was held in the tent of Winter Universities-2019 as part of the thematic week on hockey with shabbas.
Any tent visitor could ride on horseback on a playground with artificial ice.
In addition, estaphets, Victorians and games have been organized to play souvenir games and to break up the aerobics federation.
Fifty schoolchildren attended the event.
Alexander Semin advised the children to do as much as possible on sports grounds and stressed that the most important thing at the beginning of their education was hard work and a tremendous desire to play hockey.
“It’s good that there’s a space in Krasnoyarsk such as the Winter Universities-2019, where beginners can ask direct questions to team coaches,” said the champion.
Note that Ambassadors of Winter University-2019 are helping to promote students' sports and healthy lifestyles among the Reds.
The universals will work throughout the summer season until 25 September, reports the Winter Universe Directorate-General's press service- -2019.
Medvedev’s words were commented on in Gosdep
US State Department official Heather Nauert, commenting at the briefing on the words of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of the Russian Federation, said that it was necessary to find an area to interact with Russia.
She said that such areas should be found in order to “enhance bilateral interaction”.
Nauert cited the Syrian Armistice Agreement as an example of such successful cooperation.
We're two nuclear super-Powers.
"And people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other," said the diplomat.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev’s claim about the full trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said that, she has the right to speak, but there is nothing more I can say about it," said the representative of Goddep.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump had signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new sanctions package, the head of the Government of the RF Medvedev stated that Washington had declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, ending the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that United States sanctions would take place for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister, the U.S. Department of Cleansing, believes Trump.
A missing bodybuilder in Podmosk found a stranger's memory loss.
Bodybuilder Shamil Hanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on 25 July under very hot circumstances: he left the car lounge to go to the toilet.
For seven days he was found without success by his acquaintances and locals.
And Shamil was in a foreigner's home in Ramensky.
He was found naked in his master's bathroom.
The Dagestan athlete couldn't explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport went missing.
The announcement of his disappearance helped to establish his identity.
The doctors on the phone recorded partial memory loss and brain trauma from Hanmett, according to the Mash newspaper.
Perhaps the athletes are waiting for other surprises.
The criminals who kidnapped Shamil were probably already in his apartment, where he was also stolen from.
July ' s oil revenues exceeded the forecast of 7.4 billion roubles
In fact, oil-gas revenues from July 2017 exceeded an estimate of 7.4 billion rubles, the Ministry of Finance reported.
The excess, as explained by the department, was mainly due to a higher US dollar exchange rate on the ruble than the average monthly value of June used for the assessment, as well as the excess of actual gas production and the volume of exports of projected oil products.
“The deviation of the Federal Budget ' s petroleum revenues from the monthly assessment, in line with the Federal Federal Budget Act 2017-2019, is projected at +40.2 billion rubies in August 2017”, said the Minfina communication.
Thus, the total amount of foreign exchange in the domestic currency for the period 7 August to 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion roubles.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign exchange would be equivalent to 2.07 billion rubes.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in foreign exchange purchase operations by Minfin Russia.
Each working day during the specified period, the CB will enter into transactions for foreign exchange purchases at organized trades of the Moscow Stock Exchange equally during the trading day.
The foreign currency acquired will be credited to the Federal Treasury account in the Central Bank.
The killing of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Staff of the weekly Riodose newspaper usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the continuing war of drug traffickers.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told that they should change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking their children with them to an office where they had already thrown a grenade or leaving their homes in 2009.
The security experts wrote three words on a board hanging in a room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name the names for each column - evidence is not needed, suspicions and internal feelings will suffice.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to be in government or cartel custody, a whole list of perverts who are making the work of creating chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence has not been a breakthrough, nor has there been an increasing number of journalists in the country: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nyeto held his post in December 2012; 589 after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and this year at least seven people have been killed in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspiration, co-founder Javier Valdes Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdes wrote in one of his many books on violent drug crimes.
His absence is very acute, although his presence is widespread, a large photograph of Valdez pointing to the middle finger, with the inscription “Justice” hanging on the facade of the building “Riodos”; two reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing shirts depicting his smile, face in eyes or his business masters.
The seminar is held less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, and paranoia.
Although the special federal prosecutor ' s office was established in 2010 to investigate journalists, only two cases were investigated, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of drug trafficking and organized crime killings each year, journalists are rarely tried.
Riodos Journalists insist that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed in grief, although much more dangerous now.
Without information on the killers, without justice from the security talks at the meetings, Ibarra says.
"It's really stupid to waste time on this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left the Riodos office in the capital city of Culiacane.
He was only able to drive a few blocks before two men stopped his red Toyota King; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's name, which means "The Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and smashed it nearby.
Valdes was 50 years old.
He had a wife and two grown children.
Rumors usually spread rapidly around Kuliacan.
But about Valdez, virtually everyone is silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions struggle to fill a vacuum.
Let us not say that every day in the streets of Sinaloa, one or more people are killed or that the cemetery is filled with two - story mausoleums, more than many living people’s homes.
Let's forget for a minute that the state of calm is simply when one of the cartels takes control of the coastal state with important ports and routes of drug trafficking leading to the United States.
Even though Valdez knew well about the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, was overwhelmed by the guilt of not being able to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped the murder.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso Lopez, the leader of a rival cartel faction that fought with Guzman's sons.
The publication may have pissed off the sons; the people who were supposed to be gang members bought all the copies as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he didn't make Valdez leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that wrote about the same story was captured.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
For so long, his friends and colleagues thought that he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste, and in 2003 he and five colleagues founded Riodos, sold his $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to do journalism without affecting the topic of drugs”, said Bohorkes.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest publication, sales and advertising revenues.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports, not because of censorship, but because they were attracted to readers that they could read about what no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after her founding, Riodose won the prestigious María Murs Cabo Award for the journalistic work in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Award for bravery in the Mexican drug investigation, wherever it led.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the award of the CPJ.
The drug trade in Sinaloa is "this is the way of life", he said last October in an interview with Rompevento TV.
"You've got to take the job of being a journalist, or you're just a fool."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodos miss Valdes, a joke who fought like a porter, a friend, generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to stand in the living.
They relied on his order.
He should always have worn his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask, "Did he lose his love for the order of once established?"
His death caused them to question their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you know their wives, their children, their legal business, and underground airports for the transport of drugs.
"These things were fucked," said Bohorkes.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self - censorship and self - preservation.
We need to trust our instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says Editor Riodos Andres Villareal, is that "probation can be deceived... and that's when what happened to Javier happens."
The old rules, he says, are no longer in force in Sinaloa - like Tamaulipas, Veracrus, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of profitable smuggling routes, weak public institutions and corrupt officials.
Landshaft changes all the time.
In a room where Riodoses gathered for security training, hundreds of phones were suddenly banned: several days earlier, it was known that spy programmes sold exclusively to Governments were used in Mexico to monitor journalists and public activists.
Two police officers outside are hiding in a tree shadow of 104 degrees Fahrenheit [40 ° C].
They were tasked by the State Government to protect the Riodos office, which is located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois district of Kuliakan.
Some journalists were half-hearted to ask whether the police included 50 per cent of the officials in the order, of whom the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that was de facto controlled by drug trafficking gangs.
In the near Ríodosé issue, three main topics were to be considered.
It's a murder at Sinaloa's brother's former boxing champion Julio Cezar Chavez.
They also had government expenditures concentrated in the governor ' s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of Kuliakan's most expensive restaurants, a block away from the D.A.'s office.
It was not officially announced who had been abducted or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant at the same time by drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a policy belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated all levels of power for almost the past century.
Recently, strong allegations of corruption have been brought against several PRI governors.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when Guzman's son, El Chapo, slipped from the military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have looked for a column of Valdez with the most reliable information about the abduction.
"We would have known what had happened earlier," said 46-year-old Villareal, for his artistic body called El Flaco.
"Today all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office is now used as a poster and sticker store against the killings of journalists, because the staff have become what they never thought they would be: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went to the local prosecutor's office for a demonstration the next morning.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in Michoakan State in the west of the country three days after Valdes was killed.
They found a burned body, and the authorities said it was based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists spoke louder, organized protests, and wrote "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and the walls of the houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington trying to obtain international support in the Valdes case.
In a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after Valdes Ramirez was killed, she accused the authorities of spying for journalists and ordering their killings for telling the truth.
After that, she asked her not to be given any more tasks in highlighting the Government ' s activities, fearing that her anger would harm her objectivity.
Valdez has said many times that journalists in Mexico are “encircled” by organized crime, its accomplices in government and a diverse society.
He wrote in his latest book Drug Journalism that reporters are not simply killed by drug gangs; they do so on the orders of politicians and security services in conspiracies with organized crime.
The Press Protection Committee “Article 19” believes that half of the attacks against journalists last year were carried out by order of the police and government officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez says.
Of course, killing scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body, they found a note, allegedly written by the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and earphones lay near her severed head.
Some publications chose to close as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent, Miroslav Bric, was killed in March.
Others continue to act as El Maniana of Nuevo Laredo after her leader was killed in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed drug cartels through a editorial on page 1, entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have left their home states or even their country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they continue to see danger in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently happened with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in Mexico's apartment three months after the escape from Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work are balanced daily between risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits he's afraid to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, midnight, when the last issue was ready for the press, the publishers of Riodos sat on the sidewalk next to the office and had a beer when their phones rang at once.
A series of firefights between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan left 19 corpses behind, according to confirmed figures.
The war continued to erupt, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted news on the Riodos website on their cell phone.
The next day we had to remake the first page.
The sirens were picked up nearby, another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorquez saw whether the police guard was ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it at all.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the late founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the entire Sinaloa, the Riodos officers continued his case.
"How can you think of shutting yourself down," said Bohorkes, "if on the same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her to the street to do a report?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, though terrifying.
Researchers said that the first found remains of an incredible rhino-size creature discovered by a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts called it “Mono Lisa among dinosaurs”.
It was so well preserved that they could even determine that the color of his cherry skin was red and brown, and to say that it had a sort of dark past.
The report, published in Modern Biology, described it as “the most well preserved of Tyreofor in the history of inventions and one of the best copies of dinosaurs in the world”.
This is a recently discovered copy of a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of a minor period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition has bewildered the researchers who call him “excellently remarkable”.
This digestive tireophorus is the most well preserved fossilized species in the history of discovery, according to articles in the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Funk when he was working in the Millennium Mine of Sankor near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be different from the environment, and decided to look more closely.
The excavations they discovered were sent to the Royal Tyrellian Paleontological Museum.
The next six years were the work of detecting an animal inside the earth’s depth with a mass of 2,500 feet (1,100 kg).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the end result can be demonstrated.
“It’s easy to hide, and you can almost believe he’s asleep,” said the leading author, Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrellian Paleontological Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
“He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well preserved copies of dinosaurs – Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.”
While studying his skin, researchers discovered that it was grassy, despite its covering and similarity to a walking tank, it seemed to be in considerable danger from the flesh - eating dinosaurs.
This powerful vest-covered dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used protective equipment known as protective paint, which is also used by many animals today.
This would allow him to blend faster into the environment and avoid meeting with the enemy, experts say, assuming that he was being hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This substance at 110 million years of age, belonging to the family of nodosaurs, was widely publicized in the May press, and is now on display at the Royal Tyrellian Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta marmitchelli in honor of the museum laboratory of Mark Mitchell, one of the members of a group that spent more than 7,000 hours digging it up.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international group of scholars to document the painting and form of the garlic and the armored plates on his body.
They discovered a protective dye, a widespread method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than the lower side.
Although protective colouring is well distributed, opening is a surprise because the size of Borealopelta is significantly higher than the size of the currently living animals with protective colour.
It may be assumed that this dinosaur has been hunted so actively by fleshy dinosaurs that evolution has chosen to mask confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the modern coloured animals, such as deer, zebras, or bronchials, are much smaller and are more accessible, indicating that nodosaurus had to fight seriously for survival.
“The serious threat posed by predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur vest shows how dangerous Melov dinosaurs were,” said Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dry dinosaur also indicates that its skin was to be red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, seeking information about his life, including the preserved contents of his digestive tract, to find out that he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was taken into the sea, where it sunk and its back down to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely spreading far deeper than they are now.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it will completely cover the preserved shingle skin, and at the same time it has been completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal,” said Brown.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it looked at back then, in the early mistletoe period.
You don’t have to use the imagination to recreate it, you just need to sneak away, and you can almost believe that it’s sleeping.”
The Melo period is an era when giant terropods, giant dinosaurs standing on two legs, roamed the earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tyrannnosaver Rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, a tireofor could be hunted by one of his formidable ancestors.
These include an acrocantosaurus, a 38 - foot (1.5 m) monster weighing six tons.
Scientists whose latest discoveries are published in Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after death and mummified in il.
The substance was found by Sean Funk when the millenium mine was located near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to museum staff, this is the world's most well-preserved tireophorus, along with the skin and the vest, and it's a target, from the face to the femurs.
On average, these beings reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
They were characterized by two 20-inch spikes from the shoulders.
Researchers believe that this digestive tireophorus has been difficult to follow, now being Canada, until the river spilling into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its vest with accuracy to the smallest detail.
The fossil remains of this particular specimen have been so well preserved that the remains of the skin are still covered by the Bulgarian armored plates along the skull of the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, the degree of security is “rarely like winning a lottery. ”
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The fossils of the skin are still covered by the bong - shaped armored plates that resembling the animal’s skull.
His right front leg is stretched along his side, five fingers pointing up.
I can count the combs on his sole."
Mikhailu Saakashvili made it to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, former head of Georgia and then Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did so without documents confirming his identity and nationality.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish edition Television Republic, which posted a video on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili gave an event to commemorate the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler’s troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not know Polish, although he tried to begin speaking in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician addressed the subject of Georgia's cooperation with Poland and spoke about Ukraine.
That Ukraine ' s migration service had deprived him of his nationality, the opal politician learned that he was in the United States.
How he managed to fly across the transatlantic area without documents is not yet known.
Former Odessa Governor Mikhail Saakashvili stated that his signature on a questionnaire to obtain Ukrainian citizenship had been forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
Investigation period in the case of Weinziher and Olhovik extended until January
Advance investigation into Renova group co-owner Evgenie Olhovik and Head of Energy Holding T Plus Boris Weinziher was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court considered extending the house arrest of accused persons.
The representative of the SC at the meeting reported on the decision to extend the preliminary investigation for the last time.
“The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to withdraw and conduct extensive reviews of documents, as well as to carry out investigations in the territory of several RF actors”, the investigator said.
He added that suspects regularly provided bribes to the Komi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at no less than a billion roubles.
According to the investigation, Weinziher, Olhovik, as well as the former head of the ZAO Integrated Energy Systems Mikhail Slobodin, who headed Wympelkom until 5 September, handed over bribes to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi for setting the most favourable tariffs for heat and electricity and for creating favourable conditions for business.
Weinziher and Olhovik were detained, staged in Siktivkar and arrested for two months, and Slobodan fled from the investigation and was declared federal wanted.
How did one activist know the answer to the question “Whose streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrel was shaken to the depths of her soul.
Only a day after her arrival in New York as part of a tour of St. Louis' birthday, she was sitting on a bed in an Airbnb rented apartment, watching a Facebook tape on her phone.
She pushed herself into the position of someone in high school.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid, and he's still lying in the middle of the street."
Noting that none of her tapes got this information, puzzled, she closed the Facebook and opened the Twitter.
In her tape, there were many users with no @TheePharoah.
A real-time rapper tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's lifeless body, spread out in the street, where it will be located for four hours.
“It’s savagery,” thought Ferrel.
But death wasn't new to her and her circle.
She hung up the phone, and later in the evening, she went back to the tweets that there were people going to the Canfield Drive.
There were photographs of a warning tape and of people screaming and of a man claiming to be Brown's father, who cried, "The Ferguson police officer just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protestors with a barking dog.
In another video, another cop said, "I'll kill you all ... animals!"
“This is an unusual situation”, Ferrel said, according to her own memories.
"It's not a murder like the ones we're used to and can be called typical.
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and wept."
She took a return flight and flew home the next day.
When she landed at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that they were both going to Ferguson for the next morning.
What happened to Ferrrell and Ferguson in the next three years became the theme of the new documentary “Whose Streets?” which will be released on August 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the point of view of the people living in the community and filling the streets, requiring answers.
While Ferrel was driving to Ferguson with a daughter dressed in flowers and a wreath under the color, they remembered a conversation that had led to countless times earlier this morning, “the experiences of the blacks and their situation”.
She said, "Do you remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed?
We are now going to Ferguson because a police officer killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong.”
"I couldn't help but take it," Ferrel said later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of what has happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and learn about it.
It should not only understand activism and organization well, but also understand the different levels of Black experience and their situation, and what we must do to be free to be free.
Even if I can provide her with a environment in which she can't personally face obvious racism, she's no different from any other black girl.
I feel that I would have done her a bad service if I had kept her from doing so."
When they arrived in Ferguson, the first stop they made was at South Florissant Road, a site across the street from a police station, which had become something like a tent camp, while activists were waiting for reports of a non-accused officer named Darren Wilson.
There Ferrrell and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped give them away to protestors.
In his mind, Ferrrell took the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism changed completely after 9 August”, she said, noting that as a student of the University of Missouri-Saint-Louis, she was the President of the Association of Sanitary Students, representatives of national minorities, and was engaged in food justice and health inequalities among Black communities.
"I had no experience as an organizer.
This has come to itself.”
A few weeks later, Ferrrell met Saba Folayan, one of her co-directors.
Folayan said that she and her chief operator, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer, simply wanted to document the events.
Ferrel wondered, “Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story that can be played?”
This skepticism has been taught by many, often white people, who have come into the community to benefit from its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We have heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson do not come to the centre of attention, and we wanted to do so differently.”
By that time, Folayan had joined with her co-director, Damon Davis, a local artist known for her activism on death row.
His involvement aroused sympathy for the project with Ferrrell, and six other locals with whom the team of Project Whose Streets maintained contact over the years following the murder of Brown.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
“This has been most important to me, as these people will be represented, because this is how I will be represented.”
Although the aim of the project was not to focus on the experience of Ferrrell, in an effort to show that the movement “is not about a rescue leader, but about how the community is united”, Folayan said, was the most open-minded of the film.
As a result, “Whose Streets?” shows the sudden personal aspects of life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrel said, laughing about the first time she saw a finished product.
“But I understood that when you do this work and you humanize black people, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrrell's history again discusses and emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the Black Life Movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag in social networks after killing Black Teen Treyvon Martin in 2012 - belong to homosexuals.
“Black-skinned homosexual women in decision-making positions support all this movement,” says Ferrel. “All because we fight on several fronts all the time.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden.”
Folayan agreed, noting that “the movement is in fact supported by black women and a multitude of homosexual black women”.
Nevertheless, she insists that “this is not a case of positive discrimination”, and that Ferrrell was not chosen as the central character of the film because of her distinctive features.
"She was the man who awakened this energy," she said.
“On the other hand, it’s not a coincidence that it came first, because when”
You can feel her energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, there has been no film camera for a long time, but there remains a complex racial link between the community and the police.
Ferrrell will be on probation two and a half more years for crossing the road during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place, which it calls home, simply “Bardak”.
She's still holding onto the stuff she learned when she left Ferguson's street three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Two Salvadoran football players disqualified for US taste
The Salvadoran football players Henry Romero and Darwin Serena received long disqualifications for non-portual conduct.
During the quarter-final match of the Golden Cup of North and Central American and Caribbean Football (CONCAF), Salvadorans were bitten by American players.
Henry Romero's lawyer was the first to stand out.
The Salvadoran bit the attacker Josie Altidor, then pinched him by the chest.
Then the half-protector, Serena, was bitten by Omar González, a U.S. defender at the corner.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Serena was disqualified for six.
The meeting itself ended with an American 2-0 victory, according to Goal.com.
Coincidence: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
At the center of the Freedman Gallery in New York City, people's faces hang from the ceiling on the wire -- white, black and brown, something unsuspectingly similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by an artist named Heather Dewey-Harborg from cheek swabs and hair clips sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent cuts from Fort Levenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year term for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called the Emerging Similarity.
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art unites technology, information and art, and Manning, a woman transsexual and prominent dissident, whom Barack Obama reduced sentence only three days before the end of his presidency.
Having analysed the DNA obtained from Manning and used it to create three-dimensional portraits of people with such a genome, Dewey Harborg has created a profound, though difficult, manifestation of not only the plasticity of DNA data, their various interpretations and the inherent determinants of these interpretations, but also the concept of identity.
Manning, born Bradley Edward, but since she was a teenager, openly said that she thought she was a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Espionage, Computer Fraud and Thieves Act.
Her photos in prison were unavailable, so there was only one photo of her: a grainy black-and-white self, where Manning in platinum thin wig, apparently feeling awkward, was behind the wheel of a car; with this photograph she was associated with.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg successfully completed its 2012 Project "Seeings of Strangers".
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people by means of judicial evidence of the type of cucumbers and food section, separating DNA from the garbage and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," Dewey Haggorg explained in a preliminary presentation of a new exhibition for the press.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait of her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her prison museum became pen pals and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote the book "Breakdown Image," illustrated by Shoily Canungo, who depicted how in the future the president would mitigate Chelsea's punishment and then he could visit the exhibition himself.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning only a few days after the book went out in the light turned out to be a pleasant surprise after seven difficult years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something profound and powerful about the exhibition being opened right now, when Donald Trump declares war on people who reveal secret information in the government, and invents new ways to arouse in Twitter the hostility that he has to alleviate.
When Dewey Harborg was asked to match it all in time, she said, "there's nothing happens by chance."
In a statement by an artist on a gallery wall, the huge signature of Manning at the bottom (with a heart over the point “i” in her name) calls for an end to “automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture”.
On the opposite side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar from a Q, G, and A.
Having included 200 letters (or nucleotides, as a scholarly worded artist), Dewey Harborg hoped to show how amazingly we all look, in any case according to our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey Harborg; her 2007 video "False Memories" was also displayed here.
"The DNA data can tell us many different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition in one room is the comic book novel mentioned above.
It features King Kong-style Manning above the U.S. Correctional barracks with a loudspeaker in hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it is written.
"Then don't ever shut up."
"It's a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me," says an artist welcoming us from Philadelphia.
"I still have ants on my skin when I talk about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition in person - as it was transparently depicted in comic books - but when she comes, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genome simulators, gathered as a crowd of protesters.
This was also done deliberately, like everyone at the exhibition up to the height (5,2) of Manning, on which the gandas were painted by genetic gapplosing groups.
"I'd rather hang them on walls, but right now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," says Dewey Harborg on portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like the movement behind her release."
The professor of North West University and an Oxford University staffer is looking for a homicide charge.
According to the police, there is a nationwide raid on a professor of North West University and a staff member of Oxford University, who are wanted as suspects because a riot of death was found in Chicago's luxury room.
According to the Cook County Court records, orders were issued Monday for the purpose of premeditated murder without the right to be released on bail of 40-year-old Windem Latham and 50-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, 20-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after he was subjected to multiple stab wounds.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was found on 27 July.
The police received a call, they arrived at the Grand Plaza suite and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
According to officials, Cornell Duranlo was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and now the detectives are investigating death from knife wounds, considering her murder, while the police are actively investigating two suspects.
Latham has been an adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at the North West University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbaj, Vice President of the University for Communications, reported in an e-mail statement that Latham was on administrative leave and was not allowed to enter campuses of the North West University.
“Now this is a criminal case that is being investigated by authorized persons, and North West University is cooperating with the investigation,” said Kabadj.
Warren is a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
The representative of the University and Somerville College reported in an e-mail statement: “We have communicated with the British police and are ready to provide all necessary assistance to the U.S. investigating authorities”.
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to surrender.
Chicago Police Chief Anthony Gulelmi said he strongly advised suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have assumptions about their whereabouts, but our efforts to find them are increasing,” Gulelmi said.
According to Gulelmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
According to Gulelmi, the police administrator of the Grand Plaza building has just received a secret message that something has happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene a terrible one.
Gulelmi reported that it was not clear whether the incident had taken place on 27 July.
According to him, the cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim have been linked to each other,” Gulelmi said.
Grand Plaza issued a petition to the tenants saying: “At present, the police are working on the chronology of the incident, gathering information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including possible domestic accidents”.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: “We will meet the requirements of the road map of AVADA in the near future”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) established to resume the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be met soon.
“A certain stage of compliance has been undertaken, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and run tests together with UKAD (the British Anti-Doping Agency).
The road map of AVADA was updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the road map of AVADA to restore the conformity status of the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of the work of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization ' s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could present difficulties for Russia.
“All has been announced, all will be accomplished.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and AVADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the requirements on the list implies that the Russian and doping structures should publicly recognize the results of an investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who claimed that doping in Russian sport was controlled by the State.
With regard to this issue, Mutko said: "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no self-programmes, and we won't admit what wasn't there."
Mutko reiterated Vitalia Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
On the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition Rsport Smirnov, he acknowledged previous problems in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain contentious positions and provisions.
There is absolutely no one to accept this report," Smirnov added.
AVADA removed RUSADA from the doping controls in November 2015 following the doping scandal.
However, in June this year he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the Moscow office of the organization in July, Director-General VADA Olive Niggli said that RUSADA was “moving in the right direction” to restore its work.
Exhausted fire in 79th tower in Dubai
A major fire that occurred in one of the world's tallest residential buildings, the Tower of The Torch, is passed on to Reuters.
It is noted that firefighters have managed to cope with all the burns by 4.00 local time (3.00 msk).
Local authorities reported that no one was injured as a result of the incident.
At the time of the fire, nearby skyscrapers were blocked.
The reasons for this are not yet known.
Previously, it was reported that the 79th - story skyscraper The Torch, one of the tallest buildings in the world, is on fire in Dubai.
All the lodgers were evacuated on time.
The Unimaginable Fist of the Worshiper's Fist: Underpants
Olga Buzov's scandalous show-leading show has struck Europa Plus Live with the rabbits.
In front of thousands of worshipers, a newly discovered singer with a duet with Nastya Kudra performed a song called "We Will Be Hot".
Both girls were on stage in provocative "breaths" sewn up in such a way that their underwear appeared to be singers.
The inscriptions of Buzova and Kudry were made on the pants.
Previously, it was reported that a specialist in a Moscow plastic surgery clinic had commented on changes in the appearance of Buzzovov.
Stoltenberg acknowledges the deterioration of NATO-Russia relations
This was reported by Radio 4 News Service on Friday, 4 August, with reference to foreign media.
According to him, it is the Russian authorities who are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In a CNN interview, NATO also criticised Russia for the Crimea situation and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine”.
However, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia was possible, but that further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that relations between the United States and Russia were at a dangerous low level, accusing the US Congress of this.
The Ekaterinburg Metro is gaining a new way of paying
In October, a visit to the Ekaterinburg metropolis would be possible to pay for a bank ticket, according to OAO Director "I-Network" Pavel Vedernikov in an interview with "The District Gazette".
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 World Cup the same system of subway fares as in other major cities: Moscow, St Petersburg, Lower Novgorod and Novosibirske.
“We want the sick from other countries, the guests of the Ministry, to take advantage of the metropolis with their bank cards, without acquiring tokens or standing in line,” he said.
The startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction of her e-commerce startup staff, but the interviews did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, untruthful.
Even though she promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust the process.
“He was never consistent and objective,” said Errett, head of a 75-person San Francisco company, Madison Reed, engaged in electronic hair care.
She therefore sought help from others.
A new type of staff start-ups is now emerging to help companies find out how their staff are feeling.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure staff involvement, they enable companies to conduct express interviews, to approach certain teams and demographic groups, to offer staff with anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases to enable informers to pass the top management and to direct their direction.
“Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Glint startup from Redwood City, whose analytical programmes are used by companies to measure staff involvement.
Errett explained that she had gained a better understanding of what her staff thought and felt in three years of Glint's use.
In addition to express requests and questionnaires of certain commands, the product offers a thermal map of the company and shows in a visual form which has more complaints and which managers have low ratings, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are well aware that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become the next Uber, who was involved in the scandal when a former employee published a blog post describing the violent situation in which those who expressed discontent were punished.
For startups like Glint, this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for a profitable business.
The Internet portal “Let’s talk about payment”, devoted to financial technology, the global governance, regulation and compliance industry by 2020, could cost more than $118.7 billion.
The Konvercent startup from Denver, Colorado, helping companies to prevent and detect bad behaviour, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year against Uber’s reputation.
The Convergence has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber appeared among the clients.
Like Glint, Konvercent allows companies to conduct individual staff opinion interviews, collect confidential real-time responses and view the thermal maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that enables staff to report misconduct.
And if they touch the top manager, the complaints go straight to the director's office.
“The public opinion court has taken over the authority of the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convergence.
If it turns out that the company is mistreated or unethical, even if the inspector does not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of boycotts by clients, staff outflows and lawsuits, Quinlan reported.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants where more than 25,000 employees work in 500 establishments, has been using "Convercent" for over a year to make sure that staff are familiar with the rules and procedures, and to offer a simple way of turning to the company's principal office.
Earlier, if the staff member wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look for a phone number or an e-mail from the head office, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and awkward experience, reported James Vitrano, head of the legal office of Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track staff complaints.
Now that the company is using the Konvercent service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states — such as discrimination, extortion and unfair pay — can be found and dealt with more quickly.
“I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of staff”, said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
“And we protect our shareholders from court proceedings against staff.”
According to Quinland, companies began to take the ethics, values and involvement of employees more seriously in 2002, after Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, suffered a breakdown due to ethical violations as a result of the Enron Business.
But only when social networks were widely disseminated, companies realized they could not keep their dirty underwear from viral proliferation.
“Before using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Konvercent offer their software as a service, which is regularly paid by companies for their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that has been approved by venture investors who have supported both startups.
In February, Konvercent received $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, resulting in a total of $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interrelated nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
The growing scope of research shows that today ' s staff expect more jobs than before.
In competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is just a minimum.
Staff want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are devoting their time to a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in companies, they feel that they are heard and that the work they are doing results, they are more likely to make such a company successful,” says Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Convergence and Glint are used.
Investors receive income when business from their portfolio goes well; companies do well when employees are loyal and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase the dedication and involvement of staff, it is not surprising that they find support.
It is important to have data on the involvement of staff, according to cultural professionals in the workplace.
But the data is useless until the company's guardians take action.
In fact, if the company asks for feedback, it may give the impression that change is coming.
And if change does not take place quickly enough, or if it does not come at all, disappointment may develop, and staff members will lose interest.
“If you are going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you must be prepared to hold 4,000 interviews,” said Russell Rat, president of the management consulting firm Kotter International, who had to see companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
'Why, if you do not go to the end, the staff will say, 'Did you really hear me?
You don't care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly staff interviews, is able to take action on the same day as someone reporting the problem through Glint.
And after collecting feedback from staff who were unhappy with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is getting new knowledge about its staff and hopes that in the long run, this knowledge will help it to better retain staff in a sector known for its high turnover.
"If you are not trying to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose clients, you lose companies.
In Barnaul, a new asphalt on the avenue of the Krasnoarmey
In Barnaul, fundamental measures have been taken to address the causes of asphalt failures on the Red-Armei prospectus.
The place where the holes on the recently falsified carriageway (the intersection with Youth Street) were twice established is determined to “open up”.
Remember, the destruction of a small section of the road near the tramways was due to the fact that the land was squandered in an area of unexploited unexploited network.
According to the Deputy Chairman of the City Committee on Road Management, Management, Transport and Communications, Ivan Garmat will conduct a detailed survey to address the risk of destruction.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that it will be necessary to rehabilitate and regenerate the exploitation of wireless communications.
This is reported on the official site of the capital.
Bruins has to work longer because the National Student Sports Association has cancelled training twice a day.
Time is approaching eleven o'clock; a crowd of football players from the University of California, Los Angeles, are delayed to talk on one side of the new training field of the campus team.
Some of them pulled off their T-shirts, exposing their backs glowing from the sweat after the tense first day of the sports camp.
For many players, these minutes of idleness are a break in the middle of the day.
Players enrolled in summer classes will return to their dorms after three hours of training to prepare for final exams and return to Vasserman Football Centre the next morning for meetings at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned Tuesday, team coach Bruins Jim Mora said, "In the next three days these guys will have meatballs."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the workload of the players, has actually prolonged their working day, at least until Friday's exams are finished.
So the first three training sessions of the California University team in Los Angeles were scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to be placed in a dense schedule of players.
A side effect of the absence of two training sessions a day has become more days with one training, and Bruins is launching a camp almost a week from last year and conducting training during summer school for the first time in six seasons of the Sea in Westland.
According to the schedule, they will have to conduct 18 training sessions by 20 August inclusive, before starting formal preparations for the first game in the season against the team of the University of Texas A&M in September.
He must have said that he supported the change of rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that there was another point in the players' schedule.
“In three or four days we give them this enormous burden, this is a serious test,” said Mora.
"And they just beat him, they work, they're great guys.
I think that when we live until Saturday and have more time, it will be really great.”
When the camp ends, the University of California in Los Angeles will make the training closed; this is a challenging task, since its fields are directly visible from adjacent parking and from the nearby Laskin Centre, a dear hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs that have crossed the firewall behind the gates.
The Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but he must allow that when rooms are available during the season, a problem may arise.
“We will have security”, said Maura.
“It’s a serious problem, and I’m not exaggerating the danger of anyone taking the room off, sitting there and recording the training on video.
If you have video training, it's very serious.
But we'll have security out there, and there'll be security guard at number eight.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan.”
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg have been discharged from hospitals
All the victims of the St. Petersburg subway attack in April were discharged from hospitals.
Deputy Governor Anna Mitjanina was informed about this in the press service.
According to data at the end of July, there were three people left in the stations, the TV Centre.
Remember, the explosion in the St. Petersburg metropolis took place on 3 April of this year.
A suicide bomber, Akbarjon Jalilov, blew up the bomb.
The attack killed 15 people, as well as the perpetrator.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer, Abro Azimov, were arrested.
To recall, Rosquibnadzor recommended that the Petersburg Metro Committee review the transport security plan, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors ' framework.
Facebook adds to the fact-checking in the fight against fairy-tale news
Facebook will more often send texts suspected of mystifications, independent experts, and present their findings under original posts, the world's largest social network, which attempts to fight the so-called Faik news, said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to identify possible mystifications, to send them for verification and possibly to show the facts of the checkup under the reference post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways of spreading so-called fairy tale news, which is widely believed to have had an impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.
This issue is also actively debated in Europe after French voters have been misled by false communications before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany, prior to the September elections, they have expressed support for the plan to fine social networks if they do not quickly remove hate fasts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook reported testing the new fact-checking algorithm launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing which reports are challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context in order to make informed judgements about what they read and what they share”, wrote the Facebook news feed manager in her block, Sarah Sue.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of “linked articles” and work on other changes in the news feed to address the issue of faikke news.
Create a comic book: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Scottnie's tiny castle was filmed in a music video called Squeez, and in the 1970s and 1980s, it served as a port for Margaret Tetcher.
But 700 years from his cosy spot in the Beul Valley in Kent County, he watched a turbulent history around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with land hair and a tendency to historical documents, to a comic book.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says enthusiastically.
"You feel it so personal when you hold this letter in your hand."
The castle in England covers a period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and describes the families that lived in Scotland; each history was illustrated by a young British artist, Eizek Lenkevich, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "The Dead Man's Teeth and Other Stories" -- a collection of British Library documents -- the project suddenly touched him to the depths of his soul.
"I could have been distracted by a simple fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites," he says.
"It's his finger print."
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those days, the lights were on.
And 300 years later, in the future, you think you're there, too.
Oh, I love archives!"
For a man with such passion for old papers, receiving support from the National Fund and the English Arts Council and living in a castle for four months (“I'm honest, I'm a little busy there”) seems too good to be true.
Rodes studied the “new” Victorian castle for days, went through the archives, and examined many treasures of wealth and old things - such as the heads of gins on walls or bottles, centuries in the trenches.
He went to the park and to the ruins of the old castle, talked to the foresters, gardeners, and sometimes to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then at night he drank whiskey and sat down to write.
The history of the Scotty Castle is not very studied, because the National Fund was only fully accessible in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassi, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff had only begun to deal with the archive, which he described as "that the aristocrats had been down for centuries."
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned them: "You think land disputes are boring, says Rhodes, but there were two families fighting on the beach.
That's what happens, guys."
In some stories, the castle collection has become a starting point for more extensive research in English history: for example, in Robotnik, the hero is leaving the newly built castle to join the 1381 Krestian Revolution.
“There is evidence of a rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called the “Rician families of Kent and Sassex”,” says Rhodes.
"The Christian rebellion began in these places, and I thought rebellion was a proper beginning.
Or were they bound?"
Other plots are closely related to the history of the castle, such as the “Holy Priest”, in which the Jesuit priest, whose family had been hiding for seven years at the time of the English Reformation, was described.
Or "Contrabandist," of the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral, stoned his grave (it was discovered years later when the grave was dug).
The Darrells are the beloved family of Rhodes, of all the people who inhabited Scottni, who said, "The gentlemen seemed to be a perfect hooligan, they were always in debt, and they were spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In various generations, Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy older women, and I think of them as a company of nice guys who can take care of the heirs of large states."
After finishing work at the Rodes Castle, there are other opportunities to gain unique written experience.
He lived for two weeks in Finnish deafness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elimaki, a place where in the early 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it grew again in the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like this: Damn it, I have to go back to real life again."
Fifteen largest banks choose Russia.
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: after Sberbank, WTB, WTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhosbank, Binbank and FC Open, seven other credit organizations are about to leave this public organization.
Thus, organizations leaving the ARB will account for at least 80 per cent of the market.
But it is not simply a solution - all the banks that have declared a gap with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that brings together credit institutions - the Russian Association of Regional Banks, led by a prominent politician, Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the Financial Market Committee, recognized, in part, as a result of the last session and the most effective leader of the Thought Committee and MP on the number of draft laws prepared.
The beginning of the conflict inside the ARB was placed during a debate in the Council of the Federation, when new bills were being considered by the Interregional Banking Council, in particular involving a new classification of banks according to the size of the statutory capital.
At that time, Garegin Tosunyan, President of the ARB, said that, according to the association, the bill was adopted for the benefit of the largest banks, which were thus trying to limit the capacity of small and medium banks in the regions by intercepting their clientele.
Other claims included criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, does not always justify the withdrawal of licences from some banks, which, in fact, was the result of an objection by the representative of the CB: many of the managers of the affected banks, in particular the Foreign Trade Bank, were members of the ARB governing bodies.
It appears that this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment and is a visible occasion for the fifteen largest banks, in disagreement with the ARB policy, to begin preparing for the association “Russia”, noting that “the effectiveness of the ARB’s work is low and that constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually being conducted”.
Players will be better
What's the end of this?
Let us answer the main question that arises in the event of a minor failure or a conflict in or near the banking sphere: investors are not in danger of anything, rather, of the reliability of the banking system.
Headed by “Russia” Anatoly Aksakov, known for his generosity in all matters relating to the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all the management of the CB is present at annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are carried out through expert assessments of “regionals”.
There are obviously no special shocks in the personnel and organization plan either.
Undoubtedly, the ARB finds itself in a difficult financial and management situation once such powerful and influential participants have been deprived of their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, this oldest, established in 1991 - an organization that defends the interests of the banking community - has considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the scope of monetary treatment in general.
It cannot be said that even in the Russia Association, with widespread pledges, new members are willing to accept on any condition, according to the reaction of its leader, Anatolia Aksakova ("may want too much"), who, on 21 July, at a press briefing at the Parliamentary newspaper, said that “literally the next day, the representatives of the ARB banks asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the potential of our association, Russia”.
Their proposals are to increase the vote of bankers on the Council of Association and to give more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is under way, the proposals of both parties are being examined, and the agenda for the extraordinary exit of the association to be held in Sochi in mid-September in an international banking forum is being prepared.
That's where we'll find out.
Anatoly Aksakov, underlining that “the chair is not held”, also called the possible new head of the updated association “Russia” Georgi Luntowski, who leaves the post of Vice-Chairman of the Centrebank in September, highly describing his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently resting in Crimea, plans to stop his vacation and arrive in Moscow for one day at an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Russian Association, where it is scheduled to consider the agenda of the extraordinary meeting of Russia.
The entry of petrol vehicles into Russia’s major cities will not be limited
Deputy head of Mintrans Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of petrol vehicles into Russia's major cities would not yet be limited.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually raise the environmental class.
And there's a concept that goes straight to zero emissions.
I don't think technically we're ready for this.
The question is, how long has it been?
It's the same word at the slogan level. Let's stop it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
The whole town's closed down?
"In 20 years -- I don't know -- maybe that's what's going to happen," brings out the Minister's "Prime."
Previously, the News reported that by 17 August, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorković had been entrusted with examining proposals for possible electric moderations submitted to the Government by Director of PAO KamAZ Sergey Cogogin.
Among the suggestions, according to the newspaper, are the use of vehicles with air force in large cities and in resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a Green Card.
According to the media, President Donald Trump said that a new United States immigration plan would be adopted that would change the rules for receiving a Greencard.
The plan includes reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for temporary working visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and are supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so in view of the change in the way the U.S. gives Greencards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new process of submitting applications will provide advantages to candidates who own English, have the money that allows them to keep themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said, according to the American media.
The appearance of sex robots is real, and that should bother us.
We failed to think that 2017 could no longer be worse, a new report on technological advances in sex robots has emerged.
Yeah.
Sex robots are at the centre of attention.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) recently issued a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharca, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must take their appearance seriously.
Users can choose the color of the robot’s eyes, the shape of the nipples, and the type of nails.
"People are giggling about this, but firms are already sending them to consumers, and we will see a lot more soon," Sharky said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable collectives into robots with silicone skin, warm to the senses, and with almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also “fit” their robots by their taste, choosing everything from eye color and form of robot sutures to shape and color of nails.
But the fact that many robots have a “person ” against which the Stepford Woman would appear to be very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robot enables users to adjust to the quality robots they find attractive, for example, subtlety.
There are other Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion, which are supplied with already programmed personality, such as the Cold Farra, which impresses the mysterious and the Dickia Wendy has a bold character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that looks great on yours," said True Companion.
That is why she loves what you love, does not love what you do not love, and so forth.
She's changing her mood throughout the day, just like a real man!
She may want to sleep or chat, or she may "be in the mood!"
There is a great deal of concern about sex robots, not least because they replace real human relationships, but the most disturbing of all is the subjugation of women, the association with rape, which leads to the control of the Cold Faro.
On the "True Companion" Roxxxy are compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality towards wanting sex with subjugation as an optional supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what has been brought to us from the periphery can be very instructive with regard to the meaning of the era in which we live.
And many people are not stupid or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It's not a coincidence that these complex sex robots appeared exactly when women's rights around the world were at risk when the White House had a president who boasted about what belonged to women.
The worst part in the TV series, "The Story of the Servant" is not graphic images, twisted bodies, and dissipated eyes, which is how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it does not seem that big.
The purpose of the sex robots industry is to achieve the physical likeness of real women (only with proportions of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to appear to be human to the senses to copy the movements of the human body.
But it's not exactly like real women with their "character" robots.
They can't break up with or walk away from their partners.
They don't have a life or a biography -- nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, they're beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, servants.
The native of Los Angeles Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, who has been in support of the collective Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which will start on 31 August.
In an interview with the BeBasket portal, the general manager, Andrey Lebedev, reported on this.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately he won't come under family circumstances.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized player, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
I recall that, with Jeter's direct involvement, the assembly Ukraine took a record sixth place in Eurobaskete-2013 and first hit the World Basketball Championship, where the yellow and blue were unable to overcome the group phase, while the U.S. national won an average of 15.4 points for the game, made 3 choices and gave 5 gears.
Jeter has ceased to advocate the assembly of Ukraine since its resignation as the head coach of our national team, the American Mike Fratello, who left the post in 2015.
Men's Eurobasket 2017 will take place simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold its team tournament matches on Earth.
Eugenia Murzin will have five individuals in group B: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparations for the tournament, our men's assembly conducted two control units, which gave way to Dutch and Belarusians.
The great feat of Trump?
Imagining Mit Romney seems very reasonable.
In the Trump era, it was common for political disputes that polarized the American electorate to break up some families at the micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the American newspapers watched column about how to deal with the terrible relatives who voted for Trump.
I think we're all so tense that we're about to pop.
Less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, the left-hand poet of Chicago, who had long been on the knives with Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that the alliance against the common enemy could have a strong impact.
At Tramp in the White House, everyone she knew, including the Republican brother she had debated over the policy of decades, suddenly and strangely, came to one side.
At dinner it's certainly good; but I can't help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump breathed power into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule can push us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we're going to stop seeing him.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the right-wing republicans, who will suddenly be shown a pattern of common sense against the background of his standards.
I realized that I was very bored today with Mitta Romney's old-fashioned madness - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 per cent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - compared to Trump and both seem like a very small evil.
When Trump's gone, the next Republican candidate will simply be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we took the kids to a carousel in Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best way in the city is to spend three dollars if you don't need coffee.
Flocks of grapes and giants, images of glasswolf on the central drum, dressing clowns and animals, which look at their backs in terror, are extremely creepy, and the sounding music, as strangely as it is, is a thrill.
So many well - known things in this city are disappointing: species from the skyscrapers are getting old, buildings are being taken too hard to shake, and the reality of the city is not successful after the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still going through the day that I learned that the Suiss-cotedge area is not really a Swiss scarf (thematic pub "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" is not an account), but a large cross in North London.
And a carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a child of two years, a child of eleven and two women of forty can have an excellent time.
If I could score a carousel, I'd make a five, but luckily no one asked me to.
And this week at the university, I was asked to do a terminal card, to evaluate my experience on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, the same thing, plus the option to make a 15 per cent tea assessment is for a standing order.
As a result, not only is interaction neutral, but there is also a need for a personal attitude in a situation that does not involve it.
The poor shopkeeper in the university smiled confusedly while I was getting tired of evaluating my credit card experience in five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital because of chest pain
Historic is leaving prison because of his visit to a doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of lacerations on his wrists, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of the fall in his cell.
The Pistius was convicted of intentional murder following the prosecution's appeal to the initial conviction for unintentional murder.
He killed Steencamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting at her several times through the bathroom door at his house in Pretoria.
Hispanic stated that he accepted his friend as a night thief hiding in his toilet.
The Prosecutor ' s Office stated that it intended to protest again, this time against the six-year term of Pretorias, which she said was too soft.
The Attorney General stated that he would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be considered this year.
The period of Pretorius may increase by 15 years if the prosecution succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
NTV Journalist Suspects Selected Non-Extreme Subscription
Capital law enforcement elected a measure of non-department signature for a man who attacked an NTV TV channel journalist, Nikita Razzjaev, during a direct air raid from Gorkog Park on 2 August.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the IMF, Irina Volk.
“As part of an investigation into a criminal case initiated under article 116 of the Criminal Code (“Trafficking”) against a 32-year-old man who hit a correspondent in a television channel in the Central Park of Culture and rest of the name of Gorki, the suspect was selected to stop in the form of a signature of non-department and proper conduct”, Volk clarified.
A representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol on police non-compliance had been drawn up for the suspect.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during the direct airing to the DVD Day, a sober man approached the correspondent and struck on the face.
As it turned out, the hooligan had nothing to do with VAT.
On the contrary, according to Razdżyev himself, the paratroopers tried to detain Moscow.
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to the BBC, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking, according to a report from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people were detained in Sitonia who placed tents in an uninhabited place, including two Bulgarian citizens.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the BBC that Bulgarians were then released.
The Greek authorities have strengthened the control of free camping and have already imposed serious fines on all those who have been caught during parking in an unspecified place.
Checks will take place throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Russia's MID accused US Vice President of the rhetoric of cold war.
Statements made during the US Vice-President Michael Pens' European tour have been criticized by the Russian MIDA.
“Unfortunately, Washington is increasingly heading towards primitive ideologies of cold war times, which are completely alienated from reality,” the Russian foreign policy agency said in a statement.
This was the response of the ILO to Pensa’s words about the Russian threat and attempts to forcefully cross the borders that he had spoken to him in Podgorica.
The Russian MID pointed out the destructiveness of the choice “or with the West, or with Russia” and the uncertainty of the alleged non-alternative entry of the entire South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to dissuade Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another source of tension.
“We call upon the American colleagues to put an end to Russia's isolation and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and willingness to work together constructively, in mutual interest”, said the Russian MIDA statement.
Feldsher was injured in a car accident with a short in Podmoskovie.
The accident took place in Stopingo, as a result of a foreigner's collision with the Quick Help carriage, affected Feldsher.
Today, around 08.10 msk was hit by a Mitsubishi ambulance in the town of Stupino Moscow.
“As a result of the collision of the fast vehicle,” TASS said in the press service of the Ministry of Public Health in Moscow.
There are law enforcement officers at the scene, and the circumstances of the incident are clarified.
In Odessa province, a woman threw her newborn son into a cellophane package.
On the evening of 3 August, the Police Department was informed by a local resident that it had found a package with a baby in an undesigned private house.
“At the scene of the incident, law enforcement officers and doctors who rushed the child to a medical facility” reported the Odessa chapter of the National Police.
The doctors determined that the boy was born hours before he was found, as evidenced by the presence of the umbilical cord.
Priority operational and investigative activities identified the birth of a 36-year-old resident.
It has also been found that a woman has three children.
As noted in the chapter, the family had not been in the field of law enforcement before and had not been given special consideration.
The circumstances and reasons offered to the woman in question by the police are currently being established, followed by a procedural decision.
The baby is now under medical supervision.
In Nikolayev, a 21-year-old woman was reported to have thrown her undernourished child into a garbage disposal.
Gregory Lepps: "I'm fighting, but 55 is not 30."
One of the most successful artists of the Russian Estrada Grigory Leps will celebrate his 55th anniversary on the coming Sunday.
Before the ceremony, the singer communicated with the observer of the News.
I remember what your "polite" said.
Special Tent in Lovers, Gloria Gainor sang for the noun, a powerful salutation over the Moscow River.
You must have been pretending to spend your next five years.
Are the plans coming together?
Speaking of profession, it was a good time.
I worked hard, went through the country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two good albums.
Of course, now I'm not what we say 20 years ago.
You can't fool biological clocks.
Singing the way I sang in my 30s is getting harder.
Still, I'm fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
You're writing a new album with them, the first one in three years.
Yeah, he's working on it now.
In fact, we've already recorded it in my studio and now we're sending it to the Los Angeles newsroom.
It's called "What's so serious?" in a song with Timati.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't been putting her anywhere.
We'll do it later when we get the video on it.
And the album will be presented in November by a series of my anniversary concerts at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow.
Chris Coleman, a good American drummer, attached his hand to your new plate.
Do you think you wanted to bring him into your gastronomic composition?
I think Coleman is one of the world's most outstanding drummers today.
He came to my studio, wrote down his parties.
I asked him to join my group, and Jeremy Coulson (a famous drummer involved in various projects).
But for long-term work in Russia, they put up excessive conditions, to say the least.
It was fees from €35,000 to €45 thousand per month.
Then I thought I'd find decent musicians in post-Soviet space.
And he found Max Malishev's brilliant drummer.
It is best to feed your own.
In time, I want to fight with one of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly regarded at the international level.
It is written by Western music magazines and is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wei, after listening to his play, said that "a new generation of guitarists came, with other performers."
Your album is coming to Los Angeles, and American musicians are cooperating with you, but you still can't come to the United States alone?
Are you trying to lift that ban?
Now, honestly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I'm truly sorry I can't go to America.
I've told you I'm in school.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful.
We're not dumber than they are, but we don't have that kind of experience, schools.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years have not been faced with the tasks that American musicians have always done.
They sought to make the most of the quality of sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has denied me entry for ten years.
But I'm still going to apply for a visa to the British Embassy every year to allow me to go there again, and most of all, to work there.
The rest of Europe favors me.
And already in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not an order, but an affidavit, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sporting Hall in Monte Carlo. I've been there before.
Now we've been invited again, and as far as I know, all the tickets to the concert are being sold out.
The Laima Wykule Randeva, which will start on July 20th in Jurmala, will you go?
She invited me, and I replied, of course.
Lyma is a wonderful singer and a wonderful woman who can make herself beautiful and even whisper.
After the gastrolls and the jubilee concerts, as far as I know, you want to go to Vladimir High's work once.
You've already got two albums with his songs on your record.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But he'll be completely different.
I want to write about 80-90 songs of the Highman on the same feed as he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangement.
I'll be joining our famous musician, Timur Vedernikov.
I'll try to get you to participate in the album and Alexander Yakovlewich Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about it, we had a good relationship, but he's busy, so let's see what happens.
You and the songs Boris Grebenczyk introduced gradually into your repertoire.
Why don't you record his album later?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a wonderful musician.
I had a couple of times with him, and I was like, "Can I sing one of his songs?"
He said: Grigori, I write songs that they may be fulfilled.
Please try, sing.
I think it's interesting to record an album like that.
As long as I don't have a problem like this, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn't object, I might make a project like this.
If you don't focus entirely on your production center.
I suppose until you've realized his potential, you haven't signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I'd like to have under my wing, but they're independent people.
You mean Sergei Lazarus?
The Sergeant is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he's got his own development strategy.
And now, in my center, there's Alexander Panayotov, who I used to run at the Voice.
We made a contract with him and we work.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be a sincere regret if he does not reach the heights of which he is worthy.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire. I'm taking the clips off.
I hope it's a good result.
I'm also trying to move other artists in my center: I buy them songs, I cry to poets, sometimes their tracks get turned into tele- and radio-channel rotations.
If they do not reach high altitudes, I will still lead our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On the way out, they'll get a recorded album, a couple of clips.
Then, if they so desire, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money they have invested in them.
Although I would be happy if one of them would make a commercial success and pay me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to recharge the oxygen.
Let everyone work, break through, prove how I once proved it.
If you're offered a tour of the country tomorrow and you're guaranteed entry, will you go?
I'm still being invited there.
These activities are mostly closed.
As for the big round...
I am a man of my country, a Russian man, who, in his own conviction, flew to Syria on the same plane that crashed.
If they say tomorrow that we have to go somewhere else for the benefit of the State, I'll take off.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I sincerely regret that we have had this situation with Ukraine.
Because I believe that we are one people and must be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen at least in the near future.
I used to give 40 to 50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
They met nowhere.
A very grateful audience.
And with several Ukrainian artists, he worked with Annie Lorak, St. Loboda, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, the mass of gifted people, and it is a sincere regret that they are unable to fully weave their talent into the vast Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I would be happy to invite some cool Ukrainian performer to Russia, such as the Glory of Vakarchuk, and have a concert with him.
But at this point, I think it's unlikely...
Andrea Ochlopkova was transferred from the launch site.
As was known, East Andrey Ohlopkov, Technical Director of the Space and Science and Production Centre, Hrunicheva, began work at the State Space Science and Production Centre.
He had previously worked in the construction of the Eastern Spacedrome, but because of his disagreement with the management of the Centre for the Exploitation of Land and Space Infrastructure (CENCI), he had been transferred to an enterprise in Moscow Philies, where he would coordinate production.
Mr. Ohlopkova will not have a shifter: the position of the Technical Director is likely to be abolished and the function is dispersed by CENCI units.
That the Technical Director of East and Deputy Director of CENCI Technology Development, Andrei Ohlopkov, had moved to work at the Hrunicheva GCNP, the U-top managers of several space industries, and the Government apparatus.
"He's been working on a new post for weeks," the "U" interlocutors in the industry clarified.
It was not possible to get an operative comment from CENCI on Thursday, and Mr. Ohlopkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the information “U” was officially confirmed in the GCNPC.
He decided to move to the post of Director for Production Coordination, said at the enterprise. - Andrey Ohlopkov completed his mission to ensure that the starting minimum for the first launch at the Eastern Spaceway was fully implemented.
Mr. Ohlopkov went to work at CENCI in 2013 with a service in the space forces, in particular in Baikonura, and in Plesetsek in the North Spaceway held the position of the first deputy commander in the colonel's name.
In 2009, Andrei Ohlopkov became a figure in criminal matters.
The investigation accused him of bribery: it was alleged that regional merchants had received from the massacres, but had failed to fulfil their obligations to clean up separate parts of the carriers in the Archangelic area and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury court found him innocent.
Its technological development responsibilities have been extended to various projects at CENCI, but the main ones have been the construction of a space corridor in the Far East.
The head of the then Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenko, in his interview "U", said explicitly that the situation in the East "was already critical in October 2013".
The fact is that a strategic error was made during the planning: completion of the construction and implementation of the first launch of the Union 2.1 launch was planned at the same time as the end of 2015.
In order to launch before the end of the year, the construction was completed six months earlier and was postponed from December to July 2015.
In order to accelerate the process, it had to be clever: CENCI began to operate parallel installation of technological equipment at undesigned facilities.
Andrey Ohlopkov was the main supporter of this idea.
Despite the risks and still the transfer (instead of December 2015, the Union only flew away on 28 April 2016), this idea justified itself, says source "U" at the launch site: "Unless we would have made any launch from the East, we would have done construction so far".
Vice Prime Minister Dmitri Rogozin, who was responsible for the creation of the cosmodum, joked that Andrea Ohlopkov called his "space Susanin", but he almost always asked for information on the progress of the building.
Remember Mr. Ohlopkov and directness: for example, in the interview "U" he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetzstrew) of the sole executive status in East and directly work with subcontractors: "Why should we store all eggs in one basket of Specstroy?"
This idea was supported by the Government.
Since 2017, CENCI has assumed the responsibility of the contractor-general to complete construction work on the start-up and technical complex by the fourth quarter.
According to the U, the reason for Mr. Ohlopkov's transition to a new place of work was disagreement with the CENCI management on how to complete the construction of the structures and complexes of the cosmodor, as well as working methods with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be better for all," said one of the top managers involved in the East.
The Government staff member, in turn, calls the decision a strange one: “He was one of the best professionals, finding an equivalent replacement would be difficult.”
According to the U, this will not be necessary: the post of the Technical Director of the Spaceway will be abolished and its functions will be broken down by CENCI units.
There will be a two-course programme in music schools
In the future, children's music schools will be able to receive two courses at the same time.
According to the vice-president of the Ministry of Science and Education of Svetoslav Golubenko, it is possible to re-read recurrent disciplines for students, and the question of paying for the other courses in the second field is addressed by special grants, according to RIA Novosti.
“The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this issue, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow two specialities to be achieved, but will not contravene existing education legislation,” said Dolubenko.
On the last Friday, during the "Nedetal Talk", Vladimir Putin, with the children's children's centre, Sirius, said that she had to pay for the recurrent courses in the second class at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me she was studying violin and piano, and she had competition awards on both sides.
The Head of State recognized its issue as a matter of great importance and promised to help.
In Mexico detained 17-year-old Russian on the skyscraper wall
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian Kiril N., who set foot on the roof of a tall building, is detained by El Universal.
An incident occurred in the capital city of Mexico City.
A young man, using two unknown men, crossed a three-meter drive to Nestle’s office building complex and went to one of his towers.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance or rope.
The young man was already detained on the roof.
The Ministry of Public Security staff dropped him on the ground on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute for Migration.
They found out whether a young man was lawfully present in the country.
In the meantime, the video with the young man at the height became popular in the Web.
The users called the young spider man.
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help to facilitate the KPC.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help relieve the symptoms of those suffering from inflammatory diseases in the gut.
This incurable disease, which affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, leads to stakes and blows of life, chronic or bloody pride, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, but researchers at Washington University have found that the primary amino acid of tryptphan protein contributes to the production of immune cells that increase oxygen tolerance.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells in the intestine are keeping the harmful germs from entering the body.
Cells capable of starting the inflammatory process are balanced by cages that increase tolerance, protect the body, without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance is excessively impaired to the side of inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory diseases in the gut.
Experiments have shown that mice with certain bacteria in their intestines have increased cell tolerance.
And this bacteria needs tryptophan, one of the building blocks of the protein, to start the emergence of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one species of bacteria, Lactobacillus reutera, which is part of the normal germ of the gut, and the development of the population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan was contained in the diet of the mice, the more those immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same would work for people: the combination of L. Reutera and a rich triptophane diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less prone environment in the gut.
Dr. Louisa Cervantes-Barraghanvas, studying the variety of immune cell tolerances, found that one group of test mice had these cells, and another group that belonged to the same line, but was kept separately, did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the microbiomas of the intestines of mice, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the gut and gut tract.
The DNA of the intestinal cells of the mice has been sequenced and six types of bacteria present in mice with immune cells but not in mice without them have been detected.
The mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have good microbioms and that did not develop this type of immune cell were L. Reuters, and the immune cells appeared to them.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. Reuters in a liquid environment and then carried small portions of fluids, without bacteria, to undeveloped immune cells separated from mice.
Immun cells have become more tolerant cells.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it was a by-product of the reprocessing of tryptophan, known as indol 3-moleic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the tryptophan level was halved, the number of cells dropped twice.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people have the same tolerance for cells as mice, and most of us have L. Reutera in their gastric-testinal tract.
It is not known whether triptphane by-products from L. reutera produce cells in humans as well as in mice, but in people suffering from inflammatory diseases in the gut, defects have been detected in genes associated with tryptophan.
She said, "It is possible that the development of these cells should be intensified, as these cells depend on inflamed processes on the inner surface of the intestines.
High levels of tryptphan with L. Reuters may potentially lead to an increase in their population.”
According to José Maureen, Manchester United hired a genius in the face of Nemanya Matić
Manchester United hired "genia" in the face of Nemanja Matić, according to José Mourien after the half-protector debuted in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The game of 40 million pounds at Chelsea began with a 2-1 victory in Dublin in the last pre-season match of United in front of the Supercup UEFA against Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression on the role of a half-protector, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereyra broke through in front of them.
However, since Matić did not participate in the pre-season tour of Chelsea for Asia, he was seriously lacking in preparations for the game, and he lasted only 45 minutes, which, according to Maureen, required further development before the opening season of the League.
“He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in what he thinks he thinks is football,” said Maureen.
“We will help him to prepare sooner rather than later.”
Like Matić, his playmates Victor Lindeloff and Romela Lukak began playing at the Aviva Stadium when Maureen began to form his main composition by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Maureen wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire first.
“I thank the club for winning three out of four”, he added.
“I will rejoice even more if they reach me four out of four, but they have already done a great deal for me.”
Former leaders of the Social Democrats of Lithuania bid them to remain in the ruling coalition
Former Presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, ex-Prime Minister Algirdas Butkjawis and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former Speaker of the Seima of Social Democrats, Cheslavas Jurchenas, called on one party to remain in the ruling coalition.
As the Parliamentary Gazette reported, due to friction with partners - the Alliance of Farmers and Greens - a debate was initiated in the Social Democratic Party, whether a ruling coalition should remain in place.
Here are three senior experienced associates who have addressed the single party with an open letter stating, inter alia, that “understanding the party’s disillusionment with the results of the elections, the coalition with the “Christians” has created for us a very easy but still conditions for further implementation of the social justice goals that we have set out in the Government’s programme and for maintaining the political domination of the left centre over the right parties”.
According to former party leaders, “emotion-based expression has so far dominated the discussion without specific arguments”.
The authors of the letter fear that reckless action by their party can lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Antônio Mamaeva was fined.
Mosgorsud reduced the punishment of the wheelchairman Anton Mamaev from four and a half years ' imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 rubs.
Previously, a convicted person had been released from SISO by decision of the Timirazev Court.
However, Mosgorsud confirmed that the accused was a criminal because he organized the robbery and abduction of the biker from the former Special Forces fighter.
Mosgord reduced Anton Mamaev's sentence to 200,000 rubies.
“Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes the composition of the crime, and therefore must be criminally held”, explained “U” Press Secretary Mosgorsud Uljan Solopov.
In the present case, the court took into account the health condition of Mamaev, the factual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, which provided that the penalty could be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to Mamaev's assistant Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish the circumstances which would be the basis for a change in the category of gravity of the sentence in question and a change of sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that he remained dissatisfied with the decision of Mosgorsud.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be justification, the intention to continue fighting for justice.
His lawyer, Andrei Orlov, did not rule out an appeal in the cassation of Mosgorsud and the Supreme Court.
“We will use all the leverage up to the European Court of Human Rights”, he said, “RIA Novosti”.
Remember, the 28-year-old Moscowian Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscle atrophy, became a figure of criminal case in the fall of last year.
The invalid claims that he bought a motorroller from his acquaintances for 160,000 rubles to sell.
However, motoroller owners, including a former Special Forces fighter, claimed that the disabled person and his assistant, Vasily Seroshtanov, had stolen property from them, threatening to resort to violence.
On 30 June, the Timirazev Regional Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years of colony and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years ' imprisonment with sentences in the general regime (art. 162 of the Criminal Code).
After the disabled person was placed in SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Office of the Human Rights Commissioner for President Tatyana Moscalkov, joined the case.
As a result, Anton Mamaev was released from SIZO in mid-July by a decision of the same Timirazev court.
The defence, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in Mosgorsud.
ONF to prepare a report on ecology to the President
The Final "Forum of Action" of the Pan-Russian People's Front (ONF) will focus on environmental issues in 2017, reported to the UNF "News" source and confirmed the head of the Aleksimimov movement.
He said that following the “frontoics” forum, he planned to prepare a report to the President on national environmental issues and to propose a strategy to address them.
Reporters to the UNF note that the report of the Head of State will contain a “deep analysis” of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to the News, the final forum of the ONF will be held in autumn.
The exact date of the meeting is not yet defined - it is generally based on a presidential timetable, which is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present at key UNFF events.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts, in Rostov-na-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Buratiya Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been and will be made at these events, we will form systemic proposals to address environmental problems, said the “Investigation” interviewer at the UNFF.
The Co-Chair of Olga Timofeev, Head of the Committee of the State for Environment and Environment, reported that “frontuicians” would report to the Head of State on the work carried out during the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the UNF Forum for Action are likely to be combined.
Over the year, we abandoned a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, saw gaps in legislation, and stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be part of a report that we are preparing for the President as leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, “frontrunners” are reported on the work on the priority UNF projects,” said Olga Timofiev, “Notice”.
She said that Sergey Ivanov would also be invited to the forum by the Special Representative of the Head of State for Environmental Affairs, Environment and Transport.
He had previously participated in the ONF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
A few months from now, the Year of Ecology will go back to history, and the most important thing that needs to be done today is to start environmental mechanisms so that they can work for many years.
In order to prevent these issues from falling off the agenda, Olga Timofiev added.
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Social Research Expert Institute (EISI) Andrew Koladin noted: with environmental concerns, the ONF is operating on the Presidential agenda.
Many things, as experts, have been offered in various forums, and these initiatives have received the support of the President, said Andrey Koladin to the News.
He stressed that, to date, the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded, which could give the regions additional impetus for development.
Further, with the help of the ONF, regions will be able to lobby not only for their environmental problems, but also for the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The environmental theme has been demonstrated by the “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about the garbage dump in Balashia (already closed) and about the coal dust in the port of Nakhodka (a bill on the prohibition of open coal smuggling in settlements, one of the authors of Olga Timofeeva).
Ecology experts believe that the legal framework for addressing environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been established, is a matter of further enforcement, as well as of civil society.
A clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State is needed, according to the head of the Ecology for All charity fund Leonid Bochin.
The head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, Sergey Ciplenkov, in the conversation with the “Investments”, stressed that a responsible approach by society and business was not necessary to successfully address environmental problems.
As soon as society and business realize that addressing environmental problems is a much more beneficial step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change,” said Sergey Ciplenkov.
The expert stressed that it was necessary to reverse the trend that breaches of environmental legislation were a cost-effective solution for the business.
A British inventor used a microchip to get into a house and a car by the hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip set up so that he could open the door to his home, walk into his office, and even start a car with a simple sweep of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northham used a tiny chip between large and index fingertips, and now, through his company, BioTek, he offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives for technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from Queen's Winchester, to ensure that the intake procedure was conducted in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is like a microchip used by cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Nortem also replaces locks in houses and machines for compatible with a chip at a price of £300 per castle.
The married father of one child has already installed technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which is started when his hand is on the wheel.
A White House prop cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
According to the weapons records provided to TIME magazine, the White House decision last month to drive a helicopter of marine infantry to the South Lawn at an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, became a central element of the event held on 17 July in the White House, where American construction programmes were demonstrated.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pens and White House senior officials have examined technological products from all 50 states.
A helicopter produced in Connecticut was launched near a yacht from the state of Man, a fire vehicle from Wisconsin, and a truck from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Squadron of Marine Infantry helicopters (HMX-1), the helicopter control unit ordered the presence of a helicopter in private order, or “FRAGO”, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of an “unusual” event.
“I just wanted you to know that you were aware of this because it is an unusually widely publicized event in the press”, said HMX-1 in an e-mail to your chief, the first Deputy Chief of Air of Marine Corps, before the event.
The letter stated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on 17 July to participate in an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and would remain there before the lawn would be released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required to return in accordance with the restrictions on hours of service.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the operation and the security officers remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the recordings received by TIME, it was not clear whether a second crew was needed.
The Hetch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the action was contrary to that decision.
"We asked, among other things, whether this is a violation of the Hetch law, and we were told that it was not," the commander wrote.
“It seems you have nowhere to go,” answered the deputy chief.
The event “Made in America” was declared an official event by the White House and had not been covered by Hatcha law.
But even official activities have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to promote health reform, the former at the time in the Senate, and praised attempts to regulate government decisions.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is unlikely to be new.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But asking for them only in the interest of photography is unusual.
Trump was already the subject of a debate in February, when a presidential plane was out in the background during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was bugged by complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
“The White House was thrilled by the show “Made in America”, which represented products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” said White House Vice-Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington agglomeration and the South Lawn to train the transportation of the President of the United States to the White House with accuracy up to an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight carried out for the “Missing in America” event was estimated at the required training flights per month.
The unit helicopters also flew 11 additional hours that day as part of the “non-presidential support tasks”.
According to the White House, taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of Sikorsky reported that the company had not participated in the demonstration of the helicopter in the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent at the event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence’s 2017 fiscal rate, the rate of reimbursement of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight.
The records of the unit indicate that the time of the aircraft in the air was 30 minutes to each side of its airfield based on the Kuantico air base in Virginia.
The White House argues that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“To calculate the cost for taxpayers, based on an approximate rate of reimbursement, is quite wrong,” says Walters.
“These indicative rates include personnel, services and many other irreversible costs, which are included in the annual appropriation.”
According to a study carried out by the REND Corporation in 2015, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do indeed take into account the fuel, service and costs specified in the contract.
At that time, former White House Spokesperson Sean Spicer spoke in defense of the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to demonstrate this week the things that have been done in America,” said Spicer.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which has been worked tirelessly by so many Americans.
It is therefore, of course, appropriate to draw this attention.”
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter by inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he was definitely sitting in a driver's seat in a fire vehicle.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, making a press release on the subject of his own fleet of products of the company.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” said the president. “I have three.”
Moscow to allocate grants for city hospitals' rehabilitation offices
Every year, Lifesaver grants will be allocated to intensive hospital therapy and resuscitations.
Funds to encourage doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobjanin, visited the City Clinical Hospital named Juden.
During his examination of the clinic, he handed a thank-you letter to Dr. Traumatologist Victor Procco, who was led by the most complex juvenile reconstruction operation.
Sergey Sobjanin also described the decision to provide intensive care for city clinics annually.
Funds will be directed to the promotion of doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of the capital, the Jewish clinical hospital is one of the largest in Moscow to date.
Over the past few years, the clinic has received new modern equipment to enable its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 at the base of the Colombian Rural Hospital.
More than a thousand patients are currently being treated by the health care services.
In addition to resuscitation and the station, there are day offices.
The hospital staff has 2,800 personnel.
The total area of medical care is 23.7 ha.
In February of this year, the medical institution participated in a pilot project on the organization of short-stayers (SCP).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
In the course of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used to significantly reduce the period of rehabilitation of patients.
After the operation, they only spend a few hours at the station.
During the first six months of this year alone, 36,000 patients were provided with permanent care at the Juden Clinical Hospital.
Medical staff at the clinic carried out 1,5800 operations of various degrees of complexity.
NBU reported the absence of Ukrainian daughter-in-law Sberbank
In Nazbank Ukraine (NBU), there were no applications for purchase of Ukrainian daughter Sberbanka.
On Friday, 4 August, TASS reported with reference to a representative of the NBU press service.
NBU confirms that, on 3 August 2017, a package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, Victor Prokopeni, was withdrawn to agree on the acquisition of 100 per cent of Sberbank shares (through Paritybank).
“No documents were received from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank shares in NBU”, the communication noted.
On 3 August, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenenia withdrew an application for the purchase of Sberbank's daughter structure.
On 28 July, it became known that Nazbank Ukraine had denied Russian businessmen Saidu Guteriev and Gregory Huselnikovov the acquisition of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision that businessmen did not provide the necessary documents to verify their compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation.
Sberbank reported on the sale of his Ukrainian “daughter” to Norvik Banka and to a private Belarusian company in March of this year.
Saeed Guteriev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guteriev, was the major shareholder of the consortium.
Sanctions against the docks of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were imposed in mid-March.
During the year, they are prohibited from withdrawing their capital in favour of their mother ' s organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the United Nations said.
Elections can only be representative when they are attended by all members of society, including women, the head of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the head of the United Nations mission to assist Afghanistan, hundreds of women compete for provincial council elections, three women fight for the post of Vice-President, and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in his statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Elections to the provincial councils and presidential elections will take place in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban threatens to disrupt the electoral process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from military operations to advisers.
In this year ' s elections, power is for the first time moving peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom stated that increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

In Venice, fines for tourists were tightened for misconduct
The Venetian authorities have increased the fines for bathing in canals from €50 to €500.
For walks around the city in a bathhouse or with a naked toe, they will now be fined 200 euros.
For 100 euros, TASS will refer to the Russian Association of Tourist Operators to those who will have a public picnic or ride a bicycle in pedestrian areas.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities impose a fine for inscriptions on euro 400 and euro 25 pieces of garbage.

The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the tourism adviser, Venice, Paola Mar, fines will be handed over to the embassies of the home countries in order to prevent their compatriots from making such mistakes.
“The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach”, she noted.
In April, the Italian city administration reported plans to limit the traffic.
There is already a successful restriction on the number of tourists visiting the city centre.
Instead of 100,000 people wishing to observe the Festa del Redentor festival, only 60,000 guests were admitted to the venue.
In addition, a moratorium was introduced on the establishment of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice.

SF released Ozerova as Head of the Committee
On Wednesday, the Council of the Federation supported the statement made by the Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, Viktor Ozerov, and released him.
He remains a senator from Khabarovsk Region.
A statement requesting his release from the post of Ozerov wrote last week.

Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers of Buratiya
The Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buratiya (Eastern Siberia) have been working for a decade to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers.
Electricity in low voltage for industrial recipients has decreased by 25 per cent since 1 September.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country, in accordance with the Government of the Republic of Russia Decree on the Amendment of the General Market in Electricity and Power and the Integrated Projective Balance of Electricity Production and Supply (power) within the framework of the Russian Single Energy System on the Entities of the Russian Federation (No. 84, 17.07.2017) established indicative electricity prices and capacity for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buratia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for drilling producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic have taken advantage of the thresholds of Moscow's cabinets in vain attempts to align the region in tariffs with the neighbouring Irkutsk region with a stunt of hydroelectric power plants in Angar flowing from Baikal, the main catchment area for which is Buryatia.
And only this year did the movement begin.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 rpm/kWh to 3.93 rpm/kWh, or 7.3 per cent.
The Federal Government ' s decision to include storms in the List of Areas of Price in the Whole Market Areas, which are characterised by the specificities of wholesale and retail markets, has resulted in a series of industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays for kilowatt/hour 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to name at least an approximate date for new tariff movements towards the decline for Stormy.
Scooter was not intimidated by Ukraine's Procuratorship and flew to Crimea
The legend of electronic dance music, the Scooter group, arrived in Crimea without fear of threats by the Attorney General of Ukraine.

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Casual Workers (GMB) is concerned about the capitalization at the McVitie's plant in Glasgo
The union requires assurances from the management of the McVitie's cookie manufacturer in connection with his long-term obligation to manufacture the Glasgo factory.
The Scottish GMB office reported that the company was silent on the future of investment at the Tokcross site.
More than 500 people work at the factory producing, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, reports that over the past few years she has invested more than 5 million pounds in the facility.
The company adds that, in the event of any change in the operation of the facility, the staff and the representatives of the trade union “will be the first to know about them”.
In a letter to the head of the company's facility, the GMB Scottish office demanded a response from McVitie's to the concern that funding would not be allowed to modernize production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Daffi stated: “Members of our union are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the Chief General of the facility on business needs and the investment plan for the future of Tolcross”.
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers has been great in local society and in the Great Glasgow territory; it is a crucial pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, from the point of view of jobs, wages and prosperity, and from the background of Brexit, the increase in living minimum and chronic decline in production, East End Glasgow desperately needs to flourish in production at McVitie's factory.
According to Pladis, “The head of the Tolkros facility only received a letter from the Scottish GMB office yesterday, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with the staff and representatives of the trade union”.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with staff members and representatives of GMB, at which a number of issues were discussed openly.
We have talked to the staff that, as all companies operating under the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions — and this concerns all our facilities and activities — in order to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tokcross facility, especially in production lines and improved functional indicators.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a productive facility, and in the event of any changes in the operation of the facility, the staff and the union will be the first to know.”
Putin stated that the authorities would not give orders to Rosnefti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of gas supplies to the East Petroleum Company (VNHC) should be joined by the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but the Gazpromu guidelines, as well as the Rosnefti, would not be given.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sekina's request to help resolve the conflicts.
The Head of State noted that the relationship between Rosneftu and Gazprom should be resolved solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, head “Rosnefti” Igor Séchin at a meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District said that the lack of agreement with Gazprom on gas for VHC jeopardized the duration of the project.
Sechin noted that dialogue with Gazprom was continuing on this issue.
Gazprom proposes to find gas resources from the Rosnefti perimeter, but we do not have such resources," added Cechin.
Let us recall that Rosnefti has requested permission to use gas from the Kirin place of Gazprom located on the Sakhalin shelf for the Eastern Petroleum Company.
Gazprom stated in June that negotiations on the issue were ongoing and “no sharp corners there”.
Did he warn the FGM of the crossing of Neumar three years ago?
A member of the La League may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Pari Saint-Jereman will not cease to pursue Neumar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record that hit three years ago?
The sensational proposal revived the summer transfer window when the League 1 club was ready to beat the world record at the cost of transition, more than twice exceeding the previous mark associated with the return of Pol Pogba to Manchester United in the last season of 89 million pounds.
When the transition is over, Najmar will be the world's most expensive player, as well as the world's most highly paid professional athlete, as the PJW offers him the salary of more than 500,000 pounds a week.
It is known that Barcelona and the rage of the proposal and how Najmar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as the source insists, close to the management of the Catalan club, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned about such a possibility three years ago by the President of PSC?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the recruitment of Blaise Matthews in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi gave a strong warning to any club that wishes to deceive one of the best players of the FGM.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we’ll go against them, we’ll make offers to their players," Al-Helaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
