Wales’s Assembly members worry that they “look like Muppets ”
Part of the members of the Assembly are ridiculed by their proposal to change their title to "CUP" (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal has been provoked by plans to change the name of the Assembly of Wells.
Members of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this may become a cause for ridicule.
One of the Labourers said that his group was concerned that the new name “is rhymed with Thump and Deep. ”
For readers outside Wells: In Welsh this is definitely offensive.
According to one of the Plaid party members, the whole group “is not happy” and has offered alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh conservative party pointed out that his group was "not prejudiced" to change the name, but noted that the new name of the VWP (in English – MWP) had a certain verbal occasion with a "moon".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similar to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Commission of the Assembly, which currently drafts the bill by which the name should be changed, made the following statement: “It is understood that the final decision on all descriptive names with which the members of the Assembly are called will belong to the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Wells Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public inquiry into the proposals, which established broad support for the Assembly to start calling it the "Parliament of Wales".
As far as the duties of its members are concerned, the Commission prefers "members of the Wells Parliament, in short, "CPP", but the option "CPP" has received the greatest support after the public has been questioned.
The members of the Assembly are offering alternative options, but reaching consensus will clearly be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft bill for the amendment within a few weeks.
The Reform Bill will include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including the rules on disqualification of its members, as well as the design of the Commission's system itself.
Members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they reach the debate on the bill.
Macedonians to vote in referendum whether to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum is planned to resolve the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, where it has an administrative area called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the change in the name of the state, said he would not read the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name of the state is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells shut up amid church difficulties in Harlem
"If we look from the historical plan, according to the old people I talked to there was a bar and a church literally on every corner," said Mr Adams.
"Today both have disappeared."
Adams says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today are socialising in different ways," he added.
"The bars are no longer the quarterly day-to-days where all meet regularly."
As for the churches, he expressed concern that the money from the sale of the assets would not reach as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they would be in the same situation”.
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks with apartments where people live who do not help survive the rest of the sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of the people who buy housing in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the new settlers will visit them."
Both churches were built by white pastures before Harlem became the Black Quarter – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin for a decade later.
The original white methodist flock moved out in the years after 1930.
Then the building became the possession of the black residents of the neighborhood.
"St. Martin" was taken by black Christians under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organised a fight against retailers on 125th Street, which is the main market street in Harlem, because they did not want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building suffered severe fire damage, but Father Johnson's enorias drew up a plan for its restoration, in which they ordered the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly calls them the "poor bells".
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: “Cultural Treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ngu of Michigan University, also noted that this was the first system of bells in the world that was used by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger system in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meryweather mentions that St. Martin never replaced him.
What took place at St. Martin's in the last few weeks has been a complex story woven by architects and performers, some brought in by the world leaders of the church, and others from the Episcopal diocese.
From the newspaper – which is the governing body of the congregation, consisting of world leaders – they wrote to the diocese in July, expressing their concerns that the diocese “would be inclined to transfer the expenses of the newspaper”, although it had no role in hiring architects and performers sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old child was injured by a shark fishing for lobsters in California
Shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while he was diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, the representative authorities said.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Ensenitas.
Chad Hummel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was snoring with friends about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and ran in with a group to get him out of the water.
Hummel first thought that the child had caught a lobster and was excited, and then he realized that he was screaming, “It bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel says that when he got to the boy, he realized that the whole area of his key had been torn apart.
"I called on everyone to come out of the water because there is a shark!" Haml adds.
The boy was transported by helicopter to San Diego Children's Hospital, where he was admitted to critical condition.
It is not yet known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
The savior Captain Larry Gilles gave a media briefing that a few weeks earlier a shark was spotted in the water, but it was estimated that it was not dangerous.
Jills adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his body.
The responsible authorities have closed access to the coastline from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Suomi in Enstitinas for 48 hours from safety considerations while the investigation is under way.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which are not dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury plans offensive on the British market for ornamental products
Sainsbury faces Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by opening stands for ornamental products in its facilities where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the UK beauty market, which is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds and continues to increase while the sales of fashion and household products decrease, the largest beauty stand will be located in 11 stores throughout the country, after which, with the success of the initiative, similar ones will be found in more sites.
The investment curve in the ornamental industry is made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the embankments, recently occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
From Sainsbury they said they would double the number of ornamental products offered to up to 3000 products, for the first time including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw.
Current product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space, similar to the offers in Boots' stores.
The supermarket also restarts its boutique gamma makeup so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought by younger users.
In addition, the perfume trader Fragance Shop will test discount programs in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Kroyden, South London last week, until the second will be opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and shifting focus on shopping for smaller quantities of food daily at convenient times leads to the fact that supermarkets need to make more efforts to attract buyers.
Mike Coop, Chief Executive Director of Sainsbury, said that objects would look more and more like universal stores while the supermarket chain is trying to cope with Aldi and Lidl discounters, offering more services and non-food goods.
From Sainsbury they have facilities in Argos in hundreds of stores, and they also open Habitats sites since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claims to have increased food sales and made the profits even more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to reshape its objects for ornamental and pharmaceutical products has failed.
Sainsbury made a joint effort with Boots in the early part of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's facilities in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business with 281 Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there they claim that Lloyds will have a role to play in the plan, providing a rich range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, made the following statement: “We have transformed the type and character of our beautiful stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We also invested in special training of our colleagues who will offer professional advice on the ground.
The range of brands offered by us is intended to respond to every taste and all necessary in one plenipotentiary with a comfortable location, and this combination makes us an attractive destination for ornamental products that challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughby's refusal to make a deal for 11 million pounds.
The star from Dragons Dan Peter Jones “has become furious” after the television-leading Holly Wilbbi gave up a 11 million-pound deal with his lifestyle company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Wilby doesn't have time for the brand of household appliances and accessories Truly.
The couple's business is compared to the Goop brand of Guinet Poltrow.
The 37-year-old leader of "This Morning" announced her resignation in Instagram.
Holly Wilbury left the star from Dragons Den Peter Jones "to boil" after withdrawing from their profitable business with the brand products for Lifestyle in the last minute – while focusing on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones “has become furious” when the “Golden Girl” on TV admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – mean that there will no longer be time for his brand of household products and accessories Truly.
The business is similar to Guinnet Poltrow's Goop brand, and the rumors are that he doubled Willoughby's wealth, whose value is projected at 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced in Instagram leaving Truly, Jones left Britain on a plane to go to one of his vacation properties.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s highest priority.
It was expected to be its long-term commitment to ensure its future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave boils down completely unprepared.
No one believed this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There's a warehouse at Marlowe headquarters that's full of waiting products to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leading UK star on this morning could cost the company millions due to the large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and could also lead to a slowdown in the marketing of the brand.
And last but not least, it may also mean the end of a long friendship.
Wilby, who is the mother of three children, along with her husband, Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willbury herself founded Truly together with Cap in 2016, as Jones, who was 52, joined as the company's president in March.
The two families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willubi will become the "m&S ambassador" of the brand and will also replace Anne McParlin as lead the broadcast "I am a celebrity" on ITV.
A source close to Jones last night made the following statement: "We will not comment on his business affairs."
Heavy negotiations leading to “continuation of relations”
He joked about the criticisms he would take from the news channels for commenting, which some would consider "unsuitable to the President" and being too positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in his own "joke" way.
"I haven't given up anything."
He noted that Kim showed interest in a second meeting after the first one was held in Singapore in June and was announced by Trump as "a major step towards the removal of North Korea's nuclear weapons".
But the negotiations to remove this weapon are stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Jung Ho told UN General Assembly representatives that North Korea “does not see a reciprocal attitude” by the United States towards the country's first steps on the path of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump presented a rather optimistic view of things in his speech.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful," he noted.
"We were headed for a war with this country.
Millions of people would have died.
Instead, we now enjoy a wonderful relationship."
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results – ending missile tests, releasing hostages and returning to the US military's bodies.
He also defended his non-orthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It is extremely easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to enter this crowded zone, we would have about 200 people right there," Trump said, pointing the crowd ahead.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate the island and lead to hundreds of deaths
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were declared unnecessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for initiating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it is clear that international aid is not required, which makes things slightly challenging," Mrs Sumbun said.
While "Save the children" is forming a team to head to Palu, it is still not certain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the territory of the country.
Mr Sutopo, the national spokesman for the disaster agency, announced that the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether to allow international agencies to contribute to the recovery efforts.
Taking into account the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this type of natural disasters.
Although shelters were built in Aceh in the event of tsunamis, they are not common on the other shores.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palo probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logistics even more difficult.
Until recently stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake, a hospital ship went to Palu, but it would be at least three days before he could reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Wiidodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's backward infrastructure the centre of his campaign, investing a great deal of funds in roads and railways.
But insufficient funds constantly harass his cabinet, while Joko is returning to the urns next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 were killed, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with swords, bows and arrows, as well as other original weapons.
Watch: Daniel Stridge brings late equality for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from losing the High League against Chelsea naked in the 89th minute this Saturday at the Stanford Bridge in London.
Stridge got a submission from Gerdan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door while his team was down by 1-0.
He set the ball on his left foot, then fired a precise shot at the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penalty field and directed towards the top right corner of the network.
She transferred the platter Kepa Arizabalaga and entwined herself unsavoryly into the net.
"I tried to take a good position to master the ball, because players like Shak always look for pitches in front positions, so I just made sure to win as much time as possible for a good shot at the door," Stridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the pushover Kante, I pushed my ball, and I just shot without much thought."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute after the goal of her Belgian star, One Azar.
The attacker of the "blue" filed with Mateo Kovacic's heel, then sprinted from the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
Kovacic exchanged fast double submission in the center.
Then he released a fast shot belt that led Azar to a clean position in the penal field.
Azar fled the defenders and scored with his left foot at the far corner of Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the group stage of the Championship League at 3 p.m. this Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be a videoton in the UEFA League of Europe at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of deaths following the earthquake and the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832, as the country's disaster agency reported early Sunday.
Many people are trapped among the ruins of buildings, collapsed after the 7.5 earthquake that struck the country on Friday and led to waves up to 20 feet high, the reporter of the news conference at Sutopo Purvo Nugroho reported.
The city of Palou, with more than 380,000 people, is surrounded by ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched since this morning at Burkenhead, Mercisseid's body was discovered by a woman.
The remains of a 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. in the morning with the wounds of Grayson Mousse's stabbing on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was suspected of committing the murder.
The police are asking for help from all the areas that have seen or heard nothing.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan made the following statement: “The investigation is still early, but I beg everyone who was near John Street in Burkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious, to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with the cameras on their board, to contact us as it is possible to have vital information for the investigation."
Police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a Burkenhead resident and was found in private property.
This afternoon, a group of friends who consider the woman to be their acquaintance arrived at the scene and inquire where she was found in the morning.
The investigation continues, as police report that the victim's relatives are currently being informed.
A taxi driver who lives on Grayson Mousse tried to get back to his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
The man was silent when he found out about what happened.
Residents have been informed that hours will pass until they are allowed to return.
One of the police officers reported to a man that the entire area was treated as a crime scene.
There was a woman crying.
She keeps saying "this is so terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans crossed the border while another van stayed outside.
There are officers in the border who are monitoring the housing block.
All available information is requested to contact @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, code 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue becomes the latest memorial hit by "rewriting history"
Its ban will be poetic justice for its almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by its fanatic Puritan followers.
Cromwell's Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "crazy" and "a rewriting of history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of Cromwell's Society, said: “It was inevitable in this debate that the statues of Oliver Cromwell to the Westminster Palace would be removed as a target.
The iconocracy of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornikroft is proof of 19th century opinion and part of historiography about a figure that many still consider to be worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is an exact presentation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable person who represents one side of the coming division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve marking and honor."
A killer pig injures a deadly Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man identified only by his family as Yuan was found dead with a cut-off artery and covered in blood near the cabin of Liupangshui's market in Guizhou Province, reported on Sunday South China Morning Post.
The pigwood prepared to inject its pigs with vaccines in Sinin of Qinghai Province, China, on 30 May 2005.
He is expected to arrive with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also opened the door to the next cabin open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig with a blood gulp in his leg.
Forensic expertise has confirmed that 550-pound pig attacked a deadly farmer, the report reports.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and deformed," said cousin Wu, quoted by Guyyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows how Juan goes on the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killer didn't belong to Juan or his cousin.
The market manager reported to the Evening News that the pig was locked up so he could not attack anyone else while the police were collecting evidence from the crime scene.
It is also reported that Juan's family and the market leadership are negotiating a death benefit.
Although rare, it has been reported that pigs that attack humans have been attacked before.
In 2016, a pig attacked her wife and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and after the attack, the man was severely injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig tied a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife chased him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood may be “a drop”.
"They're just playing.
Pigs are like little kids, extremely curious... they don't mean to hurt anyone.
But one should treat them with respect," the man ends up.
The weakening hurricane of Rosa will lead to frequent and torrential rains in the southwestern part of the United States
According to weather forecast, the hurricane, Rosa, is weakening as it moves over the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days Rosa will lead to flooding rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern parts of the United States.
Rose includes winds with a force of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane, which is at 5 o'clock in the morning Eastern Time and is located 385 miles south-west of Punta Evgenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
During that time, over the Pacific Ocean began to form a single that moves east to the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baha California on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture deep northward to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will lead to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
In the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching Sinclair will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At local level, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid floods, carrying debris streams and likely landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to precipitation from 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected, especially above most of Arizona.
There may be flash floods in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It will be extremely unwise to travel a handful in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain canyons can turn into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to dust and violent winds.
The approaching Sinclair will lead to heavy rains in some parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach precipitation from more than half an inch, which will lead to small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainy season.
Late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain reaches a larger zone on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October can bring great temperature fluctuations to the United States, while the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
Sunday has a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central United States.
There's about 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to increase and expand.
In most of the Central and Eastern United States, a warm start is expected in October, with temperatures of about 80 degrees from the southern plains to the north-east.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the attractive spectacle of the witness nominated for Supreme Court Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford – the woman who accused him of sexual assault that took place in the 80s of the 20th century.
During that time, political opposition continued, as the networks interrupted their regular reverse programmes in the last few minutes of Friday: an agreement that was arranged by the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake and according to which the FBI should conduct a one-week indictment investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh was pushing her drunk and tried to take her clothes off during the high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his devoid of emotion witness, is absolutely clear that such a thing has not happened.
It's likely even more than the Nielsen number of 20.4 million viewers were told to watch the testimony on Friday.
The company has listed the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no directly available data on the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen has also traditionally experienced difficulties measuring the number of people who look from their workplaces.
By comparison, we're talking about an audience similar to that of a championship football game or Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported the appointment of Kavanau, is the first of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, reports from Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to reports from Nielsen CBS, there were 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
Interest has remained high since the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican's office came out with a declaration that he would vote in favour of Kavanau, CNN and CBS cameras shot on Friday as protestors whistled while trying to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judicial Commission.
During all the harassment for a few minutes, he never lifted his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here standing in front of you," a woman said.
"Do you think he presents the truth to the state?
"You have power while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Flake replied that his office had already issued a declaration, and prior to closing the elevator doors, he announced that he would make an additional statement during the committee's hearing.
Cable and broadcasting networks provided live coverage hours later when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer Kavanau's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
Ala Flake said he would only do that if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominees next week, which the Democrats in the opposition are insisting on.
Flake was partially convinced by talks with his friend, the senator from the Party of Democrats, Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns and a few Senator Flek made a decision.
His choice was definitely essential, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanau without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political play" with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "political games" with the future of Britain and to undermine national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published with her on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, stepped up his attack on her so-called "Game Plan" for Brexit, suggesting that the collection of customs fees from the UK for the EU is "fully absurd".
Wade Simms' shooting: Police arrest suspect Ditian Simpson for the LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in Wade Simms' final fatal shooting, the 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Ditian Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned on second-degree murder charges, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, police reporting that Simms had lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS WAFB's branch office.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police announced that he had confessed to a fatal shot at Wade.
His guarantee is set at $350,000, and they're informing him of a lawyer.
The Judicial Medical Service of the East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, indicating a gunshot wound to the head and neck as a cause of death.
The department expresses its gratitude to the Section for the Investigation of Refugees of the Louisiana State Police, the Police Crime Lab, the Southern University police and local residents for the assistance they have provided in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
LSU's Director of Athletic Sports Joe Aleeva thanked local law enforcement authorities for "temporary justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-and-six-inch player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
On average, over the last season, he achieved 5.6 points and 2.6 ricochets of the game.
On Friday morning, LSU's Will Wade's basketball coach reported that the team was “serynut” and “shocked” after Wade's death.
Wade said that “this is something that bothers a person all the time. ”
A volcano scatters ash over Mexico City
Popocatepetal ash thrown out of the volcano reached the southern quarters of the capital city of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater has increased and 183 gas and ash discharges have been recorded in the last 24 hours.
The center was watching a lot of tremors and tremors.
Published in social media pictures show a thin layer of powder that covers the front windows of cars in some of Mexico City’s neighborhoods, such as Hokimilko.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in volcanic activity, which is 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since the earthquake with a Magnitude 7.1 shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalonian separatists ahead of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors clashed with the gendarmerie when thousands joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote for the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began targeting peacekeepers with eggs and dust paint, thus creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets that usually swarm with tourists.
Later in the day, there were other clashes with the police, and police resorted to their clubs to control the situation.
For hours supporting independence groups shouted "We don't forget, we don't forgive", while the declared integrity of the country was returned with "Spain forever".
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical assistance for minor injuries.
The pressure remains high in the region's desirable independence even a year after a 1 October referendum was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist-minded Catalunians.
The vast majority voted whether their vote for independence, although the activity was low, as most opponents of the secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalonian authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in polling stations in the region with a number of violent clashes.
The wanted independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician, joined a separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer holds out hope for Catalonia's chances of independence.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy when they could vote, but now it seems we're stuck," the man added.
Despite the important victory noted, it was also a minor difference in the last December's regional elections, which support Catalonia's independence political parties are experiencing difficulties this year, as many of their most famous leaders are either in self-imposed detention or are arrested awaiting trial because of their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his phone a protest in support of the police, claims the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
His comment is that "it's getting more and more intense".
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine arrested Catalan leaders awaiting a preliminary trial last year, announced he would run for office in the European Parliament elections next year.
He argues that "my candidacy for the European elections is the best way to oppose the regression of democratic values and reprisals observed by the Spanish government".
Londoners: Arrested men after a car crashed into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39, respectively, were arrested after being hit by a car several times in a Londonderi house.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent Thursday around 7:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings announced that there was damage to both the gate and the building itself.
It's also possible that the car was shot with an orb.
Menga's goal is to win Livingston with 1-0 over Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone ensured victory
The Newman in the Livingston High League surprised Rangers and caused only a second loss to Stephen Gerard in his first 18 matches as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's goal proved to be decisive, and Gary Holt's team leveled by the second in the Hibernion class.
Gerard's team remains without a victory on foreign ground in the High League this season, and next Sunday he faces the leader of Harts, who leaves eight points in the ranking.
But before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingstone is already in a series of six games without losing the championship, and Manager Holt still hasn't felt the taste of loss since he replaced Kenny Miller's post last month.
Livingstone missed a good opportunity against the hopeless guests
Holt's team had to lead the score far before he scored a goal, and his direct style of play made Rangers extremely difficult.
Scott Robinson pierced the defense, but his blow went sideways, and then Alan Litgou fired at the beam after Craig Halkett returned the ball head-to-head.
The locals let Rangers play ball, knowing they could seriously make it difficult for static guests.
And that's how it got to the winning goal.
The Rangers committed a breach, and Livingstone played well, as Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined and pulled out Menga, who took the ball and scored from the middle of the penal field.
By that time, Rangers had been in control of the ball more, but they had encountered the unbreakable protection of the hosts, and doorman Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This style of play continued during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make salvation.
Ranger's doorman saved Scott Pittman's leg shot, and a blow to Littlelow's head passed the door after another static position for Livingston.
In Livingstone's criminal field, however, the centrists were easily cleaned, and the judge twice failed to respect the claims of guests for a duspa – first after the rally between Halkett and the Glen Middleton Reserve and then in doubt about playing hand.
"Fenmental" by Livingstone – analysis
Alasair Lamont from BBC Scotland on "Tony Macaroni Arena"
Awesome game and great score for Livingstone.
The team played just great, continuing to overcome expectations and improve its performance.
The style of the game and the composition almost did not undergo changes after the team returned to the League, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes in the field.
Captain Halkett was amazing, organizing the defense in an excellent way, while Menga constantly held Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell under pressure.
At the same time, Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, they demonstrate some great things, but in the case they were very below these standards.
They missed the last pass before naked, and only once they were able to split up the protection of the hosts – this loss should wake the Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan gets a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
Friendship is cooled by problems affecting human rights, freedom of the media and Turkey's admission to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed for Cologne to find a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, the police prevented a 25-thousand crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters who wanted to see their president were still plunging around.
Hundreds protesting Erdogan, many of whom Kurds, also raised their voice, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to allow him into the country.
Various protests reflect a gap caused by a visitor who is accepted as a hero by some German Turks and at the same time is despised as a despot from others.
Road crash in Deptford: Collider rests after collision with car
A car crasher died after a car crash in London.
The disaster took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeastern town, about 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and medical aid arrived, but the biker died instantly.
The disaster occurs several months after another cyclist died after being hit by a runaway driver on Childers Street, located nearly a mile from the site of the Saturday crash.
The capital police have announced that her employees are working on identifying the man, and will then notify his relatives.
The road is closed and the bus lines are diverted, and it is also recommended that motorists avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in a riot
Six prison guards were injured in a male prison riot with a high level of security reported by the Prison Service.
The riot broke out in Long Lartin prison in Worcester at approximately 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and still continues.
In order to master it, special officials from the Tordano squad have been called upon to cope with eight deprivations of liberty, as the insurgency itself has been confined to one wing of the prison.
The injured overseers suffered minor injuries to the individuals and received medical attention on the spot.
The Prison Service spokesman made the following statement: “Specially trained officers are invited to deal with the incident in Long Lartin prison.
Six guards received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we very clearly declare that the responsible persons will be handed over to the police, as far as their sentences may be extended."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after the prisoner's attack, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, police officers from riot control units were called to prison, where they could master a heavy riot where staff were attacked by billard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens with lightning flooding Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although dry areas may benefit)
Arizona rarely happens to be hit by a tropical storm, but it is very likely that this is what happens early next week, while the weakening hurricane Rosa is carried through the desert south-west, leading to the risk of lightning flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already established posts against flash floods on Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including in the towns of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Finland on Tuesday, and on late Monday she can bring rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center provide 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Pool, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of rain in separate places.
For those who are not threatened by lightning floods, the rain caused by Rosa may actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, some of the rain is likely to be useful, as the southwest part is currently on dry land.
According to the US Dry Period Monitoring Commission, less than 40% of Arizona suffer from at least excessive drought, which is the second heavyweight category," reports the weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to reaching land on the Baha California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who can still boast at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, is located 385 miles from Punta Evgenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets with colder waters over the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
It is therefore expected to reach land in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over a part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of boredom.
"A total of rains are expected from up to 6 inches from Baha California to northwestern Sonora, with possible up to 10 inches," the weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will head north in Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Utah by Tuesday late evening.
"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely heavy rain in Baha California, Northwest Sonora and the desert south-west of the United States," the National Hurricane Center warned.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening lightning floods and bringing various waste streams to the deserts as well as dumpsters in the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old child was found with stab wounds in Summersett.
The early boy was discovered in the area of Excelsior Terrace at Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
It is situated in a hospital where its condition remains “stable”.
At night in the Radstock area, a boy was arrested at the age of 17, two boys at the age of 18 and a 20-year-old man reported to the police in Avon and Summersett.
The cops are asking anyone who might have recorded what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh "stricken by the anger and anger" of the democratic party
"Every vote for Judge Kavanau is a vote that rejects the corrupt and outrageous tactics of the democratic party," Trump announced at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Kavanau "suffered from the insolence and anger" of the democratic party during its nomination.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, firmly rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault charge decades ago when two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the prosecution hearing.
The president made a statement Saturday that "today the American people have witnessed the intelligence, courage and qualities" of Kavanaugh.
"Every vote in favour of Judge Kavanau is a voice in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a real lawyer with a wonderful reputation in the service of the public," the president said in front of a crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president indirectly saw the nomination of Kavanau as he spoke about the importance of the Republican votes for the general elections.
"They leave five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
Although I'm not a candidate, I'm actually a part of it too," Trump continued.
"I am therefore going around and fighting to support good candidates."
Trump noted that the Democrats set a mission "to prevent and hinder".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for the nomination of Kavanau is expected to be held no later than Friday, as a member of the senior representative of the Republican Party reported to CNN.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims increased
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were taken from the shallow shorelines by giant waves, when a severe earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when the coast was swept away by waves of up to six feet (18 feet) high, taking many to their death and destroying everything in their path.
Tsunami sprawled after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, which is why many became victims of the disaster," he announced during a briefing at Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the spokesman for the Indonesian BNPB Disaster Management Agency.
"The water was drawn with it cars, trees, whole houses, defeated everything in its path," Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed the trees and managed to save themselves from the water," he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Published by the disaster agency photos from the air showed many destroyed buildings and shops, broken and twisted bridges, as well as a water mosque.
The secondary quakes continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released from the Friday massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the tsunami size.
Nugroho described the damage as “great” and specified that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found below the ruins of the collapsed buildings, the speaker added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said the victims and damages could be higher along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the rabbit.
He also added that "communications are completely suppressed and there is no information from Donggal".
The Red Cross indicated that there were more than 300,000 people living there, adding that his teams and volunteers had already headed to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get even more difficult."
On Saturday, the agency was fiercely criticised for not informing about the defeat of Palou Tsunami, although officials explained that the waves had arrived during the announcement.
Shared in social media amateur videos show a man upstairs on a building who yells at people on the street panic warnings about the approaching tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall plunges into the shore and relates both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the authenticity of the video in a timely manner.
The earthquake and the tsunami have led to a severe power cut-off that has prevented communications around Palo and has made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, communicated by the responsible authorities, but the evacuated still desperately needed food and other essential products.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue operations and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Wiidodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palley on Sunday.
Those killed in the Indonesian Tsunami are already over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision officials from Donggala have managed to get safely to Palu, where they have found refuge in tarpaulin shelters scattered in the yard of their office, they have passed a number of scenes of desolation, Mr Doseba says.
"They told me they saw countless destroyed houses."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite work on rescue and recovery teams, some complain that foreign rescue workers in such situations are hindered from reaching Palu.
Under the Indonesian regulations, financing, the sending of personnel and supplies from abroad can only start if the site is declared a national disaster zone.
And this hasn't happened yet.
"The disaster is still regional," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government has announced that it is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but from there they have not yet declared such a status."
While Palu falls the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those still unknown continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones somehow survived natural disasters.
A little boy was pulled out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescue workers released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother's body.
Gendon Subando, the coach of Indonesia's national paraplaneism team, trained two of the missing paraplanners for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the trapped in the Roa-Roa Hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi added.
"When I am older in the field of paraplannerism, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours following the news of the crash of the Roa-Roa Hotel reached the Paraplanerism Community, he was desperate to send messages to whatsApp to the contestants in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue notes, however, the only response to his messages was a single gray one.
"I think this means that the messages are not delivered," he added.
Thieves raise $26,750 during an ATM charge in Newport on the Levy.
On Friday morning, thieves raised $26,750 from a brink employee who loaded an ATM at the Newport Levy, it became clear from a press release at the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the amusement complex and prepared to charge it with money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “began running behind the back of Brink’s servant ” and stole a purse of money.
Witnesses have noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, the report continues, but police have not indicated the number involved in the theft.
All who have information on the identity of the suspects must contact the NYPD on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kanie West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The man officially known as Kanie West”.
West, 41, has for some time worn the nickname Ye and has used it as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change precedes his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He turns singer Ariana Grande into the show, which gave up "for emotional reasons", the show's creator tells us.
In addition to reducing his current professional name, West had previously claimed that the word had religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you' or 'you'," West shared earlier this year as he discussed the title of his album with Radio Guide Big Boy.
"This way I am you, I am us, it is us.
You have gone from Canie, which means only one person, just to Ye – which is a reflection of the good in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our essence."
The rapper is one of the many known in his sphere who changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and names, including Puff Dadi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preferences to the alias Love and Brader Love.
One of West's former associates, J.Z., also presented himself in a version with or without a track and/or capital letters in his nickname.
The President of Mexico vowed not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore he would never use military force. This happened as the country nears its 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza President López Obrador promised "never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people while student movements with left political views gradually spread among Latin America.
López Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and finding more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attracts young people to criminal gangs.
The US needs to double funding for the development of the II
At a time when China becomes increasingly active on the front of developing artificial intelligence, the US has to double its research budget in this area, according to the researcher and developer of II Kai-Fu Loi, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various U.S. government units made statements on the topic of II, although the US generally does not have an official strategy for II.
During that time, China presented its plan last year: the country seeks to become number 1 since innovation in the II by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for the development of the IE will be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the US and are about to make further breakthroughs with regard to the II," Lee said.
Double funding can also double the chances for the next major achievement in the field of I.I. to come from the United States, as Lee informed CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book “The Supremes of II: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the largest companies for II in China – Face++.
In the 80s of the last century, Carnegie Melon Lee worked on an II system that beat the most successful hijacker in America, then he was executive director at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee owes his dues to the previous technology competitions of the federal government, such as the robotics competition of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects, and asked when the next one would be to help identify the new visionaries.
"Studies in the United States often have to work hard to win government funding," Leigh said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the corporations," the man said.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university luminaires to work on II.
Lee also claims that changes in immigration policy can help the United States strengthen its II programme.
"I think that doctors in I.I. have to automatically offer green cards," the man said.
The U.S. National Council announced its plan for the development of artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other state organizations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee points out.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners from the industry and academic communities, and from the White House announced the formation of the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA reported an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, they are currently investing more than $100 million a year in the development of the II.
Meanwhile, the US legislature, which wanted to establish the National Committee on Security on artificial intelligence, has not observed any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum whether to change the name of their country
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum this Sunday on whether the name of the state should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia". This is a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name represents claims against its territorial integrity, which therefore requires its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority of Macedonia.
President Gheorghe Ivanov said he himself would not vote in the referendum, while his boycott campaign casts a shadow of doubt as to whether the referendum would reach the minimum 50 per cent required to recognise its validity.
The issue of newsletters is: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the formed state of Macedonia after the collapse of the country of Macedonia into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to give my vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum does not have binding force, enough members of parliament have said that they will comply with the result to such a extent that the vote already has a decisive burden.
In order to change the name of the state, two thirds of the parliamentary representatives must vote on it.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there were no irregularities reports by 1 afternoon.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters visited the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will find the way to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small scene at 54 and arranged chairs in front of tents lined with boycotting referendums.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the servants' gates," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev argues that NATO membership will lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after I put my own voice out.
The State party also stated that the positive result would result in "reaffirming the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies published the results of a study, suggesting that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is below the required activity.
Another study by Macedonian TV Telma reported that 57% of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote "Yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum is unsuccessful, it will be the first serious blow against the pro-Western government policy since it won power last May.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through Brighton's entire defense and scores the goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling took over Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Steadiam in Manchester, England.
The play of Aguero naked in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goldsmith was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran three defenses from Brighton before sprinting with the ball in the empty space forward.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He sneaked past one of the defense attorneys, then left behind the rest of his men on the border of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he filed it left on Sterling.
The English attacker with one touch brought the ball back to Aguero, who with a right-hand kick over Brighton Matthew Ryan's doorman and found the right-hand corner of his door.
"Aguero fights some injuries in his legs," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We planned for him to play about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky you scored a goal at this very moment."
But Sterling was the one who secured the initial advance of the "heavens" in this match from the English League.
He signed in the 29th minute.
In the naked Aguero situation, he was served deep in Brighton's half.
He immediately released the exit pass on the left flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sanne advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a pass on the far beam.
The attacker of the "heavens" managed to detect close, just before the ball went out.
City will face Hofengheim in a match at 12:55 p.m. in the championship league group phase on Tuesday afternoon at Rain Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shercer wants to play determine the fate of the Rockies
After Nationals didn't qualify for the playoffs, there's no particular point in another game of title-starting pitcher.
Yet always the ambitious Shercer hopes to be the titler Sunday against Colorado Rockies if the match matters for the Rockies that lead with a single match to Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West ranking.
Rockies guaranteed participation at least in the Wild Card match after winning the 5-2 against Nationals on Friday night, but it is still not certain that they will win their first title in the Division.
"Although we ourselves are not fighting for anything, we want to finish the season with a nice game in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win perhaps the most important match for them in the year.
Why would I want to miss such a game?"
Nationals still haven't announced a starter pitcher for Sunday, but they're supposed to let Chercer participate if the game is decisive.
For Chercer, this would be the 34th game as starting pitcher this year, having a practice on Thursday and having the normal rest time by Sunday.
The right-hand pitcher of Washington has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 inning during this season.
Trump picks up supporters in West Virginia
The President hinted at the situation with his election to Supreme Court Brett Kavanau as he spoke about the importance of the Republican votes in the general elections.
"In November, everything we have achieved will be at risk.
There are five weeks left to one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the biggest moments in current history – I also declare that although I am not a candidate, I am a real participant too, that is why I am fighting with all the strengths for the right candidates," Trump said.
Then he continued with “You all see this horrible, horrifying radical group of democracies, you see them with your eyes.
They're determined to regain power in any way, you're witness to their incorruptibleness, to their wickedness.
They don't care when they can hurt who they have to run over to get into power and government because they only care about government and government, but we won't give them."
The Democrats, according to the president, have set themselves the goal "to prevent and hinder".
"What we all see in the last four days," he continued, calling the Democrats "wrathful, vile, and unfaithful".
The president reminded the Senate Judicial Commission, mentioning Democrat Senator Diane Fainstein by name, which sparked strong riots from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you distribute the document?
I'm sorry, what?
No, no, I was waiting – it was a really bad gesture – perhaps the worst I have ever seen.”
The Leibarists are no longer open-minded.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I am just the last member of the Labour Parliament for now, who was told that he was not welcome – just because I speak frankly.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar attitude because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship has criticized me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, those that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy disagreed in the time of previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday stated that “we want meetings to include all and be beneficial. ”
In most of my eight years as a local representative of Labour in Parliament, Friday meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and promises of a “lighter and more measured” policy have long been forgotten if ever they were on the agenda.
It was becoming increasingly evident that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion was judged on the basis of how much the party's leadership was attracted to.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I had previously considered to share similar political views began to expect me to make a reverse turn and take positions with which I would never agree – either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I say – there is a whole offensive tirade in social networks, where it calls for revocation, rejection of moderate politics, statements that I do not belong to the Labour.
Like this, it's not just happening to me.
In the interest of truth, I know that I have even made more luck than some of my colleagues, since comments about me are at least mostly of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purpose of these colleagues who face sexist or racist swings every day without being afraid of them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how similar insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer wide-ranging, with any sign of distrust or change of the rules of choice becoming more narrower.
In the last two years, I have received many suggestions to keep quiet, not to talk so much, and then “everything will be fine. ”
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour family 32 years ago as a student provoked by the Government of Thatcher, which through neglect led to a literal breakdown at my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – either as a local advisor or as a minister.
I have never hidden my political views, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political position and my disagreement with my current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state reaches Braxit, it will harm households, firms and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the Labour.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of withdrawal or political exclusion will refuse me to act in the way I consider best in protecting your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: The Invincible Air led in the rankings
The two late essays may have changed slightly the final score, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match of the Tennent High League.
The team is already heading the ranking and the only one of the ten teams is without a loss until now.
Better protection and better use of opportunities proved decisive in the game, from which coach Peter Murchi and his team can be very pleased.
"I am happy because other teams have tested us quite seriously in past matches, and we are still without loss," Merchi said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations on Air really took advantage of their situation better than we did. ”
The essay of Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional blow by Frazir Klimo, brought Eer forward in the result, but a yellow card for the Scottish national Rory Hughes, released to play in the game by Wariers, allowed Melrose to catch up in the result after Jason Bagot realized the essay followed by an unsuccessful additional blow.
Klimo increased the lead for Air from a penalty blow just before halftime, noting the essay after solo action, and then realizing the additional blow, with which he made the score of 17-5 for Air on vacation.
But Melrose began the second half well and the essay of Patrick Anderson, followed by a successful additional blow to Bagot, reduced the lead to only five points.
It followed a prolonged suspension of the game due to the severe contusion of Ruard Nott, who was carried out on the stretcher, and after the renewal of the match Air increased their advance after the essay of Stafford McDoual and a successful additional blow by Klimo.
Then the acting captain of Air Blair McPherson received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their many advantages by exerting strong pressure and by implementing the essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by a failed additional blow.
However, the hosts regained their spirit's presence, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after knocking down Klimo without a ball, the subsequent criminal play of McFherson realized an essay with the help of an advanced offensive line of Air.
The climate realized the additional blow, not long after he did it again, after Kyle Row caught the kicked ball from David Armstrong and pulled Gregor Henry's wing on the flank for the five essays of the hosts.
The star from Still Game seems to be heading for a new career in the restaurant business
The star from Still Game Ford Kiernan seems to be heading towards a more direct and warm adult after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular BBC show, also being a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his long-standing comedy partner, Greg Hemphyll.
The two announced that the coming ninth season would be the last to broadcast, as Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a source from the Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan had intended to join Glasgow's “a thriving restaurant business”.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia hopes to reopen the way to the Pacific
The seamen are constantly patrolling the seafronts at La Paz.
Over public buildings, a blue flag of the ocean lies.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the motto: “Our sea is legal.
It's our duty to get it back."
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still alive – as well as the call to sail again from the Pacific.
In fact, this hope is currently the strongest for decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1st, after five years have gone by.
"The power is in Bolivia, there is a sense of cheerfulness and unity everywhere, as the country expects a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadila.
Many Bolivians will watch the international court's verdict on the big screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's demand and that after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Here is Morales, Bolivia's charismatic local president, who is due to go to a contested re-election battle next year, also placed a lot and a lot on the court's judgment Monday.
"We are very close to getting our access to the Pacific," Moralez promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the likelihood of the court making a decision in favour of Bolivia is quite small, and even if it were to do so, it would not change things in reality.
The UN body located in the Netherlands does not have the authority to take Chile's territory and has decided that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the verdict of an international court is only six months after the final arguments are heard indicates that the case is “not complex”, says Paz Zarat, Chilean international law expert.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may actually have hurt her.
"The problem with access to the ocean has been torn apart by Bolivia's current government," Zarat said.
Then he hinted that Morales' military rhetoric had distinguished and Chile's little will remained.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at any time, but it will be extremely difficult after a normal dialogue has taken place.
Both sides have not maintained diplomatic missions in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
According to him, on Monday, Bolivia will have "an incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile", as well as a chance to "extreme 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefits for both countries".
Kalzadila also rejected the idea that Morales – who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the problem of access to the ocean as a "political path."
"Bolivia will never give up her right to go out to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome our past problems."
North Korea claims it will not continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his country will never proceed to nuclear disarmament first if it is unable to trust Washington.
Ri presented his speech Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep the promises made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment came after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared on the edge to restart the bottomless nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Young Won of North Korea.
Ri called it “an empty hope” the idea that continuing with the sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration that would end the Korean war would make the North kneel.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture along the path of disarmament.
Both Kim and the president of the United States of America, Donald Trump, want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that in Pyongyang are serious about abandoning the arsenal, which they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion reviews reveal the latest screaming on massive hats that will soon be in fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun’s rays, you don’t need to look for more.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which embroidered the fashion podium during the Fashion Week in Paris.
A lot of impractical hats caused a wave in Instagram in the summer, and designers sent out their creations to scavenge the fashion community.
Valentino's exhausting proposal was an extravagant beige hat with a similar feather wide periphery that literally swallowed the heads of the models.
The other too large accessories included jewelry, a magic hat, and even pineapple, but they do not aim to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and reminded not as much of the higher fashion as Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled a full set of snorkels and glasses, while the other looked like a melted funnel of ice cream.
If you're into these fashion trends, you're lucky.
Fashion specialists predict that giant hats will soon be sold in fashion shops near you.
The huge hats come shortly after the La bomb – the two-foot straw hat that was seen on the heads of everyone – from Ryana to Emily Ratajkovski..
The cult towards the extremely impractical hat that took over social networks led to the emergence of another huge design of the fashion podium – a straw beach bag, almost as big as the wearing it with a swim model.
The Rafi bag with the color of an overburned orange, with slices of a Rafi and with a white leather handle, was the attractor of all the views of the article in the collection of La Riviera SS19 of Jacquesmus during the Fashion Week in Paris.
Stylist of celebrities Luke Armitide told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – after the designer has made such a big impression, it will be difficult to ignore the search for expensive accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, as this continues in 2018 with another excellent presentation of the results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports disciplines, art, music and other social sciences.
With up to 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their careers and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can compile and implement a personal curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in an understanding language about him, your words can reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year's exams, we see that languages are first with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved high marks A.
The data collected by 74 members of SCIS schools showed that 72% of students achieved the Chinese A rating, with the same estimate being 72% of the students in German, 69% of the students in French and 63% of those in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland accept foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need for the future.
Currently, languages as subject to free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in and beyond independent schools.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the Employment and Occupational Skills Commission of the United Kingdom showed that for reasons of difficulty in finding employees, 17% indicated insufficient language competences.
Therefore, the rule of foreign languages is becoming more and more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require the rule of foreign language, which turns these skills into essentials in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if a person masters a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, once he has a similar skill that remains for a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the ruling few languages a person’s chest in front of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov among more than 4,000 UK citizens of years of age in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak a language, as French was the only language whose possession reached a two-digit percentage of 15%.
That is why investment in language learning is important to children today.
Managing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland every school will differ from the language taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the United Kingdom in the future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, as teachers will be specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to succeed in life, no matter what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that, in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of any country that needs to be taken into account in the educational system.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron's making his debut for Lakers this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are tripping to see LeBron James' first game with Los Angeles Lakers' team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will take part in the first game of pre-season training against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still hasn't been specified how many minutes he's going to play in the fight.
"It will be on the ground between one and 48 minutes", Joke Walton announced via Lakers' official website.
The reporter for Lakers Mike Truel announced in Tweeter that James is likely to play relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of Lakers' pre-season training.
"At this stage of my career, I do not need pre-seasonal matches to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of election rallies tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Trump rally, which includes stops in known places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Postponing its confirmation vote for the election to fill a free seat at the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as Republicans are threatened by the loss of control over Congress in the submission of votes in November.
What time will Trump's West Virginia rally be held tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Wieling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19, Eastern time this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Wieling, West Virginia, below by broadcasting live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to review this week's hearings about Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh, in which tensions arise due to allegations of immoral sexual acts, which kept the Senate's confirmatory vote for a week while an investigation is under way by the FBI.
However, the main objective of this series of rallies is to help Republicans raise momentum for the November elections.
Therefore, President Donald Trump's campaign announced that these five rallies next week aim to "activate volunteers and supporters as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so essential to its programme that the President will visit as many states as possible and we are starting a campaign season full of commitments," Reuters told Trump's campaign spokesman, who refuses to be mentioned.
The rally tonight, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wieling, can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump's second visit this month will be to West Virginia, a state in which he won more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate candidate from West Virginia, Republican Patrick Morris, who is missing in sociological research.
"It is not a good sign for Maurice that the President has come to give him impetus in sociological research," said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
"Rayder Cup" 2018: The US team will fight until the last, keeping its hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without intrigue, “forsom” matches during the Sunday afternoon may have brought what Ryder Coop needed.
Changing the advantage of sport is a rather subjective concept, in which players believe in an unreserved, even more in competitions like this.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They ran by six points, and now they're only four, so I guess we've picked a little bit of momentum," said Jordan Spite at the end of today's racing day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage of four points at only twelve more to be allocated.
As Spitt says, however, Americans have more to show and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge the sport form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each of them took three of the four possible points.
Spit shows an excellent shape from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the real leader of his team.
The cheering sounds of the fans grew stronger as he progressed in the round, in which with a precise blow he leveled the score in the fourth match, after he and Thomas left with two punches after the first two holes.
His blow, which won them the 15th hole match, was met with strong enthusiastic reactions that make us believe that really not everything is lost for the American team.
"It is important not to think about anything else and focus on your own game," Spitt says.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable heroes of Ryder Coop so far.
The strange but delightful couple from Europe won four out of four, and they seem to get it all together.
Mollywood was the only couple who didn't make "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they also didn't have "rich" on Saturday mornings, or Friday afternoons or mornings.
These successive successes, as well as the way that they were passing energy between them and enthusiastic fans, confirmed the view that they were the players who would win Sunday and there would be no better couple than Flintwood and Molinari, who would bring Europe's potential victory as the sun set over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The tales of European glory, however, turned out to be a little premature.
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the "fourball" matches from the morning, while he partnered with Alex Noren.
"Gods" and two "dabs" of the first nine holes put the Spaniard and a Swede into problems they could not cope with.
In Sunday's games, however, there's no way anyone else can solve your problems.
"Fourball" and "fours" matches are extremely interesting to look closely at the interaction between couples, the advice they exchange with each other, and the way a strategy can undergo changes at any moment.
The Europeans played better teamwork and therefore gained a significant lead before the last day, but this "fours" session showed that the American team was also ready to fight until the last – something in which many people, especially in the United States, were highly doubtful.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid lead before the last day of Ryder Coop, after leading the United States 10-6 after playing the games of the forms "Fourball" and "Fours" on Saturday.
The inspiring duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari began with two victories against the unconvincing Tiger Woods, with which their assets at the Le Golf National event grew to four points.
In an attempt to win back the trophy, which lost Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated tomorrow's "fourball" games over Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and in the end Europe won the 3-1 win series.
The U.S. has put up more resistance in the "fours" games, where they won two wins, but failed to cut the difference.
Jim Furick's team needs 8 points from the 12 singles game on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first recruit from Europe to win four points in a row, and he and the Molinars, known as "Molliowood", after this sensational weekend only became the second pair to win four points of his first four matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
After unappealingly beating Woods and Patrick Reid in the "fourball" matches, they were extremely motivated to beat the break of Woods and US recruit Bryson Dekamba with an even more categorical score of 5.4.
Woods, who had barely gone through his two games on Saturday, had only occasionally demonstrated the flashes of his genius, but so far there were 19 losses from 29 games in "fourball" and "fours" matches, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who was given a break for tomorrow's "fourball" games, is partnering with Henrik Stanson in the "fours" collisions in the 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopka – number one and number three in the world, respectively.
However, the team of Europe failed to enjoy a completely pleasant, cool and cloudless day south-west of Paris.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, regained America's hopes by winning two points on Saturday.
They won a difficult victory with 2§1 against Spaniard John Ram and Jan Polter in the "fourball" games, and later returned to defeat Polter and Rory Makilroy with 4&3 in the "fours" meetings, even though they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Coop, a team happened to catch up on four points of deficit before singles, and according to the regulation, Furic's team would retain the trophy even under equality.
But since they were outgunned in two consecutive days, it seems their chances of turning back on Sunday are not particularly high.
North Korea says there is no way to disarm unilaterally, without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the UN on Saturday that the continuing sanctions deepened the distrust of the United States and there is no way for the country to abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the world organisation Ri Young-hoe said that during the last year "significant goodwill measures" have been taken, for example, we stop nuclear and missile tests, destroy the nuclear test site and promise not to spread nuclear weapons and technologies.
"Despite this, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security, and under no circumstances can we disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Rie expressed the well-known complaints by North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "peak" approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded, as it has taken step-by-step measures, his statement seemed significant since it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Cheng-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", and Trump gave guarantees for security in North Korea.
North Korea seeks an official end to the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the US says that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also countered calls for the relief of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists "to remove nuclear weapons first" and increase pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal through coercion, and even object to "the declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
"The realization that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a meaningless dream of those who don't know us.
The problem, however, is that continuing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting was planned between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed earlier than a week ago.
Instead, the minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If the country on nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a halt.
However, Ri’s tone of speech was significantly different from the previous year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of North Korean missiles to the continental part of the United States was inevitable, after Trump called Kim “a man-rocket” on a suicide mission.
This year at UN Trump, which threatened North Korea with “complete destruction”, praised Kim for his courage to take measures to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea removed nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there was no time limit for this and said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "implementation of the Security Council sanctions must necessarily continue until complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop financing the nuclear programme and the ballistic missile programme of Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ri in the towers at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but only a few hours later, North Korea accused him of making "gangster requests".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States took “the appropriate measures”.
According to him, Kim told him that “the appropriate measures” he sought were the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students on a school vacation course
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all students sleep more in an attempt to overcome the growing learning culture “all night” with caffeine.
The teacher found that students at university number one in the world often do not even think about the very foundations of how to care for themselves.
Charles Keysler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and the Women's Hospital, has developed a course he believes to be the first in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At last a girl came to me and said, ‘Why do they tell me just now, in my last year?’
She said no one has ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to the students the most important of how good sleep habits help academic and sporting achievements, as well as to improve overall well-being.
Paul Bareira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after students were found to suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in the dorm, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, marathons and books to explain to them the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements affect the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of sleeping routine.
In another part of the participants, it tells how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change students' behaviour.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health effects of the choice to smoke," added Professor Keysler.
The culture of pride from "learning all night" still exists, he said, and added that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Securing sufficient and quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says – even to avoid filling, as deprivation of sleep puts the brain in a hunger regime, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old student in California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Keysler in the course, taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says that his course “opened his eyes ” and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It hopes that the next step is for all graduates to be asked to complete such a training programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Keysler recommends that students consider setting up an alarm for both sleep and wake and knowing the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted from electronic screens and LED light that can upset the circus rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal broke Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke Stephen Gerard's mindless team and won 1-0 for Livingstone.
The team of Ibrox wanted to record its first victory as a guest of the triumph in February 4-1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team did only the second defeat of Gerard in his 18th fight as a manager who left his team with eight points less than Harts' detached team, leader of the Ladbrokes High League.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the team of Rangers deprived of constructive ideas at no time seemed close to alignment.
After the Rangers game, they withdrew to the sixth place, and Livingstone is now third, leaving the second Hibernian only in the first place.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems, as Foreign Judge Callum Spence received a head wound after he was hit with an object that was apparently thrown by guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that destroyed Air in the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same Eleventh of Livingstone who pulled a point against Harts last week, and should be pleased with the way his aggressive team was partaking all the actions of the opponent.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingstone did better in the rarest cases where they owned it.
They had to mark back in the second minute that Menga took off with one touch of Scott Pittman against the goalie Alan MacGregor, but the half-protector missed the good opportunity.
Later on, Keegan Jacobs' focus from foul found Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense, Alan Litgou, turned the ball off the back beam.
Rangers have taken control of the game, but have failed to create anything meaningful in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there should be an ass in the 15th minute he ran into Steven Lawles, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's claim.
Rangers only took two exact hits in the first half, but the former doorman from Ibrox Liam Kelly was able to handle the blow with Lasana Kulibali's head and the faint shot of these Ejarias.
Although Livi's 34th-minute hit was surprising with regard to the possession of the ball, it was totally deserved.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' deep centering.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who in cold blood handed it to Menga, for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacted to the holiday by replacing Kulibali with Ryan Kent and this shift almost immediately led to the result when the wing passed to Morelos, but impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the strike.
Livingstone, however, continued to force the guests to play in a comfortable home-style game, such as Litgou and Halkett constantly bounced long balls forward.
Holt's team was able to increase its lead in the last few minutes, but MacGregor managed to deal with Jacobs' blow, and in the wake of that, Corner Litgou fired with his head on the beam.
Entrance as Glen Middleton's Reserve from Rangers asked for a bid at the end of the fight after fighting with Jacobs, but Thomson again saw nothing wrong with the situation.
Year: The inventor of the Geiger counter
Page from our yearbook Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROENE... the day the future physicist Johan Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger develops a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately leads to the creation of a device known as a Geiger counter.
A cornerstone in science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a cornerstone of pop culture, when in 1950 the film “Coronado Cambins” was released, in which apparently amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated.
Man: “What in God’s name is this?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium..
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms separated from the radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Surely shoots right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945 just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live.

A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to see and kill foreign cells
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them into a laboratory.
Then they can “see” a protein that is common to many cancers and are injected back into the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with a vaccine that trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them into the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many types of cancer called HER2 and then inject themselves again into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofski of the U.S. National Oncology Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine. ”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer”, including the breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach to making immune cells of patients and their “training” how to target cancer cells has been used to treat leukaemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat marked "Let's make America big again", with his participation in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was whistled at the studio during Saturday Night Live after making a pointless performance, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Let's make America great again", he announced against the Democrats and announced his support for Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they ask me, ‘ How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America long ago," he said.
SNL launched the show with Matt Damon's participation, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee for Complaints of Sexual Violence by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's record was uploaded to the social media by Chris Rock's comic book.
It's not clear why Rock tried to mock West with his publication.
Besides, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
"Tormose me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
They've stopped me!
And then they say I'm on a sinking ship," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the sinking ship?" claiming to wear Superman's suit because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love."
Comments sparked at least twice the public whistles and SNL team members seemed embarrassed, Variety said, one of them said: "The whole studio shut up."
West was invited at the last minute to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMiller, died a few days ago.
West puzzles many with the performance of the song “I Love It, ” dressed as a bottle of “Perie”.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Kandes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “On one of the bravest: thank you to meet the crowd.”
Leading on the show Karen Hunter, however, wrote on Twitter that West simply "was himself and that's wonderful."
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (when I buy music or his clothes or support his 'art'), who I think welcomes and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That's who we are," she added.
Before the show, the rapper said on Twitter that he changed his name, now "is now officially known as Kenny West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's following Didi's example, also known as Puff Santa, Puffy and Pi Didi.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dog, his name was Snoop Lyon, and his musical legend Prince changed his name with a symbol.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Prosecutor's Office.
The star of the Game of Thrones Keith Harrington is against toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for the role of the swinging sword John Snow in a violent medieval fantasy NGO Game of Thrones series.
But the actor, who is 31 years old, has been opposed to the macho hero stereotype, saying that showing such roles on the screen often leads young people to think that they should be "serious" in order to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed that "something had gone wrong" and asked how to deal with the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his partner from the “Game of Thrones” Rose Leslie, also at 31, admits that he feels “solidly convinced” that this problem must be resolved.
"I am personally convinced at the moment – what have we confused about masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach admiring men about the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television can partly be responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to many masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught by television and on the street that makes guys feel that they should become this particular type of man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time – how can we change it?
Because obviously something's wrong with young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in the prehistoric or continuations of the "Game of Thrones" after the end of the series in the next summer, claiming that he "has finished with the battlefields and horses".
Since November Keith will be playing in Sam Shepherd's "True West" restoration, a film producer story and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that getting to know his wife, Rose, was the best thing that ever happened in the "Game of Thrones".
"I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my future family and determined my life ahead of time," he said.
Rose plays Igrit, the girl that Keith John Snow's hero falls in love with, in a fantasy show, the winner of the Emmy Award.
They both married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
According to health services in the country, more than 820,000 people are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contact, which marks a change compared to the past.
Traditionally HIV spreads rapidly to some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, China's health services said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, each year the number of those living with HIV and spin in China is increasing by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people in the communities of the KGB was widespread.
According to studies, 70-90% of men who have had sexual contact with men are eventually married to women because of conservative values.
Many cases of disease transmission are due to incorrect protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of the effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies data leaks to senators from the Republican party, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, US House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of her team had published personal information to three U.S. senators from Republicans on legislators' pages in Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were made by experts and websites of the "ultra right wing".
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a hearing of the Senate's assembly on allegations of immoral sexual behaviour against the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak was made after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the publications, is related to Waters' office, and released information about a member of its team, according to Hill.
"This unsubstantiated claim is completely wrong and is an absolute lie," continued Waters.
“The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely wrong and is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked criticism online, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Flysher.
"There is anger in this denial," Fleisher wrote.
"This implies that she does not have the temperament suitable for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be challenging.
I shouldn't question the prosecutor's motives.
He must be calm and balanced."
Fleisher compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who was accused of critics that he also seemed angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“It’s true, if true,” he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office saw the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities about these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be brought under legal responsibility for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
"Johnny English Blows Up Again" – the weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for links to Brakzit in any new film with British participation and it seems that this applies to the revival of the action comedy, spy franchise for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and returned in 2011 with "Johnny English is coming back".
Will self-washing and mimics that tell us how obvious it is that we are stupid turn into a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with its eyes cut and the “gum” face has the permission to renew things for the second time – his name is of the greatest importance when it comes to a great comical creation designed for fans of cinema who do not speak English.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims of flattering glamour, owns little of Clouseau, little of Mr. Bean and much of the man who contributed with a note on the music theme Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In addition, it was originally based on the chaos left behind by a traveler and an international man, whom Atkinson played in Barclaycard's already forgotten TV commercials.
In the last Johnny English movie, there are two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing medieval armor, and short of the wigs were stuck in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy and obvious, but humor is rather weak and strangely devoid of, especially when "serious" film brands such as "007" and "mission impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humor seems more towards children than adults, and Johnny English's crazy accidents are not innovative and focused in my opinion, as there is no Actinson game reminds Mr. Bean.
Always the current assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker hacked the British super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all operatives for the horror of the duty agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is puffed up and pompous and already suffering from a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this quasi-Tereza-Mae role, but in the script there is nothing to do.
Her intelligence advisors have informed her that she needs to summon a retired agent, as all active agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a teacher at a chico center, but who illegally teaches lessons on how to be an undercover agent: there are some good hits here when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English was called to Whitehall for emergency briefing and is reunited with his former longtime assistant Bo, playing again by Ben Miller.
Because he's already a family man married to a submarine commander, a cheerful role, in which Vicky Pepperdin's talent is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the great problems of Her Majesty's secret services and face the fatal beautiful Ophelia Buletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the creepy Jason Walta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their odyssey from farce: dressed as waiters, set fire to a French restaurant; create chaos when they sneak into the luxury yacht of Volta; and English causes a real anarchy when trying to use a helmet for virtual reality to get to know the interior of Volta's house.
All smiles are certainly taken from the previous film, but since so cute and lush, there is a lot more content for children.
A lot of mediocre production.
Just like the other Johnny English movies, I keep thinking, can't the British film industry give Atkinson a role that fits his talent?
Leiberians deny that they are developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is considering a radical plan whereby the British work four weeks a week but get paid for five.
The party claims that it wants the heads of companies to provide the economies created by the revolutionary artificial intelligence (II) to the workers by giving them another day off.
She wants the workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would "past" the economic programme and the party's plans to shake the country for the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A higher source of the Labour Party said before The Sunday Times: "It is expected that before the end of the year a review of politics will be announced.
"It will not happen immediately, but the four-day working week is a quest that fits into the approach of rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its joint election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this quest does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour speaker said: "The four-day working week is not in the party's politics.
The shadow chancellor John McDonald used the Labour Conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take the power back from the "no-personal directors" and the " speculators" in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that the current owners of shares in water supply companies may not receive their entire share, as the Liberian government could impose "concernings" on the basis of the violations found.
In addition, he confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and set up privatisation funds to transfer 10 per cent of the net capital to private companies of employees who can acquire dividends of up to 500 pounds per year.
Lyndsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about 60 minutes ago whether Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of the bureau could lead some of the senators of the Republican party to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, “60 minutes” correspondent Scott Pelli asked senators from the Republican party John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I want to say, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after that statement came out, and asked him, "Have you made it?"
He was determined, resolute and unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh, and to change that, a shaking accusation is necessary," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it categorically," Graham added, turning to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one she mentioned but could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen festival and does it even help reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive composition of performers and performs just as impressive a mission: the elimination of poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the great seabed in Central Park who will not only enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardy B and Sean Mendes performances, but will also meet the real purpose of the event – the removal of exceptional poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty project, an international protection group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively struggling with it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (except if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or “actions” as voluntary participation, sending no email to a world leader, telephone call or other connection in order to help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But how successful is the “Global Citizen” 12 years before reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert a genius to be convinced to demand action or is just another case of so-called “klitivism” – people think they are doing something meaningful when they sign online petitions or post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from supporters who insist on many different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders declare commitments and policies amounting to more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and communications resulting from its actions as already paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The group believes that the funds already have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", established in the UK as a partnership between investors and performers, committed to "helping children to develop their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda 35 million dollars to help end the country's malnutrition after they have received more than 4,700 posts on Twitter from "global citizens".
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice into a mere historical note," Ambassador Tracy Ulman told the audience of a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions had been taken that called on Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, "The Power of Nutrition", which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the HRW’s website, asking, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty? ”
"Global citizen" answers: This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail and fail again.
But as with the great movements of civil rights and anti-apartite before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers of this year's New York event, where Deborah-Ley Fernnes and Hugh Jackman will lead.
The United States can use naval forces to "block" and prevent the export of energy - the Minister of the Interior
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering the markets, including the Middle East, reveal US Interior Minister Ryan Zink, according to Washington Examiner.
Zink argues that Russia's engagement in Syria – in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they did in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States, through our naval forces, can ensure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, block them to make sure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink addressed the event, organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is presented as the "vote of energy consumers" in the United States.
He was aiming to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
"The economic option with regard to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, stimulating and replacing fuels," he said, while defining Russia as a 'one-number pony' with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when Trump's administration is tasked with increasing the export of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" pipeline project "North Stream 2", which according to Trump turns Berlin into a "conspirator".
Moscow has stressed several times that the pipeline for US$11 billion of Northern Stream 2, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's burning opposition to the project is simply caused by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the point of view, energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has caused a negative reaction from Germany, which once again confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (DBDI), urged the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kemp, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look" at the 2020 presidential run, says the Massachusetts senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that he would "look seriously" at the presidential run after the mid-term elections.
During city council in Holioke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It is time for women to enter Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will take a serious look at the presidential candidacy."
Warren expressed his judgment regarding President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he "leads this country in the wrong direction.
"I worry about the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was revealed in her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh.
On Twitter Friday, Warren said "of course we need an investigation into the FBI before we vote."
A sociological study conducted on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's voters do not think that it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent supported this candidature.
The sociological study showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the democratic party discussed with regard to potential candidates in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and the senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden said he would make an official decision in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed PTSD at Track Palin at a rally for Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after the entry in September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence Monday night
"What my own son is going through after he returns is known to other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds with which our soldiers are coming home," she told the audience at the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little changed, hardened, back and wonder if they will get that respect that they and their brothers have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Vassila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against women, included in a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in a non-exhaustible state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vassila Police Department.
18 states and district of Colombia support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the district of Colombia are in favour of a new US policy that denies asylum to victims of gang and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from the 18 states and the county applied for goodwill in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge politics, the NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Union for Civil Liberties submitted against federal policy in August, has not been disclosed.
She claims that her partner “and the sons of his gang members” bullied her, but US officials rejected the asylum application on July 20th.
She's being held in Texas.
US lawyers helping Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum candidates come to the United States, as nations facing comprehensive gang and domestic violence problems.
The new US asylum policy brought back the decision of the Immigration Board of Appeal from 2014, which allowed immigrants to apply for asylum if they were fleeing domestic violence.
District attorney Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "has ignored decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be examined according to the specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle," the goodwill report said.
Furthermore, lawyers argue in the report that policies that refuse to enter immigrants are harmful to the American economy, pointing out that it is more likely for them to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
In June, chief prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop providing shelter to victims fleeing domestic harassment and gang violence.
"A refuge is granted to those who leave their home country for the sake of persecution or fear for the sake of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessiones said in its July 11 message on politics.
The refuge was never meant to alleviate all problems – not even all serious ones – that people face every day, anywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palo as deaths double during search for survivors
The situation for survivors is getting harder.
"I feel very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, calming my sick little boy in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance carries more corpses.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save some of their flooded goods.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals injured by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 are overcrowded.
Some of the victims, including Dvi Harris, who suffered a fracture of his spine and shoulder, were placed outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated openly for prolonged secondary shocks.
His eyes are filled with tears when I remember how he felt the severe earthquake in the fifth floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I was pressed into the broken wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that he came to town with his family to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
US envoy accuses China of “bombing” with “propagandising advertisements”
One week after the official newspaper in China launched a four-page advertisement in an American daily for the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid publication in Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of interfering in the November 6th election for the US Congress.
Trump's accusation that Paki was trying to interfere with the U.S. Congress's election, noted what US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to launch commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently participating in an escalating trade war in which they are balancing import tariffs between countries.
According to US and China experts at the beginning of the trade war, Chinese customs tariffs were intended to strike exporters in states like Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the American ambassador to China and Iowa's former long-standing governor, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in a comment in the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, "now doubles this harassment by putting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, China's government takes advantage of America's respected tradition of freedom of speech and the press by launching paid advertising in Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"In contrast, on the newspaper stand down here in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see a real reflection of the various views the Chinese people may have on China's pressing economic trajectory, given that the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He adds that “one of China's most famous newspapers avoided the proposal to publish” his article, although it did not specify who.
With the defeat of Kavano, Republicans reject female voters for mid-term elections, warn analysts
Since many of the high-ranking Republicans stand behind and defend Supreme Court Nominees Bret Kavano in connection with several sexual assault charges, analysts warned that there would be a response, in particular by women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions around these ceilings are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already noted that they wish to continue with the vote.
These things cannot be put back," Grant Raher, professor of political science at Maxwell's University of Syracuse, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
Raher said he doubted whether the last-minute press by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an investigation by the FBI would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or November," Karin Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and National Speaker on the Progressive MoveOn Group, said Friday, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters scandalized "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as Republicans who control the Judicial Commission decided to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded," Stu Rotenberg, a partyless political analyst, told the news.
"People say the problem is already serious; it is true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years, who often do not vote because they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggest that a response may follow if Republicans insist on confirming the application.
"This has become a major mess for the republican party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench. It is the way Republicans deal with it and how they deal with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities, U.S.A., a group that helps to elect a Democrat.
The Americans, however, seem somewhat apart on the question of who to believe in following Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, a little bit more leaning towards the second.
A new sociological study by YouGov shows that 41 percent of those who respond to a certain or probably believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say that they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent say that they believe Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent say the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's claims and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh attacked her in a state of non-exhaustive condition when she was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals in front of her while they were at a party during her follow-up at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Burners-Ley is starting a campaign that aims to compete on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the platform with an open source of Burners-Ley Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company Burners-Ley, he joked that intent behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said with regard to the undertaking.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "online storage of personal data" or SD.

The company calls it ‘the granting of personal data powers’.
The idea of Inrupt, according to Executive Director John Bruce, is that the company invests resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Burners-Ley, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers, concluded a project contract, and a group of programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world have been able to create their decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Ley said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change, or not, when all their business models are completely updated overnight.
"We don't want permission from them."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday Burners-Ley wrote that the Inrupt mission is to provide energy for trade and the ecosystem in order to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the solid basis.
In 1994, Burners-Ley transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
In recent months, Burners-Leigh has had a strong influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Although Inrupt starts, Burners-Ley will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.

Bernard Van: In memory of a priest awarded the cross Victoria during World War I
There are 100 years in the birthplace of the only Anglican priest, honored with Victoria's cross for his participation in hostilities during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 at the Bellenglise and Lehaukourt attack.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without realizing that he was honoured with Britain's highest military honours.
A memorial was discovered Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the monument be discovered exactly 100 years from the work of his grandfather, awarded with a medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin “in a very dense fog and under heavy shelling of artillery and machine guns. ”
Later, he attacked the fire line and with “amazing courage” led me forward before attacking the artillery weapon with one hand and killing three of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never do but make me humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, placed a wreath after the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade.
Michael Van said it is "a great honour for him to participate in the parade" and added "the virtue of the true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine that all night you wait to watch the full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you cannot witness the main event.
The program from San Jose contained 13 matches, including six from the base card and had to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the viewers in Britain were stunned when the transmission changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed when they were built until the early hours, especially because of the fight.
Fan description on Twitter switching to the children's animation film as "a sick joke".
"The government regulates that at 6 p.m. this content is not appropriate, so the programme has been changed by child transmission," said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President for Marketing and Communications of Bellator, in response to a question about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig", yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Koker said he would work on planning the meetings to include the viewers from Britain in the future.
"In my opinion, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Koker said.
"There is, however, six mornings on Sunday and there is no way we can plan things so that the event will take place on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was government.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will stick to the inclusion of five matches instead of six – as we normally do. We tried to make more of ourselves to fans, but we exaggerated.
This is an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt lower because of his sexuality
The Olympic Water Jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling less than everyone else because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started studying in high school, he didn't realize that "not everyone is like me."
In an interview for the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about the rights of gays to give “hope” to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he became less interested in winning the Olympics.
The permanent host of the longtime show, Krusty Young, is in hospital for a few months.
In his first program at Laverne Daily, he said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up, as "you weren't socially acceptable to both girls and boys."
He said: “To this day the sense of undervalue and the fact that I am different from others are in fact things that give me energy and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year's British Community Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he was doing this because he was happy to live openly, without consequences, and wanted to inspire “hope ” of others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "surprised him."
Daley made a marriage with Oscar's host, who was 20 years older than he was last year, but claims that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much while you are so young," he took part for the first time in the Olympic Games at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said, "it is difficult to find someone your age who has experienced such a rise and fall."
The two became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Dale, and Daley himself says that "his entire worldview" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I was only interested in winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily said that his father could not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets to the Olympic Games in London in 2012 – because he wanted to be on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be there for me, Dad, or on the front line," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing and at that moment when I found out he was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invulnerable," he said.
Next year, Daley competes at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that all my life I had dreamed of this – jumping to the Olympic Games in front of the audience at home. There was no more wonderful feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – the “Proud” by Heather Small – which accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still makes him tense.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British Summer Time.
Mikkelson's lost form stays on the Ryder Cup stand Saturday.
American Phil Mikkelson will set a record on Sunday when he's playing his 47th game at Ryder Coop, but he'll have to return his old form if he doesn't want his record to be tied to failure.
Mikkelson, who took part in the two-year event for the record 12th time, was left on the bench by Captain Jim Furik for "Fourball" and "Fours" matches on Saturday.
Instead of being the leading figure of the US team again, the five-time winner of major tournaments spent his day as a fan and in training his blows from a distance with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who even at the top of his career was never among the straightest players, is not in the optimal form of the Le Golf National difficult playground, where the long uneven terrain usually punishes every wrong blow.
And if the playground itself isn't disturbing enough, on Sunday's ninth game, Mikkelson will stand up against British Open Francesco Molinari's precise champion, who's on the team with new recruit Tommy Fleetwood, trying to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are behind four points before the 12th singles game make a strong start, it may prove that Michelangelo's match is absolutely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his compatriot, although he could hardly say anything much different.
"He fully understood his role today, beat me back, hug me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He is confident of himself.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame and he's given so much both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing just two games.
I expected him to play more, but it just worked out, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else."
Mikkelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for the biggest game in Ryder Coop, played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career in Ryder Coop, which had never been close to his impressive individual achievements.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 loses and seven equals matches, but Furik said his presence brings other benefits to the team that are not measured by numbers.
"He is funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with people and is a great person for every team," he explained.
"I think the younger players have had fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than that just to play."
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great advantage can soon be melted
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the great advantage accumulated before the single matches of the last day of Ryder Coop can easily be erased.
The Danish debuted in the Valderrama game in 1997 when the team with Captain Sve Ballisteros led five points in front of the Americans, but it was almost at the final rights and barely managed to hold the 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead on "Valderrama"; we also had a great lead on "Brookline", where we lost, and at "Valderrama" we won, but very hard," Bjorn said, after the team of Europe from 2018 won 5-3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, leading with 10-6 on "Le Golf National:".
So the story has to show both me and everyone on the team that it's not all over.
Be ready to attack tomorrow.
Come out and do what you have to do.
Nothing's over until you see the final score on the board.
We have a goal and it's to try to win this trophy, and that's exactly what we need to stay focused on.
All the time, I've been saying that I only think about the 12 players on our team, but we're also aware of our rivals, who are the greatest players in the world."
Satisfied by the performance of the players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never rush the celebrations.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow will come out individual performances, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you get out alone, then you put your entire capacity as a golfer to the test.
This is the message that has to get to the players: tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he must be distributed to the end."
Unlike Bjorn, the captain of the rival Jim Furik will want his players to present themselves better individually than as partners, such as Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four possible points.
Furik himself was on both sides of those large reverses on the last day – he was part of the Brookline triumph, and then he was on the losing side when the Europeans performed the "The miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, took his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but it would be good to do the same good start as you saw at the Brookline as well as at the Medinah.
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these interim matches play under tremendous pressure.
That's why we formed our composition and distributed our boys the way we want to try to do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with leading our counterattack and facing Rory McElroy in the most important game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Polter will meet the other Europeans in the upper half of the arrangement.
"I chose these players in this order because I think it gives us the best chance of success," Bjorn said about his choice for singles.
Germany is once again delaying the deployment of a new warship
The latest frigate of the German fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the older warships of the Cold War, but this would not take place until at least next year due to the failing systems and skyrocketing costs reported by local media.
The introduction into operation of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading brand ship of new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, who quoted an army spokesman.
The swimming court had to join the naval forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuertemberg class ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the aged Fregates of the Bremen class.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, e.g. reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest frigates must be able to be used for up to two years before returning to the ports of home.
However, continuous delays mean that the vanguarded warships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power beyond the ocean – will be old when they enter operation, Die Zeit noted.
The evil frigate F125 entered the headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to release the vessel into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet is returning the ship to the ship after delivery.
It is little known about the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of significant “software and hardware defects” that make the warship useless if sent to a war mission.
Software failures are particularly important as Baden-Wuertemberg class vessels will be managed by crews of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older frigates of the Bremen class.
In addition, the ship has been significantly overloaded, reducing its effectiveness and limiting the possibility of the naval forces to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is considered twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project – including training the crew – also becomes a problem.
It is believed to have reached the stunning 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) – from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the newest frigates become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet "is actually exhausted from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said the problem had become bigger in time, as the old ships were out of operation, but no new ones were provided.
He complained that no frigate from Baden-Wuertemberg class could be included in the fleet.
The National Trust follows the secret life of bats
A new study carried out in a mansion in the Scottish mountains aims to determine how bats use landscapes when hunting.
Hopes are that discoveries will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow the common bats, as well as brown arrowheads in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key sites in the property to track the activities of the bats during the season.
NHS and volunteers will also carry out mobile tests using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the call sounds of bats, as well as which species issue them.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Duar, a nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the work on habitat management, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and Britain have generally decreased significantly in the past century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their asylum and lead to habitat loss.
The risk to the population may include wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and certain chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles to their flight trajectory.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The Trust has trained experts who conduct regular surveys, inspections of asylum and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first in Scotland and the only special bat reserve in the House of Three in the Dumfries and Galway area, home of eight of the ten bats in Scotland.
The head of the David Thompson estate says it's the perfect territory for them.
"Here in Three, we have a great terrain for bats," he noted.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and completed a suitable habitat.
But there are many more things about bats that are not known, so the work that we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to flourish."
He stressed that it was important to verify the presence of bats before maintenance activities were carried out, as it was possible that the involuntary destruction of one asylum would kill up to 400 female and young bats, as well as destroy the entire local population.
Blinds are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee in the Bat Protection Trust, encouraged the community to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our animal species, because we just don’t know what happens to their populations. ”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape and his lawyers will sue a German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo made allegations of rape against him as “false news, ” saying that people“ want to become famous, ” using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
Portugal and Juventus' attacker was accused of raping American Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claimed that after that he paid her $375 000 to silence the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In the Instagram video, addressing its 142 million followers, several hours after the release of the 33-year-old Ronaldo slandered the publication as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is false news," the five-time Golden Ball bearer said in front of the camera.
"They want to become famous using my name.
That's normal.
They want to get popular on my back, but that's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything's fine," the football player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for claims that call "unacceptable publication of suspicions in the field of personal life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the football player would seek compensation for "moral damage in proportion to the gravity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident was claimed to have occurred in June 2009 in an apartment in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the football player's room, where it was said that he raped her annally, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her that he was a “good boy” of “99 per cent”, but in the case he simply surrendered to “the only percentage. ”
According to the papers, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but this happened with her consent.
Majorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries to the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court agreement because she felt "scarred of revenge" and worried that she would not "be publicly humiliated".
A 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident in question.
At the time of the incident Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid of Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian Grand Juventus for the amount of 100m euros.
Brekzit: UK “will regret forever” that it has lost its car manufacturers
Britain will "sorry forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brakzit, said business secretary Greg Clarke.
He added that it was “unsettling” that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at their plant in Bournaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
Japan's car manufacturer said that the impact of the delay on the border in the case of Brexit without a deal could lead to job losses.
In the factory in Bournaston, where the Auris and Avensis models are produced, nearly 150,000 cars were manufactured last year, 90% of which are exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain comes out of the EU in late March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bournaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and about how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says they'll close their factory for the Mini model in Oxford for a month after Braxit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are the risks to the supply chain in the cases of Brexit without a deal.
Toyota's production line works on the principle of "timely" as the parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both from Britain and the EU for custom-made cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there may be problems at the border, which according to industry can lead to delays and shortages of parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to wait more than a day for them to fill their inventory at the Darbisher factory, they said from the company, and that's why the production will stop.
Mr Clark said Teresa May's "shakhmat" plan for a future relationship with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to grab this opportunity," he said in programme 4's Today of BBC Radio.
"After Toyota's claims, but also for other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to provide successful supply chains."
By Toyota they cannot tell how long production will be stopped, but in the longer term they warn that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsavalis, who has worked in Bournaston for 24 years and has been the founder of the Union of Unity in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “I have tried to believe that if these jobs go away, they will never return.
The government spokesman said, "We have set out an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled for another week", as the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavano continued, the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's interference in the elections, the links between Trump and Russia's assistants and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy chief prosecutor or not, he'll jeopardize Mueller's independence for months to feed the rumors about Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the President through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denies that claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was in the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting with him was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "want not to" fired Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the hearing before the Senate legal committee, which both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI of the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Sunday on Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It can be this week, but seeing all the other things happening in the Supreme Court, I think it can be postponed for next week.
But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would contest this claim: Sanders did not hold a White House press conference on September 10th.
The chairman of the show, Chris Wallace, asked about the cause.
Sanders replied that the rare press conferences were not because of animosity with television journalists' "demonstrative behaviour", although he said, "I can't say I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrated behavior."
Then she implied that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President conducts more sessions with questions and answers from each president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence: "We checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continues, but "if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, this is far better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this often and you are witnesses to practice it quite often in recent weeks, and it will replace press conferences once you have the opportunity to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with visiting seniors.
Self-conference is rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and at times strange behavior in front of the journalists gathered.
Minister of Health addressed EU workers to the National Health Service of Scotland in relation to the fears related to Brexit
The Minister of Health addressed in writing to EU staff working in the National Health Service of Scotland to express the country's appreciation and the desire for them to remain in their post-Brekzit posts.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to the remaining less than six months until Britain's EU exit.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to the costs of established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer the negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving continued, with decisions expected in this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in preparing for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain period for all of you.
So I would like to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond contribute with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is beneficial for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we would very much like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after he had a head injury.
Tennessy State Tigers' linebacker, Christian Abercrombie, suffered an emergency operation after receiving head trauma during Saturday's meeting when his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores at 31-27, said Mike Organi of Tennessee.
Tennessy State's senior coach, Rod Reid, shared with reporters that the trauma occurred just before the halftime.
"He went to the sideline and somehow just fainted there," Reid said.
Coaches and medics put oxygen on the Abercrombie sideline before it was placed on the stretcher and taken to the locker room for further examination.
Tennessee State's official confirmed to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details of the type/seriousness of the trauma yet, ” and that Tennessee State is trying to understand when the trauma occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-grader with a college scholarship, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blockades before leaving the game, making a total of 18 blockades for him during this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher Herb Tax when purchasing real estate in the UK
According to the new plans of the conservatives, foreign buyers will be charged a higher Herb tax when purchasing real estate in Britain, and additional funds will help the homeless.
This move will neutralize Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the Herb Tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The state Treasury expects an increase of more than 120 million British pounds per year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today the decision that foreign buyers will pay a higher Herb tax when purchasing real estate in Britain, with additional revenues going to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
An increase in the Herb tax will affect individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in Britain, with additional revenues helping the government to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is an addition to the current Herb tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second dwellings and properties purchased for the purpose of award – may amount to up to three percent.
The state Treasury expects the revenues to rise by up to 120 million British pounds a year.
About 13% of newly built buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the UK, leading to price increases and making it difficult for people who buy property for the first time to interfere in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “spiritual cities”, due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy only appears a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the herb tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by looting the land, but did not use it, and asked Mrs May to leave the quotas for affordable housing to repair the UK's "warning" housing.
Mr Corbin announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reform, including control of rents and an end to the "no faults" expulsion.
He also wishes to give the council greater powers to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said that I would like to devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream – the life of every new generation to be better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be with open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for people who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, to buy as easily housing as the hardworking British residents.
For too many people the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the resentment of sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish team."
Sanderland's manager, Jack Ross, said that "the biggest ambition" in his career is to be a senior coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman accepted the challenge of reviving the club from northeast England, which is currently in third position in the First League, on three points from the first place.
He passed on Stadiam uff Light this summer after St. Meernon took off last season back to the Scottish Higher League.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I wrote down a game for the B team, and that was all," Ross told Scottish BBC Sportssound.
“But I grew up with Scotland’s Hempden matches, which my father and I watched as a child, so that I was always attracted to the national team.
"This opportunity, however, would only open if I had success at the club level."
The predecessors of Ross as Sanderland's managers include names such as Dick Advocate, David Moose, Sam Alardeis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloa Atletik's former mentor said he was not disturbed as a successor to such well-established names in a similar famous club, and he had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, success will now be measured with a positive answer to the question "Can I return this club to the League?"
Because by structure, base and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the Supreme League," he said.
"It won't be easy to go back to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross has only been a manager for three years since he spent some time as an assistant at Dhambarton and 15 months at Harts' training staff.
Then he helped Alois not to fall into the Third Division and turn St. Meereen from a winning team into a champion in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his football career in Clyde, Hartlipul, Folker, St. Miran and Hamilton Academy.
"I was really at the crossroads," he remembers the time he took Alois.
"I really believed that being a manager was the best thing for me, including being an active player.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, making good money, and I had some significant successes.
But being a player is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still facing the same levels of stress and stress at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I really do, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin in my entire conscious life."

The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals research
Summer heat increased the income of the struggling to survive British pubs, but gained more tension for the chain restaurants.
Groups of pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, statistics show.
Peter Martin of the Business Consultant CGA, who compiled statistics, said: “Because of the prolonged solar time and longer than England’s expected participation in the World Cup, in July a similar model follows, as the pubs reported growth by 2.8%, but the restaurants received an even stronger impact.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
The pubs and drinks bars reported the best results in their height compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
The feeding pubs also suffered from the solar weather, but not as much as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks jumped 6.6 per cent per month, while food decreased by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, of the RSM leisure and entertainment analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we saw in late April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to selling in the services sector outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a fall in sales with 4.8 per cent per year on an annual basis can be particularly painful in addition to permanent costs.
The long hot summer could not appear at a worse time for food managers and only time would show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August would bring the desired rest."
The total growth in pub and restaurant sales, including the new ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the delay in the decomposition of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales analyst in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over 9 billion British pounds, and is an established indicator in the industry.
One in five kids hides a secret profile from his parents in a social network
One in five children – some only 11 – has a secret profile in a social network that hides from its parents and teachers, revealed a study
A study conducted among 20,000 high school students shows the growth of fake Insta pages
News has raised fears that sexual material is published
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "core" profile that showed their parents
One out of five children – some one in 11 – creates a profile in a social network that keeps the elderly secret.
A survey of 20,000 high school students shows growth in fake Insta accounts – a link to Instagram photo sharing site.
News has raised fears that material with sexual content is published.
Twenty per cent of the students said they had a clean "core" profile that showed their parents, while they also had secret profiles.
A mother who came across a secret site on her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenage child that encouraged others to "rape him".
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools found that 40 per cent of children between 11 and 18 years have two profiles, half of whom admit that they keep their profiles secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It’s so disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them. ”
AIID DOYLE WILL BE "THE VOICE OF THE ATTITUDE" ON THE BOARD OF FRENCH ATLETICS IN STOTLAND
AIID DOYLE was selected to join the Board of Athletics in Scotland as Director without the executive function of the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's best-performing minor, and President Ian Bietti has identified this move as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead in sports to take advantage of its rich experience at an international level in the last decade.
"Elid enjoys great respect in the athletic communities of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that the lightweight athlete in Scotland will benefit greatly by attracting her," Betty said.
Doyle said: “I want to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help promote sports in Scotland. ”
The American who won the finals at 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, adding to his four total Olympic gold medals, is currently a regular commentator at the BBC, losing his ability to walk after receiving a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I was struck.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell me if I would recover and to what extent.
It was a exhausting job, but I achieved a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing mobility training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Feed pump advertising that compares mothers with cows, separates online opinions
A company producing breast-feeding pumps has shared online ads that compare breast-feeding mothers with cows that are breast-feeding.
To mark the placing on the market of the expected "first silent pump for breast-feeding in the world suitable for wear", the user technology company Elvie released a joke musical-video commercial to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides to breast-feeding women to express themselves.
Four real mothers dance in a haystack, in the background of a song with a text including, "Yes, I suck, but you don't see any tail" and, "If you haven't noticed, it's not a serpent, it's my breasts."
The proverb continues: “Push out, pump out, feed the babies with them, pump out, pump out, suck up your friends. ”
However, the advertisement, published on the company’s Facebook page, caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying it detracts from the “scares” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a stupid decision to use cows for advertising on this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them away a few days after birth," someone wrote.
Elvie feed pump is collected discreetly in breast-fed bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is totally understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added, "Such inadequate advertising."
Others defended the ad, admitting that the song was "extremely funny".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breast-feeding.
The draining made me feel exactly like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I take it as it is.
This product is genius," someone wrote.
Another comment: “It’s a funny commercial directed at mothers who squeeze (often at their jobs or in toilets) and feel like ‘ cows. ’
This is not a commercial that praises or condemns the milk processing industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced with discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The idea of the campaign is based on seeing that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or pipes and gathers discreetly in a bra for infants, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies and even go outside while they drain.
Ana Balarin, partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative market entry.
With the drawing of a parallel between suckling cows and dairy cows, we wanted to focus our attention on the suckling of breast milk and all the challenges involved, while at the same time showing a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that will bring the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump got into the lead news.
During the Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the dance floor for designer Martha Yakobovski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly transferred to tent camp at the Texas border
The number of children detained by migrants jumped sharply, although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policy by Trump's administration made it difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Usually most guardians are immigrants without documents who are afraid of risking their stay in the country if they wish to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults in the family should provide fingerprints, and these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had no previous criminal records.
"Nearly 80 per cent of those who are either guardians or members of the guardians' family are illegally staying in the country, most of whom are criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these persons," Albens said.
In their quest to deal faster with the registration of these children, authorities have imposed new rules that require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as was the previous rule, according to the staff at the shelter.
Many appear in a video conference conversation, not personally, to present their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are identified as unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children remain detained, the more likely it is to become depressed or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter officials and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child has problems are more likely to be neglected because of the scale of the place.
They added that moving children to the “palatkova” city without having enough time to prepare themselves at an emotional level or to say goodbye to their friends can make the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has lasted for eight years.
Mualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign troops are illegally staying on Syrian land under the pretext of combating terrorism and "to which they will be taken".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without condition," he said at the meeting.
Mualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions are forcibly displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight in this holy battle until all Syrian lands are cleansed" both from terrorist organizations and from "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian elements, the opposition of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the lands devastated by the war country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said the conditions were tolerable and could be returned, accusing "some Western countries of "emotion of baseless fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to cooperate on these returns," he said.
"They are turning into a political issue something that is a completely humanitarian issue."
The US and the European Union have warned that assistance will not be provided for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to stop the war.
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large rebel fortress in Idlib provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a widespread attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces against the province, where three million people live.
Mualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed to the jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda front "Al Nusra" that would "be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of the new committee, composed of members of the government and opposition, to draft Syria's post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Mualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to a "review of the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump Wins a Second Mandate
By this logic Trump will win the election re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberals hope, his presidency is not terminated prematurely because of impeachment and scandal.
That would no doubt be the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!
At the moment, there are no signs of the weariness of the viewers.
Since 2014, the premium rating has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly three times to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during Primetime, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC is on top of the cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers on evenings with big news.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it is something we don't understand," says Neil Baer, executive producer of the ABC drama "Last Candidate", where he talks about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skovel, who is a veteran screenwriter and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, “Why? ”
Mrs. Skovel told me that he answered her, "Because she makes me laugh."
There's fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else that is shown on television, going out of Washington history can determine the future of Row vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Nevertheless, the desire to inform a citizen does not correspond to that at six hours to watch as a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source of his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's pilot jacket from a throng of $15,000 (“dreaming with arrogance” according to the “Washington Post”), and the shocking descriptions of Stormy Daniels about Mr Trump's anatomy.
I especially will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"It is an honor of what he does to make you feel like part of a reality show, to give you a little bit every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, with regard to changing players and day-to-day turnouts (mending with the National Football League, praising Kim Chen Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be behind.
When I contacted Mr. Flyce this week, he had a sunny, 80-degree sunscreen on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked up at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, especially when Brett Kavanaugh had to face the Senate's legal committee, and it depended on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flyce told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Investments invest in the most disputed race in early elections for a seat in Congress
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives a flow of money thanks to the reordering of the district of Congress and from there two titles for the same place.
The recently redistributed county in Pittsburgh's suburbs points to conservative Democrat Connor Lamb, who won his place from another county in a partial election last spring.
Lamb faces another titler, the Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly in favour of the new 17th.
The maps were drawn again after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ordered in January that the old districts were anti-constitutionally manipulated in favour of Republicans.
The event in the new 17th district broke up a financial dispute between the main financing institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congress Committee on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb was famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely discussed partial elections in March for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The position was taken by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won a 20-point district.
Political experts believe that Democrats have little advantage.
The United States considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, then withdrew
The diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already acknowledged Beijing, with a little pressure from Washington.
Mr Trump had a heart-to-heart meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the Trump Organization management team.
Representatives of the State Department decided to call off the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the Department earlier this month, said.
But sanctions were envisaged only against El Salvador, who in 2017 received about $140 million of US aid for the fight against drugs, with a view to development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be excruciating for the state of Central America with its unemployment and the rate of killings.
With the progress of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which serves to extend such gathering last year, viewed as a step forward in efforts to prevent the influx from migrants to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior management authorities had specified that their desire was to hold the conference, thus effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pens has now announced that he will participate in a conference planned for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the assembly, diplomats say.
And the three US MPs came back quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new severe communications or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined a comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who wished to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also wished to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next move may be the report of Special Adviser Robert Muller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, as the report is currently a significant evidence in the public register.
Mr. Muller is alleged to be directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump has conspired with Russia during his campaign in their attack against our elections.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will appear that Mr Trump will have to report to this body when he is preparing to stand before the voters, as well as perhaps to the jury composed of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – nor is that of the likes of him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, have to make these choices that will affect how long the fight will extend.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler, as long as the West had stood up to him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years that followed on the slaughter.
The course of history depends on such milestones, and the relentless march of democracy slows or slows down.
At the moment, Americans are facing a number of similar conditions.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds Mr. Muller's case in hand?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that last year he has proposed secretly writing down the president and speculating that he is not suitable for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein has announced that the history of the Times is incorrect.
"How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Kavanaugh, sought by the FBI, is not complete or fair - or if it is approved for the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the early elections for Congress if it forces Mr Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these trials, democracy awaits it for a long winter.
But I believe we won't fail because I took a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the candles for Shabat on that table, carrying swastika.
With an inheritance like that, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, Senior Associate of the Brookings Institute, is president of "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington", and is the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House."
Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the run-in with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers are hosting the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and they are aware that winning the Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to move forward with the G Group of the League of Europe.
Contusion in the knee did not allow semi-protector Graham Dorans to play his first match for the season before the equality 2-2 with Villareal was concerned, but he believes that for Rangers this result could become a trampoline to greater achievements.
"We have won an important point because Villareal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old football player said.
"We went into the game with the hope that we could win something and left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the match, but overall equality seems a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
We took a look at Thursday, another big night from our games in Europe.
I hope that we can fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match because they have achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can do our best and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely hard after everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now things seem to have gone in the right direction.
The team is good and the boys are really having fun, the workouts are beneficial.
I hope we can harness all our strength to forget last season and achieve the desired success."
Women worry about fears about their retirement savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what care they wanted to receive, few people are discussing this with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they discussed with their husbands the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to look after them, but they have not taken steps to hold this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Life Insurance Sector.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Together with your adviser and your family, discuss where and how you want to receive care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Include your financial adviser: Your adviser can also help you with an idea of how to pay these expenses.
Your decisions, when you select a financial institution for long-term care, may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with monetary value to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your funds – if you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with the legal battles at the beginning.
Assign a health care officer so that you have a certain trustee who will oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also the idea of a financial officer.
You can select a trusted person to take the financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the minor details: Imagine that your adult parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Put these details in writing so that you are ready.
"It is not only about the financial aspect, but also about who the doctors will be," Martin asked.
"How are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan."

Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palou on Friday, the authorities announced that the number of dead is expected to rise.
Due to severe communications, aid organisations are unable to obtain information from the Dongala Regent, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated to Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palo and Dongala, which are located on Sulavesi Island:
Palou is the capital of central Sulavesi Province, located at the end of a narrow beach on the west coast of Sulavesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami swept over it.
Dongala is a regency stretching more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline of Sulavesi Island.
The Agency, which is smaller than the province, has an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundation of the economy of central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
The prize of nickel is also important for the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Palou and Dongala have been high several times since the tsunami in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Recovery Agency.
In 1938, Tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Tsunami struck the western part of Dongala and in 1996 when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located on the seismic “Pacific Fire Ring” and is regularly crushed by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and waves of tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on December 26th on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra triggered a wave of tsunamis that swept 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Rabbit with a Magnitude 6.8 maimed the most populated island in Indonesia, Java, by activating tsunamis that crashed on the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Magnitude earthquake 7.6 struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 cut one of the islands of Mentaway and triggered a 10-meter wave of tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Pidi Jaya Regent in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time no tsunamis are activated, but more than 100 people were killed by wrecked buildings.
2018: Strong rabbits mutilated the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killed more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Paylin's biggest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Trak Paylin, the biggest son of the former Alaskan governor and vice president candidate Sarah Paylin, was arrested on violence charges.
Paylin, a 29-year-old from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in reporting domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report by the US police in Alaska, published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Peilin was detained in the Mat-Su pre-detainment building and under an unsecured guarantee of $500, KTOU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself “innocent, certainly” when asked for a plea, reports the media.
Peilin is threatened with three Class A advances, which means he can be deprived of liberty for up to a year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He's also accused of trespassing from Class B, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Peilin's been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017 he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Payin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being considered by the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of drug addicts in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he punched her in the face with a fist.
Sarah Paylin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son's aggressive behavior with post-traumatic stress arising from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed by an earthquake that cut down the Indonesian island of Sulavezi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications networks are cut off, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulavezi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
In social networks, videos are spinning that show the moment of collision.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu, when the tsunami wave was overflew by the coast.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death sentence for a terrorist suspect in New York City
Federal prosecutors from New York want the death penalty for Saifolo Saip, the suspected terrorist assassination in New York City, in which eight people were killed — a rare punishment that has not been executed in federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is said to have used a truck to rent Home Depot to carry out the attack in October on the Veloway near the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, foot walkers and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to a notification of intent in connection with the death penalty claim filed in South York.
According to the court document, both charges could end with a death sentence.
Weeks after the assassination, an expanded federal judiciary sent 22 counts to Saip's indictment, including eight charges of racket-related murder used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of the IPU.
The attack required "serious planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing the way Saip carried out as "serious, cruel and perverse".
"Sifulo Habibulajevich Saip caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, An-Lory Dekad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erley, Hernan Fellucci and Alejandro Damian Panuco," the notification said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last South of New York City has been looking for a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two narcos, but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence in a federal case was executed in New York City was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a sentence of conspiracy and spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek by nationality, showed no remorse during the days and months following the assassination, according to the court's documents.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIL on his phone, the prosecution said.
He also asked his hospital room to place the flag of ISIS, the police said.
He pleads innocent on the indictment, consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutor's decision.
"In our view, the decision to seek a death sentence instead of taking a sentence for guilty and life imprisonment without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events on all affected," Patton said.
The Saipov Defence Team had previously asked the D.A. not to want a death sentence.
A member of parliament from the conservatives says that Nigel Farajj should lead the talks on Brekzit
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilise the army of the people" today, during a protest at the conference of conservatives.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said that politicians should "feel the pressure" – one of Teresa May's own party suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonn, a conservative MP, said in Birmingham in March that Britain "would have been out by now" if Mr Farage was the secretary for Brekzit's questions.
But the challenge faced by Ms. May to deal with the party's deeply divided ranks was highlighted by conservatives who supported the stay that joined a separate protest against Brekzit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan "Chequers", despite attacks by supporters Brekzit, supporting the EU's stay.
The allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and insist that Eurosceptics and Labour choose between its package and the "haos".
Mr. Bonn told the protestors with the slogan "Going out means going out" in Solihel that he wanted to "put away Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr Farage had to participate equally with the others and that he had to be held responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we would have left by now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan.
Saying his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be oblivious.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bonn rejected the allegations that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The perception that the British have changed their mind and want to remain is entirely wrong.”
The conservative representative Andrea Jenkins also took part in the rally, saying to reporters: “I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists who have actually gone out on the street and have really helped us be elected.
Please dump "Chequers" and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs. May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their position when they keep their promises. ”
Mr Farage said at the rally that politicians should "feel pressure" if they intend to change the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to change Brakzit and we're gathered here today to say, 'We won't let you get away with this.'"
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to get our political class, which is on the verge of changing Braxit, to feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which has helped us to win Brekzit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, the supporters of the stay made a march through Birmingham before conducting a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists have raised flags with signs of “Conservators Against Brexit” following the start of the group this weekend.
Liberist Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues of the party's application when he opened at the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can deploy the IT systems and all technology of Canada and more, and more, for the smooth crossing of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a complete farce.
There's no such thing as a good Braxit," he added.
Warren said he would "think seriously" his candidacy for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that he would "consider seriously the possibility of running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that the representative of the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future during the city council in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a constant critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against the US representative of Republicans, Jeff Deil, who was joint chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She is at the centre of speculation that she can take Trump's position in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holioke was her 36th meeting with voters in the City Hall after Trump's entry into office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it was high time for "women to go to Washington and fix our damaged government, and that included women at the top".
He was arrested for Simms' death in LSU.
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was an arrest suspect in Friday's shooting when basketball player Wade Sims of LSU was killed.
Baton Rouge's police department reported Dayton Simpson's arrest at a press conference at 1 1 1:00 Eastern time.
They posted a video from the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man who was seen on the footage.
Simms, a 20-year-old, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
"Wade Simms was shot in the head, which eventually leads to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the crime scene, had a gun, and shot Wade Simms.
Simpson has been arrested without hindrance and detained in the arrest of the Eastern Baton Rouge Police Department.
A youth with a height of 6′6′′ grew up in Baton Rouge – Simms participated in 32 matches with 10 dates as the title of last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 matches.
Gran Prim Russia: Luis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after instructions from his team helped defeat Sebastian Fetel
Since Walter Botas was ranked ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the instructions of the Mercedes team will play an important role in the race.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously disturbed Hamilton while defending his position in the first two turns, allowing Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fethel first made a pit stop and let Hamilton deal with the traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next tour and came out after Fetel, but Hamilton managed to outrun it after bold maneuvering and driving a tire to the wheel, which forced Ferrari's pilot reluctant to release the inside of the track to avoid punishment with added time after he had already closed the way of his opponent with a dangerous double protection maneuver at the third turn.
On top of her 21st birthday, Max Verstapin started from the back rows of the start grid and was seventh after the end of the first lap.
After that he even led through a rather long period of competition, because he had decided to change his tires later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and eventually beat Kim Rikonen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally he entered for a pit-foot in the 44th lap, but failed to catch up enough in the next eight laps and eventually Riconen finished fourth.
It was a tough day, because Walter did a great job all weekend and he turned out to be a real gentleman when he let me beat him.
The team did an extraordinary job to win the first two seats on the podium," Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made a mockery of Senator Diane Finestein's rally on Saturday because of her claim that she did not distribute the letter from Christine Blazey Ford, which accuses the contender of Brett Cavanaugh's Supreme Court for sexual assault.
During a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the statements given by Ford to the Senate's legal committee, but instead commented on how what happened in the Senate shows that people are "evil and repulsive and dishonest".
"What can happen to the good that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil, and repugnant, and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at publications and distribution, and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you spread out?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document, “Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... no, we didn't spread," he added, imitating the senator.
Fainstein sent a letter detailing Ford's claims against Kavanaugh in July, and it was circulated earlier in September – but Fainstein denied that this distribution had happened from her office.
"I haven't covered up Ford's claims, I haven't spread her story," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep my privacy, and I kept my privacy as she wished."
But her denial was not well accepted by the president, who commented during the rally Saturday night: “I will tell you that this was a very bad language of the body.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court contender, accused of sexual crimes against three women, the president said that Democrats are using claims for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power with all possible means.
See the disgrace, the shamelessness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to regain their power and control," the president said, according to Mediaite.
Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duyer scored two goals for Jayentes against Dundee.
Dundy Stars went back to their Friday loss at the Elite League against Belfast Giants, winning a rematch at Dundy with 5-3 on Saturday.
Jayentes was taken early to the game with two goals after hitting Patrick Duyre and Francis Bovilleier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kauni settled for the housewives before Duyer regained Jayants' head start.
Francois Bushar leveled for Dundee before the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen confirmed their victory.
This is the third victory in the Elite League for the boys of Adam Keefe who got out of the bottom to beat Dundee in Belfast on 2-1 Friday night.
This was the fourth confrontation between the opponents this season, as Jajonts won the last three games.
The blow, with which Duaire discovered the result, came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with Kendall McFaul's assistance, and then David Rutherford doubled the advance by assisting Bovilleer four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan returned the hosts back in the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped settle with the help of Kauni at 15:16.
Duyer tried to take Jayants before the first break, marking the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts have regrouped and Bushar again leveled the odds with a powerful blow at the door at 27:37.
Kauni and Charles Corcoran united their efforts to help Nielsen give Dundy the lead for the first time at the end of the second half, by giving everything to himself and fortifying the team's victory with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
Giants, who lost the last four games of a total of five meetings, are welcome as hosts of Milton Keynes for their next match on Friday.
The flight manager died to make sure that hundreds of people aboard the plane could escape an earthquake.
The leader of flights to Indonesia was praised as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane of hundreds of passengers on board managed to fly safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many are unknown in a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Sulavezi on Friday, triggering a wave of tsunamis.
Strong secondary quakes continued to destroy the area and many were caught trapped in the ruins of the city of Palou.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufrey Airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway at that time, would be able to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided to crash.
Later he died in the hospital.
The air control spokesman, Indonesia, Johannes Sirajt, said that this decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balakpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palou.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about this," he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency has announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Siggy and Butong is limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will increase as many bodies are still under the debris and many people cannot be reached," the spokesman for Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached six meters have devastated Palu, where a mass burial took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, the ambulance brings more bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
There's looting all over the minimarkets."
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, pointed out to CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is struggling to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy now, but it could get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Wiidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's army: "Please work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reports that a man is in the dark after a plane crash in a lagoon
The plane that flew a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean now reports that a man was reported missing after saying earlier that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that they could not contact a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline added that they work together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Local people's boats helped save the passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuk Island.
On Friday, the authorities said seven people were admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were left at the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airlines and the US Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims the plane entered very low.
"This is extremely nice," says Jane.
Jane tells us that he and the others were able to run through the deep water to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He shared that the stewardess had panicked and shouted, and that he had suffered a slight head trauma.
U.S. Navy tells us that sailors repairing the harbor nearby also helped in the rescue operation by using an inflatable boat to get people to shore before the plane sinks into the deep about 30 meters of water (100 feet).
Data from the Safety Network indicate that over the past two decades 111 people have died in flights with planes registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
Analyst exposes chronology to the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution closed its case this Saturday in a retrial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulet of the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to assemble the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Roulette said he received data on the location of several cell phones showing that Telis was with Chambers the night of her death, back to his previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford stood trial on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Telis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that "this is a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is that Telis said he knew Chambers two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other for a week.
Roulet pointed out that shortly after Chambers Tellis' death, he deleted text messages, calls, and her contact information from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin with its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be presented to the jury later on that day.

Another black man?!
New York nanny sues couple after firing for a racist message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for dismissal for discrimination after receiving a false message from the mother who complains that she is the "other black woman".
The couple deny that they are racist, like a extortion demand.
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was giddy when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEE, ANOTHER BLACKWAY”, Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending him to her husband, however, she sent him to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs Plasco-Flaxman’s “uncomfortable” fired Mrs Morris, pointing out that the former nanny, who was an Afro-American, was not doing her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino, reported New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was rewarded for a working day then sent home by taxi.
Now Morris is suing the couple for compensation because of the dismissal, asking for the amount of $350 a day for the six-month contract for which she was initially hired, even though she did not have a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do that," she told the Post Friday, adding, "I'm sure this is discrimination."
In response to the request, the couple claimed that they were not racist, adding that the termination of Maurice's employment was a reasonable act, as they feared that they could not trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco told the Postman.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have offended, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
Plasco claims that his wife gave birth only two months ago and was in “a very difficult situation. ”
"Will you attack someone in this state?
This is not particularly nice," the investment banker added.
While the trial is still under way, public opinion quickly condemns the couple in social networks by disproving them for their conduct and their logic.
Padington’s publishers feared that readers would have no connection to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the audience, tells of the letter: “It is hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It's so much fun now that we're aware of Paddington's great success."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC, before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little bear toy, would feel optimistic about the possible rejection of the book, adding that he welcomed the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book “with mixed feelings” after his death last year.
With regard to Paddington, whom she described as “an important member of our family, ” she added that her father secretly felt proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a very modest man and he was not ungrateful," she said.
“But since Paddington felt so real, it’s like having a child that has accomplished something: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not really your job.
I think he kind of took Paddington's success this way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors struggled in vain to save her life.
"Nad kept calling to say that the situation was really bad, that she did not expect to survive," Mrs Edin-Laperuz said.
"After that, Nad called me to say that he would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I told her, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given to her by the doctors to maintain her heart slowly cease to function and leave her system.
She's gone a while before that, and that way it's all over.
I had to just sit there and wait, realizing that all of this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
The cold had to be tightened up."
Finally, Mrs. Edin-Laperuz, who has so far mourned her daughter's loss, embarks on the plane along with other passengers who have no idea of the test she's going through.
"Nobody understood," she said.
"I was putting my head in and all the time my tears were dripping.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt this insatiable sense of compassion with Over.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Grief women put cards to prevent suicides from the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones for suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she says.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old from Lidney, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everybody knew him by the smile.
They always said his smile lit up every room."
However, he gave up his work before leaving, and he was in “a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he had taken his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that this will have consequences. ”
Mrs. Davis creates the cards “to let people know that they have someone to go to and someone to talk to, even if they are friends.
Do not remain silent – you must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's, lost Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He did not share that he felt depressed or depressed or anything else," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when children opened their gifts, he neither looked at them nor anything."
She said that this was a terrible trauma to them, but they had to cope: “This opens up a void in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to move forward and fight."
If you are struggling to cope, you can contact the Samaritans at 116 123 (for Britain and Ireland), free of charge, send an email to jo@samaritans.org or visit the Samaritan site here.
Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake after the FBI launches an investigation.
I was wondering if we could really achieve what he wants – a limited investigation and a limited range – maybe we could unite our efforts," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "falling apart" despite a well-established over-party blocking.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the moment.
The early elections are only five weeks away, on November 6th – if the Republicans are not expected to be well represented, their attempts to be elected to the highest court in the country will be seriously affected.
George W. Bush called the senators, inviting them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush in the White House and with his help introduced himself to his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where the members are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pens to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees “decreases ” in Kim
A South Korean legislator claims that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sug, citing data from the South Korean UN ministry, said there were 1127 refugees last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
According to Mr Park, the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts demanded by human smugglers, are the key factors.
There is no official comment by Pyongyang.
Most of the refugees from the North eventually get citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the illegal border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and pass easier than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), which divides the two Koreans.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of both sides met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stagnation in nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting between the President of the United States of America Donald Trump and Kim Chen-un in Singapore, where they agreed to generally work for the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho accused US sanctions for the lack of progress since.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident of our national security, and under these circumstances there is no way to disarm ourselves first unilaterally," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosy called Brett Kavanaugh "a hysterical" and said she was not suitable for service at the Supreme Court
Congressional minority leader Nancy Pelosy called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "sisteric" and said he was too unstable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosy commented on this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"There was no way I could have thought that if a woman had reacted in this way, they would have called her "sisteric", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's legal committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected the allegations that he committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times he almost cried out and began to feel as he discussed his family and his student years.
He also categorically condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "a grotesque and coordinated attack against the individual", organised by liberals who are unhappy that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi pointed out that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it became clear that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these allegations and the way he pursues the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi denied when she was asked whether he would try to discredit Kavanaugh if he was appointed and if the Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this – if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not only bound to enter the Supreme Court, but also to the court in which he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, in her capacity as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions with regard to the Law on Available Health Care or the Roe v Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, preconceived man to go into court and expect us to say, "Isn't it wonderful," Pelosi finished.
And women need to master themselves.
It's a reasonable criticism after months and years of spreading rage, and she can't accept it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs Steinham told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was executive director somewhere who shared that she was crying when she got angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she got angry and cried, she said to her accomplice, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just keeps going.
I thought it was genius."
Tears are allowed in the expression of anger, in part because they are misunderstood at the beginning.
One of my clearest memories of a previous job, in an office mostly with men, is like once when I blinked out of overwhelming rage, an older woman from me grabbed me by the door – a freezing manager, whom I was always a little afraid of – and she dragged me to the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they did this to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his campaign for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage relationship with a yacht called "Monkey Business", and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well thought-out solution," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they wanted to do was show up another one.
Someone called the situation Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since it is late in the campaign, it is lagging behind in raising funds and decides that it will not stay in the race if it fails to raise $2 million.
The battle is doomed to failure.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During her speech, in which she said she would not continue with the official campaign, she was overtaken by so many feelings – thanks to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and to be able to turn to voters, not to delegates, and anger against sexism that she felt.
"A man may think I've had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder remembers how the media reacted.
“Someone may think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?

How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Serve Beijing
The first shots in the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and while the battle is still gaining momentum, a gap between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, specialists say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, fired the first warning valve this year, taxing key elements of China's exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tension emerged this week with new duties affecting production for 200 billion US dollars (150 billion British pounds) with effective taxation of half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Each time, Beijing was returning new duties with five to ten percent of US goods for $60 billion.
China has vowed to return every blow to the United States and soon the second largest world economy is not expected to ignore this.
To get Washington to give up means to submit to requests, but to bring his head down in public before Washington would be too embarrassing for C.J.P., the president of China.
Nevertheless, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure from the trade war with the United States can help China in the long run by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political solution, both in Washington and Beijing, can create conditions for an economic crisis in either of the two countries is actually more dangerous than observers have recognised before," said Abigail Grace, a scientific associate on issues related to Asia to the New American Security Centre expert group.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, the foreign minister said
Syria has announced that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and has prayed for assistance in the reconstruction of the country devastated by the war, which has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mualem said the conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas devastated by terrorists to restore them to their normal condition.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and food.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the 2011 war.
Another six million people still living there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in restoring the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional aid or assistance from countries that financed the rebels would not be accepted.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup for 2018 by beating the US team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National in the provinces of Paris, France.
Thus, the US has had six consecutive losses on European land and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its champion crown in the tournament after a team led by Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached the required 14.5 points that guaranteed victory over the United States.
The U.S. star, Phil Mikkelson, who appeared weakly during most of the tournament, blew his first blow to the 16th hole (with a "pair" 3) in the water that lost his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has presented himself well in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament, reaching a balance of 5-0-0 since the competition took place in the current format after 1979.
The American Jordan Spitt lost definitely 5-4.4 of the player in the European team, located at the lowest place in the ranking – Torbörn Olesen of Denmark.
World ranking leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 from Ian Poulter in England, for whom this is probably the last participation of Ryder Coop.
Spanish veteran Sergio García, veteran with eight participation in Ryder Cup, became European with the most winning points in the tournament for all time, and this year increased his assets to 25.5 points.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can pick up the bowl again.
Most important of all, the team and I am happy that I was able to help," the excited Garcia shared after the victory of Europe.
He handes over his fellow countryman John Ram, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods with 24.1 on Sunday's singles.
"I'm incredibly proud that I beat Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching him play," 23-year-old Ram said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and his total balance of Ryder Cup is now 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, won 14 great titles – an indicator by which only Jack Niklaus deviates.
The U.S. team has been having trouble all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have shown high-class golf all day since the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furic said after the disappointing performance of the team: “I’m proud of these boys, they fought.
At one time this morning, we pushed the team of Europe.
There was a battle.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players presented themselves very well.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the Association of Professional Golfers of the United States and our Raider Cup Committee and look only ahead.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you can keep your opponent's hat off.
We were just outgunned."
