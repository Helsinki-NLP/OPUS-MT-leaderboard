Civil Rights Movement Issues Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advantage of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a warning for colourful people travelling to Missouri on the basis of the State's discriminatory principles and racist attacks.
‘The NAACP Travel Recommendation for the State of Missouri, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American passengers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay increased attention to travel across the country as a result of a series of controversial racially motivated incidents that are currently taking place throughout the country,’ the Association Statement states.
NAACP stated that this step was taken on the basis of the current laws of the State of Missouri, which make it easier to defend racistly motivated acts before the courts, as well as because of the proceedings of the authorities involved in criminal proceedings, which aim disproportionately at minorities.
"There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by police only because of the color of their skin, are attacked or killed," said NAACP President for Missouri Rod Chapel for Kansas City Star.
"We still have the highest number of complaints."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organisation to the state of the United States.
Among the incidents that the organization cited were racially motivated hustlings directed against black-skinned students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black-skinned man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in dispute at the beginning of this year after he ran out of gas while travelling across the country and was thrown into custody by the police without being charged with committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to recent statements made by the state’s highest state representation, which states that black skin drivers have a 75 % higher chance of being stopped by the police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and coworkers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be prepared - they should carry with them money for any bail or alert their relatives that they are going to travel by the state."
According to the current figures of the FBI programme, hundreds of hateful behaviors occurred in Missouri in 2015, making the 16th place among all states.
Travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it easier to sue society for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
The American Union for Civil Liberties (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after States approved an immigration law allowing State agents to detain people on the basis of violations of this law, which, according to ACLU, is intended to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but in recent times legal groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family isn't at peace for 12 years!
Sally Anne Bowman's model is murdered.
The girl from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by Chef Mark Dixie right at the restaurant where she worked, he planted stab wounds.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, then kill her.
The killer then sat in a nearby coffee shop and followed a careful criminal work to search the crime scene.
Dixie, former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to imprisonment of 34 years for the murder and rape of Sally's model.
He admitted only to juvenile assault in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a dead girl lying on the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson had been fighting the fateful night.
The killer said, "He was really angry, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"She even attracted the attention of the cabbies," he falsely claimed.
The girl, according to his testimony, was supposed to defend what she could, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her on the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and accused him.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his zeal and his taste for a girl.
When he had sex with her, he felt satisfied and had to light his marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was with his ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol, and taking cocaine, he told Dexie himself.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," the Mirror Linda added.
And after 12 years, the family faces further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He's been injured four times in the last six months.
There are such cruel people at large who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," said the Mirror mother of the deceased girl Linda about the disappearance of the urn with the ashes.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are neither pure nor conservative," says Martin Rage, who operates the Prague boutique of Intimity.
In it you will find designed and luxurious erotic aids.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Maresh.
It started inconspicuously, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a cycle flight after Moravia.
One of them did not only bring a bicycle, but also a box full of unsightly-looking vibrators.
"A variety of moles and dolphins and all that was green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me about lunch.
His friend decided to work with a German manufacturer of design erotic aids Fun Factory, which Martina was interested in, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the associate left to serve another profession, he replaced him.
Today he operates an Intimity boutique on Prague Benedict Street, where he sells erotic aids in the way luxury purses or shoes are usually offered.
And why wouldn't he?
These are also design objects.
Wait, wait, that's what you're talking about at lunch, you think?
Come on, don't be such a puritan!
The Berlin-based Fun Factory store, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, served for boutique Intimity as an inspiration.
They opened it in 2010, and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than everyone here is used to.
No covered exhibits, all made in beautiful, decorative style, products exhibited more like in perfumery.
Martin, with his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka, began to think about how to handle the Prague trade, where it should be and what it should be called.
Intimity's name was popular with both of them.
"It has something to do with intimacy, and it's also, you can say, gentle," he says.
Following the purchase of Internet domain and the search for suitable space, which went in parallel with the various visualizations of the interior.
Eventually, the option was won, which spread the shop into a garden of pleasure and a bedroom, which is the Duke's bed.
Dagmar Štěpánová from FormFatal Studio prepared it for us.
We found space in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem perfect to us because he wasn't on the main street, but because of that, he was sitting in the name of Intimity.
He's intimate.
He's in the alley next to the main one, so no one's expecting customers," says Martin Rage.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to do a trade that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed that they've entered such a business at all.
When I entered the boutique half an hour ago, the streets were empty.
Besides, I didn't even feel like going to the erotic aid store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if there's only women's service in the store, so women don't hesitate to ask for help, that doesn't mean a man's foot doesn't come here.
Most gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men don't usually know how to guess the right size and choose the right size," Martin smiles over a common mistake.
These are the prejudices, the clichés that women need some big help, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses perhaps an unnecessary big vibrator.
Similarly, men choose mostly black underwear, where women tend to weigh more to pink.
The absolute best seller is currently a product called Satisfyer.
From the look on my face, it must be clear that I don't know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a touchless clitoris stimulant.
I have an adolescent need to be admiring the serious tone with which I have been given the interpretation.
It's as if there's no noise.
And it doesn't actually hum.
It is at a good price and has the perfect user reference.
We didn't think he'd be so well received.
It's some recent revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a sea horse vibrator.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The other one was the We-Vibe steam vibrator.
He completely broke down a taboo that some men can endure, and that he sees competition in erotic aids.
"Differences are made," he continued.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
That's the favorite category.
In a loving bond, a woman can control her hand and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of attaching vibrators.
At least we do.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, although they may only use them externally.
While in Western Europe, especially in younger customers, it is very popular.
What about the men?
It's hard to tell if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It would have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin thought.
"We also have aids for them, but to a limited extent." The most sold is the masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It doesn't look like an anatomic copy of the vagina, but "like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
They focus very much on functionality and experience in use.
In Japan, it's completely different.
It makes me wonder.
I thought the Japanese were going to have a lot of erotic help, I object.
"It's the internet reality," I'm told.
The ordinary one is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more related to women using them.
In Japan they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary they are taboo for women." Just for the interesting thing - what the Japanese Tenga brand, which is represented in the boutique of Intimity, sells worldwide, still forms about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs aren't very good.
On the contrary, we are a nation of good fortune.
Definitely unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical business client is between 35 and 50 years old and has some experience with sex life, but also with some help.
There will be something more beautiful, quality, that will add to her partner's life, or to herself." Martin Ráz and his business partner Zdenek Šebeljka will make sure that each product is perfectly functional.
We also don't want to go into specials like bondage and latex because we don't have room for it, but it's not right here.
That kind of thing could reflect the things we're trying to target.
Which is people who have always had sex shops to go to because they were afraid they'd get caught up in something like this.
Many of the products exhibited on the shelves are really popular.
It is also given by the selection of represented reputable brands.
Some of them even won design prices, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first prized was the said sea horse 'and it triggered a change throughout the sector.
It began to drop from cheap materials and on the contrary to work with the health-free, it began to produce other designs, different colors...
It is nice that the Czech Republic is behind the design of some, and the popular designer Anna Mareshová.
I have to say, I was rather surprised at how many people in our design stuff Whoop.de.doo buys from Anna Maresh, even though they're relatively expensive.
They're customers who go straight to Venus' balls from Anna Maresh.
She did a really huge piece of work by showing exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story started as a schoolwork.
Now it's a finished product that's also made with us.
I wanted to have the process of production under control and also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it's not a big production, it's a small series, it's certainly more expensive than a big series.
I may be going a little against the current, but it seems important to keep developments in our Czech Republic.
In a few years we might not be able to produce anything anymore,” says Anna, who and Martin agree that our society is becoming more and more open.
Negative or negative attitude does not occur.
They say they're desperate at the most.
"But even then you start smiling." Currently Anna Maresh has a vibrator in her offer that you can get a personal message for, and this year she also plans her own lubricant gel.
The next year, the vibrating eggs and other news should arrive.
Limitation of Healthy Sex
I want to know where the border of what's right is.
Is there anything Martin Raj isn't selling anymore?
It's very difficult to define.
Once normal, the other one may seem completely abnormal, so we're more of a range of branded manufacturers.
None of them are allowed into extremes.
Before we say good-bye, I have a final question: What was the craziest demand they had?
Just this week, an e-mail came in, in which a lady asked for a masturbation aid for her boyfriend with a long twenty-eight-centimeter nature.
So we had to write that we don't have anything like that.
There's still a question if any of us were joking," Martin sees me as suspicious.
And it happens from time to time...
Morning for Karl Gott.
Two cancers, Alzheimer's!
His friend Karel Schroedry is struggling with a serious illness.
Karla Gotta's best friend is fighting a disease that will steal people's memories.
"Yes, it is, unfortunately, true," confirmed Bleska's sad information by a singer himself.
I know about my illness, and so far, given the circumstances, I'm handling it quite a bit.
"I take medications that have accompanying diseases to slow down," he added, saying that he thanked someone close to him for his support.
The whole extended family came down here to make life easier for Karl.
Eva's wife tries to be at home as much as she can, behind her father's house on the White Mountain, even daughters from the first marriage of Zuzan and Teresa, care for the son of Karel said Carlos.
He struggled twice with cancer, and he also gave his experience to Slavík to support him during his difficult treatment.
She's got 60 chemos behind her.
He was able to return to work after them even on the tennis court and ski slopes.
"From the astrologer I'm supposed to be here by 90," Karel Bleska said.
He's a fighter.
He still wants to sing.
"I repeat the words of the song so that I don't forget them," Karel admitted.
The same disease is now being fought in the constitution by actress Kveta Fialová.
Do you have a patient in your family with Alzheimer's?
Look at how you treat him.
The Chilean Parliament lifted the ban on interruptions, the law will assess the ÚS.
In Chile, an absolute ban on artificial abortion is still valid and therefore must not be implemented for health reasons.
"I hate that the legislators have filed a complaint against the Constitutional Court and that ten people will now decide what we have been negotiating in Parliament for more than two years," Socialist Senator Isabel Allende complained.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members, and in late August it should get a new president, who according to AFP is close to the opposition.
The Act repealing the absolute ban on interruptions, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, approved the Senate on 19 July.
The rightful opposition then announced that the law would attack the court because it said it violated the right of an unborn child to life.
Members of the vote on the bill last month postponed until it was analysed by the Joint Parliamentary Commission.
On Wednesday, the Members approved the proposal and the Senate recommitted it.
According to the new legislation, there should be no criminal artificial abortion in three cases: if a woman's life is at risk if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy is caused by rape.
Similar exceptions have existed according to the Spanish newspaper El País in Chile since 1931, even before women received election rights there in 1949.
The absolute ban on interruptions in 1989 was introduced by the right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet only a few months before he left the President's office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on interruptions.
The following are Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, there are now about 20 women behind bars who spend up to 30 years in prison for abortion.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court described as murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The target of Trump's White House is now Statue of Liberty
The criticism of the statue is a sign of a change in the regime.
The Americans could talk about this as well as anyone else - see the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein's statue on the Baghdad Square of Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of Trump's regime, surely knew what was going on when, in a passionate debate with reporter CNN Jim Acosta on the topic of Presidential proposals for drastic restrictions on legal immigrants, he set out as a symbolic axe at the Statue of Liberty.
It's good to know that Miller didn't attack a statue like that.
He would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and copycats of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its meaning, especially the fact that a plaque with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the platform in 1903, up to 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller reprimanded Acosta with the words: “I don’t want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the whole world.
The poem that was placed on the platform additionally, and which you refer to is not part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he himself put it, it's not history.
This is especially the startling words of Emma Lazarus, who resonate today - calls not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Let it come to me, who is going down, who is poor, who can hardly breathe freely, who is in the midst of many cities who are poor."
And in modern times, we can better watch these “poor worms ” on our screens than ever before.
Miller wasn't trying to criticise poetry - he wanted to explain that these people aren't welcome in the United States.
This conflict of the significance of the statue is part of a major political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict of the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends who after her death were trying to plant a poster with poems on the statue floor, knew quite well that she was going into a high political game.
The statue was to express the connection between the French and American republican governments by representing a classic theme, namely, the woman's embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has its own voice.
She also has a very different name: Mother of exiles.
The combination of poems with the image of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the rightful person has long sought to reverse that meaning.
The famous commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jana Baptizer in Trump’s appearance of power - in 2010 argued that the Soch of Freedom does not really invite anyone into the country but represents early neoconstructivism, bringing the U.S. flame to the rest of the world: “The Soch of Liberty is moving forward.
He's taking out the U.S. Freedom torch and offering it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not supposed to light the way to the United States."
Limbaugh's amazingly striking the important thing.
The meaning of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes a statue from the point of view of an exhausted and cursed traveler, who often comes across the ocean with hope in the heart of a new country after a long and frightening voyage.
It's literally about looking at the world with the eyes of people looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this perspective, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And, of course, that's a perspective that Miller and Trump definitely don't recognize.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to stir up hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black sings praise for Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle recalls when the British team had only two Scottish members.
The director of the Athletic Federation of the United Kingdom Neil Black said that a strong squadron of 16 Scots in the World Cup team would be “a huge benefit to the team”.
For MS in London 2017, starting on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes was selected.
Black believes that in Scotland "something special is going on" and British athletics could learn from the Scots.
"We will try to understand and adapt to this - we will work on it," Black said.
“I talked to people from the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they've done.
People in the streets think that, too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will seek a medal, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the team.
“Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
“A number of athletes, whether Scottish or other nationals' athletes, came from a room with a sense of great pride and motivation.
The feelings Eilidh spoke to were unrepeatable."
A silver medalist from the Commonwealth who will compete in the 400m race on her fifth World Cup said that it is “incredible” that 16 Scottish athletes are on the British team.
Previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
In the middle track, Muirová established five British and two European records in the last year alone.
The MS will participate in the run at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the line at 1500 m. In this year's season, he won the British Team Races and the Annual Games.
Doyle remembers his first championship, which was the only other Scottish member of Lee McConnell's team.
The team captain led her “very proud” to the fact that not only many of her colleagues had joined the team, but in many cases they would also attack to participate in the finals and medals.
“The extraordinary thing about being captain of the team is that I was chosen by the other members of the team. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was elected members of the team is a pleasure," she added.
“Obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots who have joined the team.
It proves where I moved to.
They're athletes who will think of the front seats on the stage.
And my opening statement?
Yes, I think she did well.
I only drew attention to the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and to rejoice that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance to race, and I'm going to enjoy an incredible atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: do not resort to public functions if you do not tolerate voter criticism
Our father knew of his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to criticize him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not keep him cold.
But he didn't try to keep his critics quiet.
Because in 1783, Washington said: “Freedom of speech may be taken away from us - and foolish and will be led as sheep to slaughter. ”
That brings me to Maryland is the governor of Larry Hogan, who needs to work on how to act like Washington.
Hogan’s employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week the American Union for Civil Liberties sued him for the above-mentioned acts.
The employees of the governor rejected the action as groundless, and many views of “who cares” appeared in the comments on the Internet.
"It's just Facebook," many users said.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolute democratic state, it is an extremely popular Republican governor.
He can boast of the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not pompous.
It is evident that his state governs itself with certainty and strictly respects the principles.
It has also turned out that using Facebook as the main means of connecting with its voters - an exception is not the publication of the first photograph with a bare head after receiving chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor's website - which is a public forum, designated as official and managed by his employees paid from taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with Washington Post Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chase, she defended the governor by blocking comments from the post of moderating contributions.
However, using images of Internet trolls, spammers, or angry people is too easy.
Washington Post reported a number of real people who had their posts deleted.
And that is exactly what they are - real people who speak to their elected leaders; teachers, business and pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his commentary, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
The lawyer of Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md., inquired about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I politely noted that I was disappointed by his inadequate response to hate crimes and other current reports," she wrote in the Washington Post newspaper commentary section.
"I do not like the idea that once a number of people comment on the same subject, some people are referred to as promoting the so-called collective effort rather than being recognised as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the governor’s employees called “a concentrated spam interest” would likely call others“ a defense. ”
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage contributions by blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much more comfortable than in the past, when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets where they would collect and burn all the critical copies or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public figure to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump faces a lawsuit by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
President Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated James C. Cacheris' first addition in Alexandria, where she prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also awaited visits from ACLU for its use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington, Washington, the price of the post office was practically the same as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily printing quadrupled and his position as leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms like “Juricola”, “Valerius”, “Belisarius” and “Portius”, wrote letters to the newspapers and questioned Washington’s decision.
According to historical documents collected by people in the framework of the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were gathered in his office criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amitia, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he did not shut them up.
Freedom of expression, disapproval and intimidation lie at the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept it.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, using more data than at home abroad.
Foreign Czechs consume more from their tariff than at home.
Most of the time they move in Austria, but the data consumption in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
For vacations, however, they have more time to grind on the web, under the sunflower they usually do not have the opportunity to join the Wi-Fi.
A beach, a bath, and a smart phone in your hand.
This is what the typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of the local operators at home prices.
This comes from O2's fresh statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travelers abroad have more data available within the terminal than at home.
It is no wonder, therefore, that in Croatia, where the minimum of ours rides through the winter, data consumption has risen even fifty times in this summer season.
In second place, Italy placed itself in the database.
The Czechs will call on Germany for the most minutes, where many of them will go for work during the summer.
Croatia, according to the data of the Association of Czech Travel Offices, visits 800,000 Czechs annually, is our most popular holiday destination.
People here, however, exchanged the book for sharing experiences with their mobile phone.
The record was this year's 7th of July.
"Ten of millions of photographs would fit into the transferred data," said the director of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Cieslarová.
Although Croatia leads in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users moves in neighbouring countries.
First place is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia to the fourth and Italy to the sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active vacation, for which we do not have that much time to grind on the Internet.
"According to Austria, the Czech Republic is heading for the Adriatic," Cieslar explained.
While the data was recorded by the operator after the release of high annual roaming charges, there is a much lower increase in phone numbers.
The number of minutes called for in roaming has doubled compared to last year.
With a huge head start in front of other countries, Germany dominates.
"Roaming calls are used rather by corporate customers on business trips," Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in the home atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
Ronan Rafferty's former golf team will be hoping for a pleasant atmosphere in the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area of East Lothian, hosting the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year on the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the finals, submitted to Paul Eales. This year he will perform the role of Ambassador of the tournament in representing the founder of the club and CEO of Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club grow up slowly in front of my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
"Players will be able to love the top quality of the playground.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a zealous defender of this game and proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
Englishman Eales will for the first time defend the championship title, despite winning the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"It makes me feel good," said a Southport golfer.
“I had no opportunity to defend my victory at Extremadura Open because the year after my victory the tournament was cancelled.
The return to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year, when for me and my wife Sharon, winning really meant a lot.
It was a beautiful time I won't forget."
Gary Orr is returning to the home land, which joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from the end of this year.
This event will be his first participation from Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on home soil," Orr said about Hellensburgh.
“You want to succeed and you feel great pressure.
I really like playing again, and I think I'm doing great.
I'm happy with the result so far."
The former winner of Masters Ian Woosnam and the winners of the Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty..
Orr and former Captain Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Available for the tournament is free. Parking is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be paid to the Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the land of gold in Indonesia
When Burdin Degei cooks dinner, he doesn't use a stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a pelvis.
In its wooden hut, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the province of Papua Indonesia, a woman usually simply throws sweet potatoes - in the language of local “note” - right into the fire.
He takes out half an hour of potatoes, and he likes to taste it with his hands unwashed.
Bardin sits on a muddy land - the cottage is not equipped with furniture - where he does his daily work, such as washing laundry in mud water from a nearby swamp.
The bucket in the room without the roof is filling up the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she was not assigned to work.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late at night presents a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, soldiers sit in the village.
“In the afternoon after five o’clock no one will be allowed to wander around the village,” says Bardin.
It is a rare sight of everyday life on the high plain of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of a public show of hands in front of the occupying army.
The current protest movement against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region, with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua New Guinea and West Papua - an independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and desolate city, where you can reach after 90 minutes of flight from the capital of Jayapura province to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach pulverizing by drive.
Public transport in this place doesn't work.
The city with 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of wool sheets in shades of gray and rust.
Very few Indonesians looked at this place, including journalists, and virtually no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christians, the local people worshiped a god named Uga Tame.
And that's not all.
“We were not used to wearing these dresses,” says Bardin, pointing to his colorful, handmade turban, dark shirt and shiny skirt.
"We used to carry only leaves."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province - 28% of the population live below the poverty line and child mortality is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, however, it is an Indonesian land of gold.
The largest and most elaborate gold mine in the world of Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from the American Phoenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, home to about 153 000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015 did Freeport earn gold and copper at $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports wood mining at an estimated value of $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression by the mighty Indonesian army.
An investigation in 2005 revealed that Freeport paid local military forces and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
The popes calling after self-government are threatening this golden goose and are therefore severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass killings in the tribal area of Papua during the 1970s were likened to genocide, as the Asian Commission for Human Rights put it.
In the past year alone, more than 3900 peaceful Protestants were arrested by the Indonesian police in the region.
In Will Lose Everything, the 2016 report of the British archdiocese describes the atrocities that occurred last year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - according to the next report is particularly popular rape and execution by electric current - and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at the Human Rights Watch organization.
The whole situation has been strained by the fact that Papuan sources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% report to Christianity, but demographic changes with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands of Java, Bornea, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
“Immigrants started selling chickens and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans,” explains Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to the capital of Jayapura Province.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - Mama-mama (women) - have lost their jobs."
In 2014, Indonesian President Joko Vidodo, who is named Joko, promised to solve inequality and violations of rights within his presidential campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter secured his trip to the Presidential Palace in a corner of 27 of the 29 Districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua, and local people feel betrayed.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with the hope of hearing our call for justice," you said.
The fact is, just two months after Jacob's October inauguration, Paniai suffered a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at the campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers came out of the grey at night on motorcycles.
Two of the surprised kids told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers, the edict and the tone to which it had been pronounced, and later returned with four other soldiers, stated local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in the underprivileged condition were chasing a group of children and beating them with arms, bringing victims and witnesses to the scene.
One of the soldiers then burned a group of children.
One of the children, a 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby election commission building, and the following day things were still coming up.
About 1,000 young papal men and women gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and military headquarters and demanded justice.
They came with ceremony hunting bows and performed a dance of wait - where they run in circles and imitated the singing of birds - the papal tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began throwing stones at buildings.
With increasing tension, a radio command was issued to soldiers: “If a crowd tries to resist at least three times, you are allowed to shoot," according to the TIME weekly in an official document, the contents of which have never been published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of Enarotali Kego Koto district, recognized the threatening danger and called on the residents to move to their homes.
But no one cared about his words.
“When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist,” said TEME weekly on the porch of his painted wooden house.
Kayame doesn't yet know who the shooter was, but according to him, there was a bullet in one of the present soldiers.
"There were a lot of people around and a lot of shootings," he added.
One local resident, Alfius Youw, said his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, was shot three times.
“I ran to the body to make sure it was really him,” said TEME week’s grieving voice Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were merely “providing” the station that was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," the Pappu police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiya, said in 2015.
"It is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many were injured.
The murder report was filed with the Jakarta media the following day.
Three weeks later, he delivered a passionate speech to Joko in Jayapura and expressed his understanding of the families of the victims and promised to deal with violence in Papua New Guinea.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
Minister of National Security Viranto announced in October 2016 that he will introduce an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve the violent acts that have occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, however, excuses began to speak.
“Most acts of violence have occurred a long time ago.
Some of them happened in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be an easy task," he said.
However, in an interview held in Jakarta on 5 June for the TIME weekly, Viranto claimed that he did not plan to implement any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that “all cases will be brought to justice.”
Viranto, accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said that 11 cases of human rights violations have so far been settled in Papua, including the incident in Pania.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Panai welcomed his claims with distrust.
"In the last three years I have been questioned about four times, but until now I have not seen anything," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
As he says, several years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Paniai residents who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to his words, he was beaten by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the body was buried, the army began to seek me," he said.
And the shooting still doesn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired at a village in the neighboring Deiyai.
An argument involving one person and another 17 were injured occurred between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting the man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Doww (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at them and the answers were a warning shot.
However, the locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesia Paramilitarist police) started shooting in the crowd and killed one person.
“There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation,” said the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lived near the hospital and was witness to the arrival of the wounded.
"I haven't left the house in two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has sought to punish the participating police officers and to withdraw the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always an eye for the Indonesian government.
Lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous peoples of the tribes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in central high places.
Many of them joined the Pappuai Liberation Movement (OPM) - an army of rebels who protects the rights of the Papuan by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai, not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents in recent years, all under the pretext of “security of national sovereignty”.
Some of them are never to be seen again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papuai as a “tragic and forgotten place”.
The fire is fueled by poverty.
The few rices sold in Enarotali are too expensive for the locals.
And bread is still unattainable.
The local people are growing their food, mainly sweet potatoes, fruit, and leafy vegetables.
In the fields, women work; each of them works four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most harvests are intended for family needs, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport has opened several air routes and new immigrants have started to flow into the country, there has been an increase in economic disparities between native Papuan and immigrants.
As few jobs as possible are usually occupied by more educated and richer immigrants.
Papuan people rarely have the capital and education needed to get into business.
"Young people are moving out of villages for lack of employment opportunities and money," said John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council of Panai.
Because of isolation, Papua Province is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp - were expelled from the papaya because of “the lack of cooperation with the authorities”, all despite the fact that they received such a rare film license.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, promised Jokok in his election campaign to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development.
“For foreign journalists working in the rebel eastern regions of Papua and West Papua, there is a high risk: the lack of recognition of visas and the inclusion on the black charter,” said the statement.
The lack of news from per foreign journalists means that international pressure on the Indonesian issue of Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - the United Nations Human Rights Council on the investigation of “various and widespread acts of violence” in Papua, including shooting in Pania.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
The Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir has shaken the charges when he told reporters in Jakarta that: “Democratic system still applies in Indonesia and the media are free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of violations of human rights.”
Local people are calling after the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Human Rights Envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4th, the local people called on the source, who also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous, the password “we want freedom”.
Further elections are planned in Indonesia for 2019, but the popes say they will not elect Jokoki.
"Jok is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Joko to know that the inhabitants of Paniai - apart from living in constant fear of the looting army - are at war with poverty, poor education and the health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Paniai, like the other Papuans, view their voice as “the debt ” that Joko must repay.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family, the victims of the Panamanian shooting continue in the last symbolic act of resistance: they bury the victims' bodies on land across from the police and military stations.
With the knowledge that justice will never be done for enough, at least it will not allow responsible persons to forget their crimes.
"He was killed by a member of our family," Yacobus said with his head closed.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy picked up a huge shipment of cocaine into Australia.
The French Navy detained a 1.46 tons of cocaine in the Pacific Ocean worth about 256 million dollars.
The shipment was headed for Australia.
A four-member ship crew was arrested, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
A yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America and was taken into port in Nouméa, the metropolis of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian Intelligence Service has indicated that, in cooperation with its international partners, it will seek to determine exactly where and where the drugs are going and to discover the "Lithuania Syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have led to the halt of a large number of drugs heading to Australia," said its Executive Director, Col Blanch.
Drugs were destroyed this week in Noumée.
Australia is an attractive target for their smugglers because of high street drug prices.
The country is also facing the problem of an increasing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current raid isn't the first one lately.
Last month, three men were accused of carrying a large number of drugs from the United States to Australia, trying to smuggle through the Pacific Ocean on a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, they need to be reminded of drinking.
The problem may be in senior homes, according to physicians at the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavly Mádlová, the infusion of physiological solution that is injected with a thin needle under the skin could be the solution.
But they only apply in medical devices so far.
The older a person is, the more water drops in his body.
"And it also loses feeling thirsty, so seniors generally take less fluid and dehydrate very quickly," Mádlová said.
I'm sure they should drink two liters.
"But getting into an old man so many fluids is a big problem," she added.
In senior homes, she often thinks that no doctor is watching.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually resolved by infusion.
"I think that even there should be gradually introduced so that they can receive subcutaneous infusion," she said.
In a day, according to her, up to two gallons [2.5 L] of saline can be added to the old people.
Lack of fluids can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration will prove to be a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day that old man says he can't get out of bed, he speaks confusedly," she added.
In case of neglect, it may result in a brain accident.
The blood will thicken and entangle the blood in the brain, and kidney failure is also threatening.
Lying patients should not be covered with feathers, a maximum cotton sheet.
One-off diapers can also be a problem.
"It's more medically demanding, but it would be ideal for the patient to detect and let the skin boil sometimes," the doctor said.
In Dubai it was the second night of The Torch.
In Dubai on Friday, one of the world's largest living clouds was on fire. The firefighters had to evacuate all residents 337 metres high and 79 floors.
In the last two years it has been the second fire of this tall building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch (Poderden).
All the residents of the building were evacuated, and no injuries were sustained, and the cause of the fire is unknown.
“We slept and were awakened by the alarm. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," said Reuters Geroge, one of the inhabitants of the skyscraper.
Dubai Civil Defense said firefighters managed to get fire under control around 4 o'clock in the morning (0:00 GMT), where they continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they provide alternative accommodation for the disabled.
The incident could once again trigger a discussion on the safety of materials used to build tall buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation, which started with the management of the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015, resulted in the most damaged coating and external panels used for decoration or insulation.
The British police stated that the system of isolation and siege of London’s Grennfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in a red fire that killed nearly 80 people.
The results of the survey showed that more than one of five passengers in the United States carries prohibited items on board aircraft
A survey among passengers showed that more than 20 percent of them deliberately or unknowingly carried out prohibited items through the checkpoint of the US government agency Transportation Security Administration on board the aircraft. At least six percent of the passengers entered the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Fewer than one percent of passengers claim to have found out late that they were traveling with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The results of the survey carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - which was answered by more than 1000 respondents - resulted in a higher likelihood of infringement of the rules for younger passengers.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had attempted to travel consciously with the subject prohibited by TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with several thousand hours running in comparison with less than 15 percent of members of the X-Gen.
Among the most common items that have escaped the attention of TSA are food and alcohol.
More than three percent of the respondents knowingly carried a sharp object through the guard, while 2.2 percent of the women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the men surveyed also admitted that they deliberately carried the illicit drug aboard the aircraft.
The company stated that it was doing research among passengers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally passed unauthorized objects through airport control and how much it did on purpose.
It is no surprise that most people who have carried unauthorized objects - whether knowingly or unconsciously - travel by aircraft very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA Directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what kind of fluids they can carry on the plane.
It is no surprise, then, that TSA has confiscated the most of the currently banned liquids.
For a time, people thought that TSA would be dealing with books in the same way as with smuggled goods.
The excess of liquids is allowed in the framework of domestic flights, not international flights.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on postponement of planned directives to reduce emissions of Obama administration
After 15 states were indicted by the Environment Agency, her boss Scott Pruitt rejected her earlier decision to postpone implementation of the former Obama administration's carbon dioxide reduction plan.
Pruitt has introduced changes to his plan, and he responds more sequencingly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This refers to the last deadline set on 1 October when States should start implementing the 2015 Regulation to reduce the amount of ground ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “interventions with local decisions or threatening economic growth”.
Pruitt, who, prior to his role as Head of EPA President Donald Trump's position as Attorney General of State Oklahoma, served for a long time as a reliable opposer of stricter environmental regulations.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or removed regulations designed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The sudden centre turn is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA's contractor had exceeded its authority in order to delay the integration of Obama's administration plan, which required the oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to cooperation with States through comprehensive processes and the implementation of new standards within a given time frame.
"For the governments of the previous administration, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines and wait for it to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to the settlement and further setting of plans," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen complaints at the EPA in his previous position.
“We do not believe in the regulation by means of a dispute and we take the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes out of it."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may use "the possibility of delay and all other legally available authority" at a certain point in order to ensure that the regulation "will be based on sound policies and the most accessible information".
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more extensive copy of the ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month aims to postpone implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has still not been passed by the Senate.
New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was headed by a coalition of states that were suing the EPA this week, said that the group was unwilling to allow legal pressure.
"The EPA's opinion - following our trial - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million non-Yorkians and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, D.C.
The ground ozone is produced when conventional harmful substances from the fired cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and every year thousands of premature deaths.
Public health defenders and environmentalists are cheering Pruitt's sudden change with gratitude.
“It’s disturbing what pressure must be developed to change the thinking of responsible people and to protect the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological pull of Trump's administration, which is trying to help polluters and special interests."
He spilled acid on a man, but he's not dangerous in court.
You never know what can happen to you.
One minute you're home with your family and you're laughing, the next you're suddenly going to change your whole life from the ground up.
And the worst part is there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate was met by Andreas Christopherose of Great Britain, whose face was laced with acid by an unknown attacker, who was finally acquitted.
The information was provided by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door with the Christopheros.
Andreas has risen to open the door.
He thought there was a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
A man he's never seen in his life, immediately after being opened without warning, he spilled acid with the words, "This is for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart on me as nothing, and I only felt an indescribable pain on my skin," Andreas said.
His family rushed him to the hospital, but there his relatives learned a terrible report - according to doctors, he had no chance of survival.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent were affected by the face that doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient’s body.
A major complication for Christopherose was the loss of the eyelids.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his suffering.
Today Christopheros has 12 operations that are far from the last.
The injuries that will affect the victims of acid attacks may, according to plastic surgeons, require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment.
Even after extensive and long-term treatment, the victims have tissue scarred for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and fight deformity and deformity all their life," said Professor Peter Dewulski, a spokeswoman of the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgery.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is certain that an unknown man must have mistaken him for someone.
Because the perpetrator believed that he was taking revenge on a man who sexually abused his loved one.
The police investigated the whole case properly, and the attacker was subsequently investigated.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later the verdict to the horror of Christopheros’ family changed significantly.
"The three judges finally concluded that the punishment should be abolished because the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the past few years, the number of attacks by vascular substances has increased significantly.
The Ministry of Interior expressed its intention to lay down new guidelines to state representatives on the classification of cranes.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
However, victims of such attacks do not intend to give up.
They demand that the UK government impose stricter and longer penalties on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other edifying substances.
They also require strict checks on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often commonly available in different stores, as these are various cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai was on fire at night with the famous skyscraper The Torch, which belongs to the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, the inhabitants of the 80-story building were able to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to the spokeswoman of Dubai, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
However, according to several residents of the house, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," one of the tenants said.
Also, according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, fire broke out in the highest floors and spread down with falling fires.
We were asleep.
We got woken up by an alarm, people screaming.
"We were running down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," the ten-minute renter George described.
Another of the CNN witnesses estimated that the flames captured about 40 flats.
At least two cars were destroyed on the ground when the burning parts of the building hit them.
About two hours later, according to a civilian defense report, a fire was managed to get under control.
The reason for its creation is not yet known.
According to witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the power went out.
A large fire damaged Dubai's skyscraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroyed over a hundred flats.
There are about 680 apartments in the whole building.
Neither did anyone else get hurt, for the inhabitants managed to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became with its 352 metres highest residential building in the world.
The following year, another Dubai skyscrape was able to save him for a record.
The culturist had incredible 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, in a sample of 23-year-old Ippolita, there was a large collection of illicit drugs - from steroids to diuretics to medicines for Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix didn't help him with the title, he ended up fourth.
Now a four-year distance and a criminal prosecution threatens a bodybuilder.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugbyist David Vasta was tested positive for 11 doping substances, which was a record number of athletes caught.
A three-ling player began taking steroids a year ago when culture failed.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She's been reaching out to an ex-lover!
Barely Lucka Vondráčková entered the territory of the Czech Republic, is in one round.
And it also draws attention wherever it comes from.
Last time her ex-lover, Michal Long, was in her arms, with whom she had lived for three years.
At the time, the actor was 12 years older and longed for a family.
Lucia was only 19 at the time, and she certainly did not want to hang her career on a nail.
So they went apart, but friends stayed until today.
They also proved at the press conference TV Prima, where they met for a long time.
Coincidentally, both of them got into the blue color.
At first, they ignored each other, but then they approached each other, and Lucie laughed at Michal's jokes when she fell for her belly.
Then they hugged and willingly posed to the photographers.
However, their meetings were not a coincidence, because they will play together a lover couple in a new edition of the Prima Captain Exner.
The Islamists were given life in Great Britain for the preparation of the assassination.
On Thursday, the British court sent four members of an Islamic cell to life in prison who called the Three Musketeers and planned a terrorist attack against the police and the army, according to the prosecutor's office.
Four men, two of whom attended the training camp in Pakistan and were previously convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
The authorities then believed that they were about to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, a knife with inscriptions that in Arabic mean "disbelievers" and a model gun.
This was the moment the MI5 Secret Service agent was stationed in the vehicle listening device.
"Recent assassinations have shown what horror the defendants could have caused if they hadn't been stopped," Sue Hemming, the prosecutor's representative, said.
Three sentences of 28, 25 and 33 years may apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convicted person, 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men declared themselves innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by MI5.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the defendants’ claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 °C in Hodonínsk.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained on peak for only two days.
With 38,3 degrees Celsius, which was recorded in The Watchtower in Hodonínsk, it was overcome by Thursday, which has thus far become the hottest day of this year.
The Czech Hydrometeorology Institute confirmed this.
On Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records of 35 out of 145 meteorological stations measured over 30 years were exceeded or settled.
On Thursday, only nine long-range stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, in The Watchtower, the fourth temperature was the same as the previous record of 2013.
In Lednica, Břeclav, a quarter of 37.4 degrees above the original maximum of four tenths of the degree and in Pogoreljice, the current 37.1 degrees above the record by three tenths.
Both records, like those of The Watchtower, dates back to 2013.
In the west, it was ten degrees smaller.
High temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After the Watch Tower, the largest heat in Dyjákice was in Znojmsk and Broda nad Dyj in Břeclav, where mercury had climbed 37.8 degrees, but the record did not prevail.
On the other hand, in Western and Northwestern Czechs, according to the Czech Republic's website, the fourth highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures began to grow there until later this afternoon," meteorologists said.
Current heats in the Czech Republic will gradually resound according to the Czech Republic, and on Sunday there could be even more significant rain.
In most places of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia and Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of visa policy.
China has been trying to apply its influence for decades without using the means of force.
Every year, they spend $10 billion to support language schools and build universities abroad, push their entertainment industry on foreign markets, and try to attract Western tourists.
But Beijing can't do that.
The local state media is talking about a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic change and modernisation.
Last year, however, the number of visitors increased by only 3.8 percent, and about 80 percent of the tourists in China came from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.
This is due, inter alia, to the fact that despite all its global aspirations China does not welcome the foreigner with an open arm, it assesses the situation in the world's most populous economy professor at Beijing University Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for everything is Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free contacts with China, citizens of the others have to deal with the visa ahead.
The Chinese authorities in the United States are therefore comparable to the celebrations of China’s new year.
The visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait long hours in the front, you have to charge $100 and more for extra services.
Such restrictions build significant economic obstacles.
The Journal of Economics and Finance study showed that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which shares less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and lives there for less than one percent of the population, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself when tourism uses its political objectives, such as in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China reduced transport to South Korea in the spring of the South Korean missile system, the South Koreans paid it off and avoided China.
In May, the number of visitors dropped by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan rose by 85 percent.
This all affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report by the US Central Bank, Fed, China was able to leave up to $190 billion as a result of China’s foreign travel, while China earns about $35 billion per year in currency sales to tourists.
According to the official numbers on the development of the balance of payments, China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism last year, equivalent to 44 percent of the Chinese surplus in trade in goods.
Thus, the small number of tourists in the country, which anxiously prevents the outflow of capital, inflicts a very painful wound.
However, the factors designated are only one expression of more general restraint against foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has ever heard of immigrants.
As early as 2013, there were fewer than a million foreigners living in all of China.
Some cities in the United States also have more.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroad of immigration, has a double.
A number of scientific works show that immigrants usually revive economic growth, business and innovation.
In China, however, you will practically not find them.
Solving these problems will be politically difficult, but the step that is being offered is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian States, in particular India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and reduce visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
At the Plzeň Zoo, they multiplied deadly poison reptiles.
Plzeňsk Kingdom of poison can be enjoyed by young people right away by three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
At the exhibition visitors will see only all nine fresh Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 metres.
"Growing up even meters," said zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba.
The cubs of the other two species, the mortals and the red cobras, will be gaining strength in the breeding grounds of the garden.
We still can't tell when people will see them.
"We would not like to lose them," said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying it could take a year or two.
The Australian snake-killers came into the world eight, the offspring of a breeding couple from a population around Sydney.
"The only person that visitors can see in the exhibition belongs to mortals from the Perth area," Vobruba said, with the fact that in human care it is necessary for mortals to winter 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
A hundred percent success was accompanied by a snorkel of African swimming cobras of red.
A couple at the Plzeň Zoo hatched four young eggs.
"Incubation lasted 65 days," added Vobrub.
This species, in nature, on its victim, is injecting poison up to four metres away.
Aiming for the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
The cubs of all three species live in the zoo with the mouse holts.
Within 40 days in the garden they still expect the laziness of the cubs from the sleek mamba black, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to the unverified transcription of the telephone conversation, Trump creates pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall
The U.S. daily Washington Post issued a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a phone call from January 27th with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nenet, Trump ordered him to stop publicly reporting that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The American president blamed him for publicly condemning the construction of the wall, allegedly saying, "You can't talk like that in the press."
Trump, as part of his campaign, vowed to build a wall along the southern borders and report that he would pay for it, Mexico.
His first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also escaped to the public, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the US oversight agreement for refugees heading to Australia was "smirky" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which went into the rule of President Obama - would look like a "dreamed" after proposing a ban on refugees entering the US.
Trump terminated the call after he explained to Turnbull that “this is my most unpleasant call of day. ”
Tusk was testifying again at the prosecutor's office for Smolensk.
"He has something to worry about," said the brother of the dead president, the Prime Minister's brother, PiS Jaroslaw Kaczyński, at Tusk.
"I have nothing to worry about, Kaczynski will not intimidate me," Tusk replied and found out to the current leadership of the country that he was trying to use justice against political opponents.
On leaving the D.A.'s office, he was waiting for Tusk on TV TV 24 dawgs, which Donald Tusk scandalized! and wished the politician a hundred years!
Tusk thanked for the support and assured him that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not frighten me."
The prosecutors say nothing, but they do not doubt that justice is to serve the current Polish rulers as an instrument against opponents, opposition or people they do not like, and I fear that I belong to this group.
The interview was the second time.
The expert was interrogated at the D.A.'s office for the second time, and this time the interrogation involved doubts in the autopsy of the victims of the Smolen disaster.
There's also been a body replacement in the coffins.
Families were forbidden to open coffins, and there had to be some reason.
And the reason they were afraid of scandal was because it would make Polish-Russian relations more difficult.
"The maintenance of good relations at all costs, despite such terrible events, should have served to make Donald Tusk very important in the EU," Kaczyński said on Catholic TV Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would spoil Tuskov's chances of obtaining the most important chair in the Union, which, however, Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczynski also announced that he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it could happen differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not notice.
Tusk submitted an eight-hour hearing with the D.A.'s office on April 19th.
He didn't even speak as a suspect at the time, only as a witness.
However, many of his appeals for questioning were considered to be part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and the chief of PIS Kaczyńska to discredit Tusk as a political rival by associating with various scandals.
The Prosecutor's Office in Poland is subordinated to the Minister of Justice, who acts as Attorney General.
An appeal for questioning came after the election of Tusk as head of the European Council, to whom Kaczyński worked hard, but was in vain trying to prevent, inter alia, from visiting Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tuskov's mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested in the end.
In this case, he left Warsaw at the barbershops and the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

Where can Czechs vote everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the House from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
It's coming from a decree that regulates the delivery of ballots to a foreign country.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update and is currently under review.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens elected Members abroad.
"Since the last amendment of the 2013 decree, there have been some changes to be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry justifies its procedure.
"In some countries new representative offices have been created, some authorities have been closed, or there has been a change of representation level," the material reads.
The declaration shall contain two annexes, the first of which shall indicate the representative offices for which the paper ballots are submitted.
This group of authorities includes representatives of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a vote in print.
It's their list that's changed by decree.
Four years ago, Czechs could elect, for example, the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassy units are closed.
The Czech Republic also abolished its representation in Bamak and Kyoto, Malaysia.
He won't even vote at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
Newly they are on the list of the embassy in Kenya's Nairobi, Senegal's capital Dakar and the Zambian Lusace.
Since the last parliamentary elections in Asia, the Czech Republic has expanded its representations on the General Consulate in Iraq's Irbil and Cheng-tu, the capital of China's S'-chchuan Province.
Voting tickets will also be available for registered voters at the Czech Embassys in Burma and Cambodia.
The Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to elect Members in the election rooms at the representative offices or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the State Election Commission shall determine the country for whose candidates a foreign vote shall be taken.
This was the first time in 2002, when decisions were made between South Moravian candidates.
In the next two elections, Czechs voted abroad among the South Bohemian candidates.
As in 2013 the Central Bohemia region was selected this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
During the premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 about 6,700 people, four years later 8222.
Premature House Elections Four years ago, 10,571 voters arrived at the embassy.
Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: activists remember racist lynching
Ford Mercury from 1948 passed around watching Monroe, Georgia, and scribbled towards Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before a car with four black - knit passengers and a white driver could get to the bridge, a group of white men with guns covered the road.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - long pulled out of a cigarette and looked at the front window of the car.
Inside, passengers trembled with fear.
"We want the n--and Roger!" cried the man.
"Bring it to me!"
Silence will break the roar of a young black man who is pulled out of the passenger seat.
This scene is fortunately a mere reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men jumps over Roger’s neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, the Moore's Ford Bridge has been visited regularly by a group of activists who reconstruct the fateful night of 1946, when there were two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcomová and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - to kill members of Kukluxklan.
No one's ever been tried for murder.
“It’s surprising that in all these years, the only person has not been arrested - although we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity,” Tyrone Brooks, who helps to organize the event, has been heard.
"It is a stain on our history and burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman in Georgia and a lifelong civil rights fighter.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic challenge to take place. Every year the community of Monroe recalls that justice has not been done enough.
"We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice in particular," Brooks said.
"Until then, the healing and reconciliation process cannot be initiated."
The medical examiner covers one of the victims of the lynching at Moore's Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI files that received NBC News, lynching was to be attended by up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding districts.
However, no one has yet been prosecuted.
Although suspects remain free for decades, civil rights advocates claim that both causes of lynching - politics and sex - have been known to all the inhabitants of the city.
In April 1946, on the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court, the inhabitants of the black skin of the state of Georgia received the first ever right to participate in the elections scheduled for the summer.
And it was during the summer election that, according to the FBI, the farmer had Roger Malcom's black skin during the fight to stab the landowners of Barnett Hester's white skin - allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, Hester used to train Malcom’s wife, Dorothy, and bring her to another condition.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the then important owner of the land of Loy Harrison's white skin for Malcolm's $600 bail.
Dorothy and cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey escorted him to prison.
On their way back from prison, just before they entered Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects covered their way.
"As it turned out, he planned the murders and organized Harrison," the FBI said.
“It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement officials who not only participated in the lynching but also disposed of the evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks made a brief statement on the whole matter.
"It was a massacre because of election law," he said.
"The killings had a clear subtext for all the locals of black skin: 'you will get this if you register and you go to vote."
The annual reconstruction of the Moore's Ford Bridge event is organized by Cassandra Greene for nearly ten years.
Her performance is vivid, entrenched and prestigious, showing deep-rooted racism, which many would like to see as extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy, and it is even more difficult to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"Nobody wants to talk about lynching, because in doing so we have to face the unpleasant feelings that lie in each one of us," Greene said.
"But we can't have a relationship if you don't listen to what I had to go through."
The main tests of this year's reconstruction began in June and on the first day, approximately 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest of blacks - gathered into the room where Greene introduced her very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is taking the position of assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of Kukluxklan, but according to him, the role is exhausting.
"It makes me feel bad because it opposes who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it's very important to remind ourselves of this part of history regularly, because we never want to return to that time."
Hercs Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom, including Barnett Hester, practice their roles.
The show starts with a fight - Malcolm is arguing with Hester and he blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my property!
There's no Rascona.
There's a fight.
At that moment all (at least every actor in black skin) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
“No”, Greene’s joy will be answered.
"I just don't think white people used to say 'n-r' that kind of tone at the time."
“Exactly”, one of the actors in black skin will snort.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
Energy in the room is all of a sudden better; hostility will replace a sense of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to be done for enough of the four victims of the massacre.
Actors repeat the scene.
Rascona's emphasis this time is on the correct pronunciation of the word N.
No one laughs now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Screaming, gunshots... and silence.
A woman dressed in black stands above the bodies of actors and sings Billie Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
With every word, there's sadness in the room.
In the background of all this, about a dozen spectators shed their sweat and tears from their eyes.
In the audience is practically the same number of blacks and whites.
One couple traveled all the way from New York Ithaca, many watching them from nearby.
Each of them endures a local wet climate for nearly eight hours and Brooks is in the crowd leading to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until this moment, homicides could have been viewed with distance, but now, standing in the same place where lynching happened, the atmosphere is terrifying.
In the last few words, Greene's song will be summoned by a crowd watching for inspection of the bodies.
Children kneel to their victims ’ heads, follow false blood, and motionless bodies, whispering in their ears.
"They're not dead," the little boy jerks.
He'll run for a few minutes and Greene'll thank the audience.
Actors clean ropes and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona will embrace his two actors' friends and cry in their arms; in the end, he'll get emotional.
“It’s okay,” whispers one of the women.
“We know that your roles are falling apart.
But you had a reason to."
Later that day, he meets the audience together with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple are busy talking about a show with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could barely find words that would express her feelings from today's performance.
"It is difficult to listen to the ugly words and to look at the ugly deeds... performed by people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said to the reconstruction.
"It makes me want to realize that lynching is still a topic," she added, "just called police fights".
On the other side of the room is Tyrone Brooks in the courtroom, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he has already begun to plan the show for the next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring, since it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think," he said.
"If we don't learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it."
I love the instructions to use.
A friend of mine says that the instructions for use are only for use by the shrape.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It's one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia, I remember a time long ago where the instructions to use anything were more of a raid.
So, for example, my first record player contained just one piece of paper on which the hieroglyphics depicting the involvement of some parts, all of which had some secret markings.
After years of breaking something inside, I offered it to a shaman who wasn't afraid to scrape off the backboard.
He told me with a grin, what's the use of that lab paper?
Yes, it was the usual help for chronic toilet paper depilation.
He found a hot wire and allowed me to listen again to expensive vinyl cookies.
A new era has brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where a broken grape was simply held, required about ten images.
Especially guided was a sketch describing how to insert one part into the other.
The arrangement was twofold and another procedure was simply not possible.
The reverse required considerable effort with the need to break down certain plastic parts.
My contempt for instructions ended at my self-inflicted Seat Leon brand.
The year 2003 had such a book with instructions for minor repairs, among which was the exchange of the light bulb of the blinker.
It was simple.
A total of three steps and work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the instructions warned that while the bulb on the right went to replace really only in three steps.
One, take the cover.
2. Blow out the cracked bulb and roll a new one.
Take cover three.
The bulb on the left had a problem in the form of a battery cover.
At first, I thought that by pushing the right upper end into the belly of the car I would find some spring, screws which that cover would easily move away and then I would drive points 1-3 of the savings author of the service book.
The error of the bench.
The cover had no place, no space for the soft hand of Cinderella, not for the obese Silesian.
I've lost half an hour of my life, completely without success.
The condition was further strengthened by the entrance of my wife to the garage which the roar and the words which from my mouth heard exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked helplessly.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I leave out the vulgar term, there were only two published words left.
I'm changing the bulb.
"And why is it taking you so long?" she said with a sentence that could be her last in a long-term union.
I slowly explained the problem, with the emphasis on the procedure of torture by the author of the manual, where blessing with the burning iron on her hands, which the guide wrote, after her embodiment, so that she could never write anything again, was a mere introduction to the wide range of instructions by Kladiva on the witch, including his commissional burning at the top of the Losin Castle.
"How about we unplug the box?" the woman thought of installing the battery.
In clear despair it happened and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought I couldn't be surprised.
Until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just discussing the collapse situation after checking two offices of the State Drug Control Department.
I know him as a colleague who has experienced the impossible in the field and who can tell wild stories with an unsettled voice.
"Just pretend I got a ticket for not having my hand washed instructions posted," he said in a weak voice.
Gradually, I overcome the entire problem, which was that there is no picture guide over the washbasin in the patient’s toilet.
His arguments to the commission office that adults wash their hands generally can and that they do not need icons to handle the normal activity of decent people, had no healing effect and cost him little money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple washing of soapy hands with running water was a primitive act at the level of Cromanche that man modern, Homo sapiens sapiens, performed this ceremony in ten steps.
Then it must be said that water must be released from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but in the end, it is a joy to find that man washed his hands exactly as the landlord of SUKL ordered.
Finally, I must point out that I have been inspired and am preparing a detailed plan of action for the toilet.
In the matter of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will not be a problem, in the case of urinating, given the difference between the two sexes, it will be necessary to hang instructions two.
The problem remains these icons, because creating the perfect process also means an accurate drawing of all the anatomic details, which could arouse a certain disturbance in the basement visitor's toilet, despite the fact that he can finally find out that he had wiped out the proper opening with a completely flawed procedure throughout his life.
Pearson will release another 3000 employees and reduce dividends in order to revive trade
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it would release another 3000 employees and reduce the provisional dividend by 72 per cent in response to another restructuring programme in order to change the business model.
Another wave of release, which according to Executive Director John Fallon will take place at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019, follows the previous decision of the company to release 4000 employees in the context of previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to reduce costs by another £300 million ($394 million) in May under the third programme to reduce costs in order to resurrect declining trade due to the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which agreed to sell its share in the Bertelsmann Penguin Random House last month, stated that the outlook for this year remained unchanged after it announced a one-percent increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldiers killed in a suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul. In the attack, a NATO soldier died and several others were injured, officials reported.
Five soldiers and interpreters were injured, according to NATO.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians also died during the Qarabagh attack in the city district.
This month, Afghanistan struck a bomb attack - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in an explosion in a Croatian mosque.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO stated in its statement that Tuesday's explosion occurred after the patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by a "local person with a home made by an explosive device".
The statement further states that all wounded soldiers are out of danger of life and are in the US military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
According to the rapporteurs, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh area is a significant source of concerns by NATO Allied Forces in the near Bagrama.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of the victims died in the capital.
At the end of July, a bomb placed in a car killed at least 30 people in the district of Shia, Kabul.
The Taliban has applied for the attack.
On May 31st, a major explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people, the most lethal militant attack in the country since the US troops overthrowd the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence is undermining the already questionable situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering an increase in the number of American soldiers who should assist military forces and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, the suicide attacks he committed in recent weeks were shaken by the confidence of the public in the government, its regulation and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanín.
EPA re-examined its decision to distance smoking rules
The US Environmental Protection Agency has withdrawn its decision to postpone Obama's administration law, which has ordered States to reduce emissions, only a day after 15 states have sued the Agency.
The EPA, at mid-night intervals, announced its decision on the ‘Ozone Standards 2015’ follow-up with the words ‘the Agency’s commitment to cooperate with the States’.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and we will hear their views," said EPA Director Scott Pruitt in his statement.
Pruitt announced in June an effort by the EPA to phase out ozone standards - which measure real air pollution in specific areas of the country and, on the basis of measurements, set limits that need to be met by October 2018.
The group of fifteen of the majority of the democratic states, together with Washington, D.C., filed an action Tuesday on the grounds that EPA is illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration seeks to prevent many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama, according to Trump's words, in an effort to boost economic growth.
However, the efforts of the new government have launched counter-measures by Democrats and conservative groups, which fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA notes on its website that air breathing with ozone “may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnar got shot and he was bleeding!
This, with us quite a new singer, you may have already registered in June this year, when this almost unknown singer arranged for the Czech proportions of a monstrous event hosted by such leading personalities as Master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was not moderated by anyone other than Leoš Maresh.
The purpose was simple, to show myself to the public and to introduce my music video to Sara, whose baptism was hosted by the newly appointed person.
Few people already know that the video clip that took place in Russia did not work without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnar himself had to be treated.
It was his first big movie with the stars of the Russian National Ballet, and it didn't go without a real knockout.
Sara's song is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the dramaticness of the scene, the singer's video clip would indicate a blow to the face.
At one point, however, he was struck so hard and right in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a morning, I didn't expect it, immediately blood came out of my nose," Ladislav commented.
Colleagues and producers told themselves that it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav was unable to react in time.
Fortunately, the injuries were not so serious as to affect the continuation of the filming.
We're bringing you the video of a young artist, and you can record the impact scene in it.
Unprovoked version with blood, however, has not been used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasil Lomachenko spoke at a meeting on the possibilities of mutual duel
Vasil Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two fighters who could stage the most intense boxing match in a light vase, met for the first time at Tuesday's meeting.
Each of them was located in a separate room in the offices of the ESPN in Los Angeles, until Garcia - the undefeated champion in the light vase of the World Boxing Council - sat down in the hall where he welcomed the Lomachenko, the champion in the feather vase of the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's match for Showtime, both boxers got on the list of the top five boxers in a light vase.
Garcia pulled his right hand and said: “How are you doing, champ?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends the title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on Saturday at 7: 00 p.m.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager of the Lomchenka Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxing match would be a “perfect test”.
“I am a former champion in a penis vase,” Garcia adds.
“I had to pick up because of my struggle with Broner (67 kg), but I’m not that big.
I'm a little small on my 63 kg.
I'd like to go back to the category of light weight.
The breaker has to pull over again to get on a light scale... then we can meet.
He's after the fan.
Why don't you do it to them?"
The breaker agrees.
"This fight will benefit the box."
Klimas made a demand for payment for consideration - which is part of his strategy. Lomačenko should graduate his debut in a light vase at the end of this year and next year meet Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the match against the winner Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who meet on September 23rd for the title in the Light Vase in the Forum.
“The match should take place in the style of the payout, it is demanded by fans,” said Garcia, who later said that it is open to broadcast the game through the television station, which comes with the best offer.
"We are the main attraction.
No one else can draw that kind of attention to themselves.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said that he recognized Lomachenko as a "amazing boxer" and could participate in his Saturday match.
But he didn't give Garcia the credit when he said that the champion of the three Divisions of Riverside looked "very slow... sorry Mike, but you're talking about knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers said they felt a rising tension in front of each other's duel.
"You won't forget about this game.
No other fight will draw so much attention to itself.
And I will put great joy in the fire," Garcia said.
He said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It's gonna be a great match."
A young couple 12 years ago disappeared without a trace.
Their car was just found at Volga's bottom.
Two young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov were missing since December 2005.
There was a widespread search for them, but without success.
And the police ended the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they would never know what had happened to them.
After 12 years, a sad ending to the whole story came.
Vrak found their car a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in Cheboksary, Chuvask.
Only thanks to the documents that were left in the car did the officers manage to identify a few.
The evidence survived the entire decade underwater, without which it would take the police much longer to find out the identity of those found.
A couple were last seen when Jirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his findings to the cheddar police, who pulled the car out to the beach the next day.
The investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a frozen road leading around the river.
However, the investigation continues and further details will be published after it is completed.
Latest results of tests to establish the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of the tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to a new method of assessing their age, show that over 80 percent of people were questioned as older than 18 years, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (Röttsmedicinallverket) began to carry out new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to evaluate applicants in the context of the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the right age for some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6,880 cases and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published a total of 2,481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) was assessed as 18 years of age, while in another 25 cases, the Forensic Medical Agency considered the question to be “maybe 18 years of age. ”
In the next 423 cases, it was decided that the question was “maybe under 18 years of age”.
The tests shall be taken only if the age of the survey is contested.
According to Johan Gósransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond with the previous month.
"In contrast to last month, the statistics are kept in running tracks and the numbers are very similar," said The Local.
The higher number of applicants whose age was estimated at over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that “the person concerned is 18 years of age or older”.
Svenska Dagbladet's newspaper investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the interrogator said he would be 18 this year.
Critics were also faced with a medical method of age that includes an X-ray of the teeth of wisdom and an MRI scan of the knee joints, which the dentists and X-rays then assess.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, deals with the assessment of the biological maturity of people to determine the age of puberty in question.
“I had reason to think about this issue, and I do not think that these types of measurement for age assessment are right.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we can't determine age with accuracy, we shouldn't pretend otherwise," Metro said.
The forensic medical agency Agency's Gósransson defended the decision by saying: “It can usually be said that the risk of misjudgement of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person questioned is below the limit of 18 years, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all the questions asked."
Trump threatened the President of Mexico on the phone.
US President Donald Trump, in his January call to Mexican President Enrique Peña, threatened that he would not meet him if he publicly said that his country would not pay for the construction of the wall between the United States and Mexico.
Trump said in the interview that funding would somehow be arranged, even though he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This comes from transcripts of interviews published by The Washington Post, U.S.A., on Thursday.
Trump built a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
Immediately in the first interview with the Mexican President shortly after taking up the function of Trump Peña, Nieto was undiplomatically punishing for being critical of his plan to build a wall.
He identified the South Neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican President not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," Trump said repeatedly in a conversation from January 27th, and threatened to interrupt contact with the Mexican President if he continues to make hateful statements.
The funding seems to come up with something, and it's going to work out.
"But if you say Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you gentlemen anymore because it's unacceptable to me," said the American daily Trump.
The wall is the least important thing we're talking about, but politically, it's probably the most important thing.
The executive order to build the Trump wall issued shortly after the takeover.
Mexico’s construction and financing of the wall for a length of 3,200 kilometres are denied, and the relations of both countries have also deteriorated.
At the end of March, Trump said the project would be paid by the United States for the time being.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 Summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also informed about Trump's telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull from January 28th.
The White House chief calls conversation ridiculous.
This was the conclusion of the exchange of views on the agreement under which Australia will provide asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States accepting persons from boarding facilities in the Pacific islands.
Trump considered the deal stupid at first, but later he joined it.
"You can certainly say this is not an agreement you have made, but you will have to stick to it," Trump Turnbull said.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost ghastly, for example, when Trump appreciated as a good idea the Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, however, the tone of the conversation grew stronger.
"I hate receiving these people," Trump noted.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They won't be great people who go to work for local dairy," he said.
In the interview, he also pointed out that a fugitive could become an assassin from Boston in five years.
Trump led at the end of January, about a week after arriving at the White House, telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen, often several in one day.
In the end, the call with Turnbull called it the least pleasant one all day.
Before he finished, he pointed out that he had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier.
They executed Rana's killer before the crowd.
Her father was watching too.
The execution took place on the square in the capital city of Yemen Sana.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose Rana Almatari as his victim, who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped a girl, took her father's house, raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
Then he raped her body, which he then dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a young girl hit the entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood first of the thousand - minded crowd who met to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was sentenced under Shariah's law.
The victim's father gave the media his feelings after he was executed.
I feel reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's the new day of my life.
The other members of the family were present, together with the crowd, shouting, "Let justice live."
The thug on the square brought a police van from which he was pulled.
The officers tied him to his stomach.
One of the members turned his weapon against him and fired from the immediate vicinity.
The present crowd celebrated every wound that was burned.
Mr al Almatari told the MailOnline website that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Shariah's right won," he added.
I was standing in the square of liberation in Sanaa waiting for the execution of my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's tiny calf and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
Me and my wife Jamileh are grateful that justice was done.
The police were afraid that a crowd gathered on the square would be destroyed by hateful madness, the killer would fall and lynching.
The execution was ordered by a court under the administration of the Shia Hutsi.
Initially, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 wounds with whips immediately after his arrest, but his act aroused such a stir that the judge decided on the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27th.
Rana's family knew him well.
When the police searched the basement of his house, they discovered evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almaari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to the wound.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injury that carried Rana's body was terrifying," he told the media.
"The morning went missing this afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our television stations, posters with her picture hung everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the murderous parents who suspected their son of a terrible act.
The girl’s mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter’s body had been found.
The wound was playing out with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we searched in vain.
Yemeni residents were defiled and began to gather in front of the police station where al Maghrabi was held and to demand immediate punishment.
The representative of the Ministry of Justice read to the present crowd a record of the investigation to calm them down.
The accused apparently showed no remorse over his act.
Just before the execution, the officers read him the verdict, but the convict looked at his executioner.
The entire event was filmed for national television, but there were many recordings on the Internet that the crowd had recorded.
West Virginia governor announces political party change
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening at President Trump's meeting that he was moving to another side.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," said the Governor of Justice.
"Today after a long prayer and meditation I tell you ... today as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer support you from the position of democratic governor."
A crowd of spectators burst into joy.
"I will apply to the republics tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump had previously promised important announcements to people at a convention in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and owns several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee, meanwhile on Thursday evening, issued a statement stating: “The Governor Justice's misdemeanor is another morning for a democratic party that puts obstacles in our way instead of causing our country to rise."
"For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls at least the legislative authorities in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is the last drop for an already poor party without a leader who is vainly seeking to find a positive and unifying report," RNC President Ronna McDaniel said in her statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's "honest" apology for the doping scandal
Former athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for sincerely apologizing for the doping scandal, but reiterated that the time had not yet come for Russia to return to the sports world.
Russian Athletics chief Dmitry Sylahtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which was held in the eve of MS in athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the sport world was right and that it is determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who thus lost gold and silver medals. ”
Despite its comments, the members of the IAAF Congress voted in favour of preserving the ban which entered into force in November 2015 after the report of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) concluded that Russia supported the doping of its athletes.
"I think we have witnessed very sincere answers and presentations today," President IAAF Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia has admitted its error and is working through every effort to correct and restore the proper function of the entire Federation."
Coe said that he was also “satisfyed” that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been very successful and we have stepped up to the next level, but Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis staff on the retention of the sentence that was imposed on Russia," Coe added.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our effort has always been to separate honest athletes from the dishonest," he ended his speech.
On the MS in athletics, which starts on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under the neutral flag, who have fulfilled the strict rules of the IAEAF.
The head of the IAAF crisis staff, Run Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet several criteria before it was allowed back.
Tests on the presence of drugs are still inadequate and exclusions coaches continue to operate, told reporters in London after the presentation of the IAAF Council.
The CzechTrade's state contract was awarded to František Sava, whose state is prosecuting.
The public contract of the state export agency CzechTrade was awarded by the publisher Mladá Fronta Františka Savava.
Officials gave him 100 percent of the points in all quality criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state is prosecuting Sava for tax fraud and asking for his release to the Czech Republic.
The Export Agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the CzechTrade issued a public contract for four years providing editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal in April.
The total contract of CZK 30.8 million was awarded by Young Company of the entrepreneur Františka Savava.
The Czech police have already accused the Czech police of tax evasion in 2014 and is pursuing him on the run.
Savav has fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic is asking for his release.
The current.cz server alerted the case.
According to the original CzechTrade criteria, the price offered and the remaining 40 beauty contests were expected to be 60 percent of the price offered, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion greatly helped Saul’s firm.
According to information, Dotik.cz received 100 points in all sub-criteria of quality.
That is what moved her in the result before another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, who offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated on 404,900 crown a month, VLM offered 324,350 crowns.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it received 62 points from the assessors in all quality criteria of the sub-average rating.
Tendru also participated in BDO Advisory and digital agency R-Media, which falls as well as the server Aktuno.cz under the publisher Economia.
VLM submitted several objections against the result of the tendre, in that its evaluation is considered unfair and insufficiently justified.
Following their rejection, the Commission decided to attack competition at the ÚOHS Competition Protection Authority.
The CzechTrade is believed to have acted contrary to the law.
"The applicant is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of a supplier of a public contract based on the risk of subjective evaluation, clearly favouring the participant Mladá Fronta, a.s., at the expense of the applicant and other suppliers," the proposal for the initiation of the proceedings filed at the ÚHS this week, which was published by the server Currently, states.
According to the Director-General and Chairman of the VLM Board, Michal Klím, the scoring of the selection commission appears to be an incredible and 100% evaluation of the Young Front project for all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors unlikely and suspicious," Klima said.
CzechTrade has yet to comment on the situation.
The CzechTrade Agency does not fundamentally comment on public contracts before they are concluded.
In accordance with the law, all information on you are published in the Contractor's Profile and in the Public Procurement Journal.
"After the conclusion of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract we cannot express ourselves to the duration of the contract," the media representative of the agency Štěpán Dluhý said for Dotik.cz.
The young front responded with a statement that considers it extremely problematic that the publishers of Economia hit the Article in Aktual.cz in a competition where they have their own business interests.
However, this fact was mentioned in the article mentioned above.
In the tender, she could be helped by the fact that she was the one who provided BusinessInfo editorial services in the previous four years.
The contract was first competed in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led Martim Cuba ODS.
Františka Sava blames the police for tax evasion in connection with the excessive VAT deductions of its companies, which have caused the Czech state alleged damage to up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK to issue it since 2014.
According to Saviov, the chief of the movement ANO Andrej Babish, whose influence is the publishing company Mafra, is behind his criminalization.
Last year, the London court rejected Savav's appeal against the release, but the businessman declined.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, from Great Britain, in the matter of gaining legal power, we have not yet obtained any understanding," Štěpánka Zenklová, a spokesman for the Prague City State Department, said.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savav in the company Harvestor Limited, based in Cyprus, controlled by the Czechoslovakian brewery Samson, and in the Cyprus company Maraflex, which ranks as an investment fund that purchases endangered assets.
He should also control the failing Heavy Machinery Services, formerly the Legions, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savav was also linked to the withdrawal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The motorbike drove down the sidewalks and the park, ended up in cotmels.
The motorbike drew attention to himself by recklessly driving on the streets, sidewalks and park roads in Úšovice.
When the guards chased him, he decided to take her to the Station.
"Police officers followed the city with increased caution when, on one side of the road to Mariana Spa, he failed to drive and with a motorcycle entered the field where he crashed," said police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
Finally, a rescue helicopter had to arrive, transporting the injured motorist to a crawling hospital.
After the police found out that the biker's own driver's license, registration plates on the motorcycle were cut off, his production number cut and the production plate itself removed.
It's so possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"The breath test carried out on the spot the presence of alcohol in the driver was excluded, but a positive result was found for the substance methamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
How the financial rules of football affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs will not prejudice Neymar's record crossing from Spain's Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalisation for Paris Saint-Germain will be carried out by the EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Lize Masters.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules introduced by the UEFA in 2011 provide that the PSG will have to prove that Neymar’s transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million only to buy Neymar out of his contract, and Neymar will demand a payment of several tens of millions of dollars per year.
Following are several financial conditions of Neymar’s transfer to France.
Since the PSG team is funded by a wealthy Qatari family that has made a fortune selling energy, it can allow Neymar to bring into the already-star football family.
Clubs may spend huge sums on buying players, but on the other hand they have to prove the legal sources of income, which allows them to cover the direct costs of football-related business activities.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after being put into the chair of the Director of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that in pursuit of the new forces were ultimately deceiving and risking bankruptcy if the banks or owners refused to provide them.
In 2011 she rerouted the rules of FFP her attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovic with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and to lose the upper sums for players and build a global brand - was suddenly not so advantageous.
Within the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs may lose up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Alexander Čeferin is determined to defend the ban on excessive spending.
"The rules of the FFP are still valid and we are determined to strengthen them in the future," said Associated Press Andrea Traverso last week, who oversees compliance with the rules of the FFP.
Although the PSG has paid the sum for buying Neymar in one-time payment, it may, for the purposes of accounting, spread the amount over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to EUR 44.4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions hit PSG in 2014 together with Manchester City, owned by Abu Dhabi.
PSG took a fine of EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and a order to reduce the team of the Champions League to 21 players in the season 2014-2015, instead of 25 players.
UEFA takes care of teams that may attempt to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through clubs’ owners.
Therefore, even though the Qatari company is sponsoring PSG once the funding exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the calculation of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
According to some reports, part of Neymar’s income in PSG could be compensated by the MS Organising Commission in the 2022 pitch in Qatar.
However, the PSG and the representatives of MS 2022 in Qatar denied fat that it should be possible for it to become an ambassador to MS in football and that such a manoeuvre would be easily revealed by UEFY actors.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to Tuesday's expressed dedicated persons, UEFA did not launch any investigations into Neymar's transition to PSG.
The source of this report wanted to remain anonymous, as it was not entitled to comment with PSG, said the Associated Press.
The latest published accounts show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with net profit of EUR 10 million and turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and selling jerseys.
The Club promises to increase turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
The representatives of the Spanish league, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to appease Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would violate the rules of FFP.
“This is a clear case of ‘financial doping’ of both the club and the state,” stated President la League Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to ownership of the PSG Club by the Qatari syndicate.
The manager of Arsenal Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports magnate, shares the same La League position on funding the club.
"This is the consequence of ownership which has changed the football world from the ground in the last 15 years," Wenger heard on Thursday.
"As soon as he becomes the owner of the club, anything is possible.
Compliance with financial fair play rules is very difficult because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
The Spartan magazine Rosický: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tomáš Rosický is going to the square.
Same scene as the Sunday game against the Bohemians.
The Spartan publisher moved against the Red Star game, invented several goals, but his teammates did not move to the black.
The flight team, pumped with new multimillions of power, ends with the initial double charge in the European Cups.
Was it hard to do anything else after the Belgrade goal?
After the scored goal, four shots had to be fired, which was hard for us.
At least we didn't want to lose, raise our confidence so that we could have something to resist in other games.
We had a chance.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why couldn't Sparta get into the fight so long?
The game is very busy.
The rival combination was much better than ours.
We didn't get to anything, we shot once in half.
Of course, that's very little if you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, in the final third we were able to play with them.
But you have to push your opponent into such positions more often.
Is there a problem with a large number of changes in the composition?
Of course, it's one of the pains of forming a new manhood.
We've only played three games, and the composition is still changing.
It's about the coach finding the perfect 11 who's sitting down.
Is it encouraging to you that you've already won part of two games each other?
It's still just part of the game.
I don't know how my condition will develop and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, or we can't be.
It's the same as the injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has decided somehow, we have to be optimistic, or the situation will get worse.
The fans came again in great numbers, but they left in despair.
What can you tell them?
Once again, there was an amazing visit, just like with Bohemia.
I'm terribly sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Show off something that'll come next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember seeing people like that when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups at least be an advantage for the league?
So far, we're fighting ourselves, we're playing games, so it's not an advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur is to be held for ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected Jiří Toman’s complaint, which is expected to be imposed on him for a substantial reduction of his tax in prison for ten years.
The estimated damage is 645 million crowns.
In his complaint, Toman claimed that his trial violated his fundamental rights, and that the actual findings of the Zlina and Olomouc courts were incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Court found that the complaint was unfounded and found out from the Court's database.
The ÚS is not another appeal court.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, assess the factual or legal doubts which the general courts allegedly have committed if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution reads.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in the custody of Argentina, where according to the resolution he was also at the time of the decision.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage caused.
The Supreme Court considered the case to be an extreme tax evasion, which has up to a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man acted from 2005 to 2008 as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Service.
The damage of CZK 645 million occurred only from January to July 2008, the total loss according to the expert exceeded a billion.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the whole amount.
According to the indictment, World Service did not include all the invoices in its tax returns.
At least tens of millions of crowns paid taxes in just a few months instead of monthly VAT and excise taxes.
World Service and some companies with which the company was trading have a relationship with Radomír Víbírál, who has been tried for VAT fraud in the 13-year prison market.
His complaint was also rejected before the Constitutional Court of Justice.
Nostalgic String Series “A Summer for Survival” and “Comrade Detective”
This iteration of the story is nostalgic both for the characters of the famous 80s; and for the dirty 90s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the MTV comedy sketch “The State”); and, of course, even for modern times, 2001 specifically, the stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd started to make bigger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and also the embodiment of our modern facebook era of lasting memories.
From the French's point of view, it seems someone's out of breath.
The series “First Day of Camp” worked surprisingly well – not only because of absurd humor (for example, the story of the creation of a talking can with vegetables, which H. Jon Benjamin called).
The authors deviated from the main funny point - middle-aged actors who play horny teens - and could not pull back from previous events.
The continuation of “This Years Later” in which adults play adults does not push so much on emotional plane and satire is a sporadic place, including parody on thrillers from the 1990s as “Hand on the cradle”.
At one point, the figure finds the Apple Powerbook, wheel skates, and “posting other things from 1991” on the pile of haraburds.
Many of the main story lines repeat themselves.
The benevolent Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, has still not moved over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), which is encouraged by George H. W. Bush (very well-occupied Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of franchises are many side stories.
Especially amusing is watching an eternal young Rudd with long hair alias Matt Dillon's character from the film Youth, whose once respectable character Andy is now behind the old pepper.
Francis could start the moments of random madness, such as the coming back series “Seven Up” until he reaches what I assume will be the logical outrage: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later”, when in the last scene the whole group will be released to the premiere “Let's Not Survive”.
“Comrade Detective” on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to another type of nostalgia: the Revivalism of the Cold War of the series “So Normal Americans”, the film “Atomic Blonde: No Regrets” and even the series “GLOW”, in which icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scenes collide.
The comedy of creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka, directed by Rhyse Thomas, is to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest police officers from Romania in the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the tough Gregor and idealistic Iosefa - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Street, which acquired the English language Channing Tatum (the executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
For some jokes you laugh (like cops watching chess on TV - parody on American football).
The show was loaned by many famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali and Chloe Sevigny.
But the "Comrade Detective" is too focused on the insatiable propaganda drama - which includes the killer with Reagan's mask - and it also seems to be.
Six long episodes are too dreary and comedy moments aren't enough.
In a shorter investigation, the propaganda satire at the "Comrade Detective" could work, such as in the scene of Gregor and Iosef repeatedly attending the US Embassy, in which the two fatters are swallowing hamburgers based on a large crowd.
A clear message for the imaginary communist community is that Western culture can transform everything into food and orgy.
The ideas of Romanian creators were not wrong: we do so with our own culture as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes have not received the lifting of the IAAF start-up ban.
The International Athletics Federation of the IAAF at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on Russian racers' start-ups due to the state-supported doping programme.
The vote in the history of the world championship, which starts on Friday, was very clear as expected.
In order to extend the ban, 166 delegates were issued, with only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is the fact that Russia is unable to meet all requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, as IAAF Special Investigation Group Run Andersen noted before the congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some of the older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspicious athletes have not yet been heard and trainers with their reputations are still working in the country.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency is not fully operational yet, nor is the Russian Anti-Doping Agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
However, RUSADA can conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Although progress has been made, much work still needs to be done," said President IAAF Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athletic federation was suspended in November 2015, Russian athletes thus lost, among other things, the last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on the upcoming MS participating 19 Russians who had already proved that they had been tested for longer outside the Russian anti-doping system.
But they won't be able to start in national colors at the championship, and if they win, they won't be able to play the Russian anthem.

The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following a sharp economic growth and weakening of inflation, which has stifled speculation about rapid growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain “in the background” in order to maintain the interest rate - despite family budget expectations.
The policyholders of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six to two to maintain an interest rate of 0.25 %. The results of the vote in favour of an increase in the interest rate supported unexpressive economic growth supported by a weak increase.
In its Annual Inflation Report, the Bank forecast to grow to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the reduction of family budgets will continue. The Bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that growth should take place as a result of the inflation caused by Brexit over the next few years, and also stated that the volume rent should increase more than expected in the financial markets.
The members of the Committee also voted in favour of downloading part of the mammoth package, which was designed to support the economy and which was put into practice a year ago as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, as of next February, the Bank of England should start paying the termable funding plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, although the Bank of England has stated that it will now offer £15 billion less compared to the US$ 115 billion planned.
Just prior to the decision, the bank stated: ‘MPC predicts that the gross domestic product (GDP) will be withdrawn in the short term, together with the pressure on real household income and the burden of consumption.’
On the subject of the rates, the bank stated that it would be necessary to "tract the bonds of monetary policy" in order to calm inflation, "to a greater extent" than the markets expect.
Markets currently predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and further increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "slow" and "limited".
The Bank reduced growth forecast for this year and next year compared to 1,9 % and 1,7 % forecast in May.
Estimated growth in 2018 of 1.8% remained unchanged.
After the release of estimates, a pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.31 dollars and by 0.4 % to 1.11 euros.
The decision to maintain the current situation came after a disappointing rise in hopes of further growth: GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter compared to 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0,3 % in the third quarter, although the bank is expected to increase slightly by the end of the year.
The latest report on inflation is an insignificant comfort for households affected by rising inflation and poor wage increases. The bank said that the situation will worsen before the increase.
The report further states that monetary policy cannot "prevent" a reduction in revenue in the coming years, but wages are expected to "express" towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow due to a high interest in British goods due to weak libre, which will compensate for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after last August's rates were reduced to 0.025 % in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, resulting in a decline in pounds.
The Bank estimates that the full unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Prior to the Bank's decision at the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates along with rising inflation, which was growing pressure on households. Three political actors demanded a 0.5% increase in June.
Inflation last month fell back to 2.6 % of June 2,9 %, even though the bank indicated that it expected such a change and that inflation should rise again during the next month.
The Bank stated that the overcoming relative to 2 % of the target was ‘total’ due to weak pounds.
Andrew Montlake, director of the Coreco Mortage Brokers, stated: “Because of the recent fall of swap rates, it seems that competition on the mortgage market will only rise as soon as creditors start competing for contracts with a view to a good outlook at the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end existing contracts and return mortgages - there are no fees available in the offer, as well as the low rates they receive at their favourite."
NHS prescribes a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
Patients have been given access to “transformative” treatment for HIV prevention since September on the basis of the Supreme Court's decision to fund NHS.
The English National Health Service (NSH) has announced that pre-exposure propylaxis (PREP) pill used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent will be offered through health care to approximately 10,000 patients during a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the Court of Appeal supported the decision of last year's Supreme Court, stating that the NHS has the funds to pay for the PreEP despite the declaration that the drug should be financed by the local authorities.
The decision, announced on Thursday, was taken by NHS England from the mouth of Director General Simon Stevens as a ‘significant intervention’ while National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a ‘decision moment’.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Further clinics will be joined in October and full implementation across England will take place by April 2018.
Pre-exposure propylaxis (PREP) is an HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV.
The tests showed that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among patients at risk.
PreEP before sex means that there are enough specific medicines in the patient’s body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Tested patients include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and people with HIV positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics shall identify eligible participants who will sign consent to participate in testing, including men, women, transsexual people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with the GP in the UK can also apply to their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program comes taxpayers for £10 million and NHS England signed a drug distribution contract this week after obtaining an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PreEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should complement and fully burden constantly expanding and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than 30 years of trying to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, National Aids Trust, said: “We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PREP is administered correctly and patients are at risk, it will offer an opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
NSH will offer patients who are exposed to a high risk of HIV infection from September a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and is not subject to the need to persuade a partner, which will improve the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure.'
Ian Green, the executive director of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘Prioritium number one must be a rapid test deployment throughout the country; we need to make it available to every patient.
We now have a test drug of PrEP and we are on a good way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.'
Shadow’s Minister of Health Sharon Hodgson said: “The beginning of the trial period of PreEP is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and government restraint.
The evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the end of transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The following tests will lead us to a step closer to a full understanding of the PreEP benefits.
It is now important that we begin tests throughout the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and thus end the spread of HIV in society together.'
Life on a high foot: Between the floor and smart design turned this small apartment into Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with passion for real estate, exchanged a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment at Earls Cour in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne's smart terrace - and is an overview of modern design that uses the maximum space available.
"Before, I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge," Joanne said.
“I was looking for something more reasonable.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and had the same height ceiling.
I fell in love with him right away, and that very day I nodded to him."
Since then, he's been through an apartment of 1,000 square meters of complete remodeling.
The one-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - wanted Joanne to add the storage spaces and the interstory to use the high ceiling.
“I longed for a high ceiling, large windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi from the design and design studio Duck & Shed, based in Notting Hill, and used the four-meter ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such heights as to climb two gaps - a challenge for architects, so it was possible to create an interstory on which to walk directly.
Erfan must have involved his creative thinking.
‘The steel structure is completely complicated,’ he explained.
“We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but at the same time bend the steel structure so that it was at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to build two full-fledged rooms on himself - while adding to the drama.
On the interstory overlooks the beautiful living room of the old copper window frame in the design of Retrouvius.
Mirror furniture in gold, silver lines and retro chandelier Serge Mouille create a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is covered with mirrors on both sides, and it looks so long.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to another room.
At the entrance door there are storage spaces provided with mirrors to store accessories and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a much larger space, is to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
The folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique about this solution is the folding door.
“We had to solve the technical page,” Erfan says about the reinforced arched doors.
"The doors are equipped with counter-insistence to be very easy."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage facilities, Joanne gained another 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes to this, what you are selling is a residential area - or appreciation of your property," Erfan said.
‘The real estate broker shall, essentially, calculate his price on the basis of the living space.’
In this case, it was possible to increase the living space while maintaining quality materials that provide the space of luxurious appearance.
"The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home," Erfan added.
“You will not love the divorce of electricity in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your hearts do not gain."
As it turns out, the quality design and expansion of the living space can transform an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is disintegrating.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on the travel of its citizens to Tennessee and the other seven states.
Tennessee paid her back and ordered her to go to California for her citizens' travel.
Of course, it is not a ban in the full sense, the citizens of the United States can travel freely after all 50 states.
It is that California has forbidden to spend state money on its citizens' travels to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strong for LGBT, and any expression of non-conformity with the LGBT lifestyle considers discrimination.
However, Tennessee has adopted a law on conscientious objection, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the treatment of patients from the LGBT community has no obligation to provide it, but has an obligation to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have adopted laws under which religious charity organizations, which have received children from mothers after birth to adoption, do not have the obligation to provide adoptions to the same sex couples.
Because of these conscientious objection laws, California has banned the financing of its citizens' travel to eight EU states from its means.
In practice, this means that California's professors must not have a path to scientific symposiums, for example in Texas, paid by their universities, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with financial support from their schools.
On their journeys they must obtain either federal grants, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance the travel of citizens from State A to State B, or private sponsorship.
Tennessee has become patient, and its parliament has passed a law by saying that it also dislikes California's high tax policy, high state expenditure, high deficits and the tolerance of illegal immigrants, but does not tolerate the travel embargo in California.
He's laying them down as a defense for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to each state of the Union, which would order a similar ban on travel to another state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is constitutional.
States have the right to enact conscientious objection laws, and to decide what their money goes to and what they are not allowed to do.
Second, what is wrong with conscientious objection?
When a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why make him sell pork under penalty when butchers offering pork are enough?
In Colorado, one baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine because he refused to bake a cake for a homosexual wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or alcohol.
Why don't you punish him and leave him alone and order the right cakes for hundreds of bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the Federation are guaranteed, but individual states can regulate domestic policy in powers that are not federal, according to their own preferences.
Then there's diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourthly, the LGBT community once legitimately sought to tolerate their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community are guided by the rule of living and living, which should be followed by all reasonable people, but some activists are not trying to tolerate themselves and others, but by extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one should ever show moral, religious or philosophical disapproval of LGBT’s lifestyle, and if they do so, he should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I don't know the situation in American history where states have done such praises for political issues, except for the case of one.
Even in times of struggle for the civil rights of blacks, where the North and the West were on the part of integration and the South on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case was the 1950s, and the political cause was slavery and the war of the North against the South.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the blue democratic and the Red republican states is deepening and the US is mentally disintegrating.
Unauthorized agitation.
Critic Putina got a greasy fine.
Russian opposition policy Alexei Navalny received a fine of 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules before the presidential elections that will take place next year.
The court fined him for inviting people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Pushing in the last two months, he organised two major anti-government street protests and announced that he wanted to apply for the post of head of state in March of next year.
The official head of the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin, has not yet announced his candidacy, but is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and brought him to court.
He was fined for inviting people to demonstrate through videos posted on the YouTube Internet portal.
There's a fine of three hundred thousand.
"We'll take them off the judge's salary later," the critic of the Kremlin joked on Twitter.
The Russian Election Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not take part in the presidential election because he had previously been convicted of fraud.
However, a violent man who is considered a fighter against corruption is considered politically motivated by the relevant judgment.
Penalties amounting to 300,000 rubles, including 25,000 rubles, the court also imposed on Thursday two members of the Naval Election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolaji Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became the dominant figure on the scattered opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend Navalne in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to a five - year sentence for stealing the Kirovles forestry company.
In May, the verdict was confirmed by an appeal court.
The verdict is so binding that it prevents Nabal from running under Russian law.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the foundation of the empire by their Italian family, areNameling for one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth over $500 million.
The former director of Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Loutis resides in the Toorak estate, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who brought the dispute over common property and business property to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business in 2014, but the sharp dispute is constantly denied before the highest court.
Together with her mother Anna owns 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, the first store bought a family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
This is where the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999 the family sold the entire company in conversion for $85 million.
For money they bought other properties and portfolio of the De Lutis family now includes offices, construction properties in Brunswick and Sorrent, flats on Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one third of the company’s assets, while his father Colin, who, according to Paul’s words, is “a significant driving force and dominant personality ” of the De Lutis family, owns less than two thirds of the assets.
The court records state that Colin owns $316 million worth of property while Paul manages property for $176 million.
For Paul, the distribution of assets and funds has become a problem.
"Colin's proposal has been made in my eyes strongly in his favour," Paul wrote in a joint court statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first meeting of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers now also argue about who will control the existing business - from which Paul said Colin had cut off.
Colin resists the fact that this is not true and accuses Paul of mismanagement of certain properties.
In his previous post-pronged statement, Colin said he believed in a well-known solution to the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates that my family is the most important of all," he wrote.
The costs of the trial are rising. Hundreds of pages of more extensive statements, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, are flooding lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and defence attorneys from both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and lagoons since the 1950s and bought a round in Brunswick in the 1970s.
They bought property for the money they had obtained from stopping the property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco “in the last year of high school, Paul was still a young, about ten - year - old boy. ”
Anna De Lutis said that along with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to sons would go well.
"Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
Another two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group. Colin said that Mark was compensated at his departure with $10 million and Luke with $26 million.
As Paul, Luke, and Mark put it, “they were not satisfied with the conditions of their financial compensation. ”
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former member of the AFL Club Board, as reported in his 2015 autobiography by Eddie McGuire, the famous TV personality and Colin's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paula de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
He answered only Colin by means of a text report stating that, given the fact that the dispute is settled before a court, “I have nothing to add. ”
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to settle the whole matter before the court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin stated in one of the statements in Colin's court that he was trying to adapt to his brother's requirements.
"Our father would be very dissatisfied if he saw our current situation," he said and added that he "continues to hope in a viable solution".
On Friday, all the hopes were inconceivable.
"Our disputes will be resolved soon in court," Colin wrote.
A bucket in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower kids.
The drivers of the MHD are fascinating water and summer clothes.
There are now about 35 children who go out only in the morning at the elementary school in Khodovci, Prague 4, where there are now about 35 children.
The school is after reconstruction and planted trees do not provide much shade.
It's not a swimming pool, but teachers shower in the misty.
In the afternoon, the children stay in the classes where the blinds are withdrawn and the curtains are covered.
The air is trying to cool the air cleaner because the air conditioning is not available.
It's difficult for teachers and cooks as well.
"The temperature, which is in the interior and exterior, exceeds the hygiene limits for maternity schools, so that we should not even have an open operation during this period," said School Director Miloslav Makovičková.
There's a glass corridor in kindergarten where it says the temperature is about 40 degrees.
We've got six o'clock in the morning, the windows are closed, and we've got the blinds we're protecting on the south side.
"But it won't help much," she added.
Better conditions have in forest kindergarten in Hrási in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have growing trees on the property, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful peanut, underneath it is a table, and there we do different things," said the principal of the school, Barbora Companová.
Teachers and children try to walk into forest where there's more cool.
Children with wet hats and program have different games with water.
"We have a hand pressure dispenser that is used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower children," said Companová.
Also, the director of the mother school in Novoborská Street on the Prague Prosek, Jitka Vilimovská, said that the teachers are trying to keep the children in the shade and drop them with water.
"We have a fairly elevated garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 15 o'clock.
Every child must have a headgear.
Teachers also remind their children that they should drink.
For example, they may choose a little sweetened tea or a thinned juice and have water in their garden.
Each day they also have a vegetable salad to eat and a snack always fresh fruit and vegetables, which parents sometimes bring to them.
"Sometimes today, a mother brought about a ten-gallon melon for the children," Makovicková added.
Drivers get water or summer break.
The Prague DPP provides them with water, ionic beverages or summer drinks on hot days.
Driver cabs trams and buses are in most cases air-conditioned, spokeswoman Aneta Rehková said.
They are air conditioned in addition to the cabins of some tramways and in the passenger area.
The high-temperature tram tracks haven't seriously damaged anything yet.
Small damage occurred in the loop in Hostivara.
At current high temperatures, we are particularly concerned that drivers have enough drinks available.
"Cold drinking water is available in all loops, swap points and carriages," Rehková said.
In the carriageways and in some of the alterations places, employees have so-called Sodobras, which produce chilled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble ion protection drinks.
"They can also use a summer uniform that enhances the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts," the spokesman added.
The hot and dry weather of recent days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters in all of the Czech Republic destroyed 108, i.e. twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, during the day when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters mainly employed fighting fire.
"They consider fires in the natural environment and also those associated with harvest work," said fireman Nicole Zaoralová.
The relief of firefighters did not even bring an evening change in the weather when the heat in many places changed storms and storms.
In connection with the storms, firefighters were on their way to 236 attacks.
In particular, it was the removal of the harvested trees and branches.
"Most of all they intervened in the Central Bohemian region," continues Zaoralová.
Firefighters were also needed in Stvolínky, Czechoslovakia, where they evacuated 60 children from the children's camp for storm.
Tropical temperatures also assigned work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and at night on Wednesday, ambulances traveled to ten cases of carbon dioxide poisoning from punishment.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, warned the paramedics.
Carbon dioxide is a colourless gas with no smell that is released in imperfect combustion.
Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, headache and fainting.
In case of suspected poisoning, leave the contaminated room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the President's media diet
Many tried before him, and they always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If he does, he'll be the first.
Politico said that the new chief of staff at the White House is planning to limit President Trump's information flow - including television news reports - in hopes of keeping Trump on a level.
Here's part of the reporter's report, Josh Dawsey:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met on the first day of his new job with the employees, he outlined Trump’s key problem with the White House, which he intends to correct: the wrong information that is being received to the president.
Kelly announced to the employees that she must personally approve all the information - whether on paper or a spoken word - because the president can make a better decision on the basis of correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors have broken teeth at Trump's control and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back several decades - and now, when he sits in the White House, his habit of watching TV reports is even stronger.
"If Trump as a candidate was disturbed by honest reports, it was appropriate to show him that he was spoken of in a positive light by a lot of other media, which was easier to convince," said former campaign advisor in February for Politico Sam Nunberg.
Tara Palmeriová from the Politico portal wrote that “the key to keeping Trump tweets in check — at least according to the words of the six former organizers of his campaign — is to ensure that Trump regularly monitors the media that sing praises to him. ”
Okay.
However, the idea that Trump’s tendency to post his views on Twitter has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something that others don't know about - Trump's tweets would be more disturbing if someone didn't control them.
The tweets that Trump never sent, we'll probably never know.
If his employees managed to keep him in check at least a few times, then their efforts did not come to an end.
However, no one has yet been able to regularly prevent Trump from stirring up controversial issues.
Part of this problem is that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by substantiating the Trumps - which they can, but do not have to be reliable - who support their view of the world.
The Politico Portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the tendency of advisers to present questionable information to the head of the state.
This is an example of the following information from reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Contemporary and former Trump officials claim that the President often responds highly to negative media reports, especially information leak reports, and seeks to find their origin.
This situation occurred at the end of February when a copy of the article from GotNews.com - the website of provocative Charles C. Johnson - was framed by the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being “a source of many leaks of information” from the White House.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson was always on Twitter for harassment; or that he did not substantiate his claims with any evidence; or that he had already published false accusations in the past and later dismissed them.
Trump read the article and started asking Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff, Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter, “tried to implement the system of administration and documentation of information that President Trump would receive”.
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to pursue the same strategy.
Maybe he's a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulse doesn't just fade away, and his helpers are still competing for power.
These unchangeable factors of Kelly's mission certainly make it harder.
Tourists are talking about a ditch and going back to “Millionaire Quarter”
Several of the most powerful owners of houses in the English county of West Midland are once again released to cross with determined tourists who compete with local authorities for the right to regain their seats.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field near the flourishing street in Solihull, which is called the “millionaire quarter”.
While bringing horses, children and the caravan army, tourists return after being shown in May. They were not afraid of the trench that was dug up on the spot on the basis of a decree of the authorities to prevent their invasion.
The group found the gaps in the defense and penetrated the field with the caravans unprotected by a space that served as a roadway.
The Rising People of the Quarter attacked Solihull's board of directors by saying that she was unable to solve the problem.
One of the residents who wished to remain anonymous said: ‘ They planted the place on Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The Board should be ashamed of its inability to resolve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they're back.
Another one arrived last night, and more is coming today.'
She added that : ‘Birmingham Board knows how to impose this problem. To protect parks he uses court orders.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I don't want to continue to pay taxes until the board of directors deals with tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said: ‘ It’s ridiculous, we just watched the last of the departing tourists, and now they’re back.
And this time there are even more, and this time they brought horses with them.'
Solihull, a spokesman for the city’s administration, said: “We are aware of an unauthorized stay on land near Streetsbrook Road, and in cooperation with the local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to remedy the problem.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is necessary for the locals to report any non-community or illegal conduct of the policy at number 101.
So we will get the overall picture that we will present in court.'
The MEP's wife crashed a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by the government special.
The government special delivered wounded Róbert Zitňanski to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport, and on board the aircraft was under constant control by Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight went by without complications.
According to information, Róbert Zitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of summer.
He said he got hit by a car, and he's been in serious shape ever since.
After his transfer to his country, he was transported to a specialised workplace in one of Bratislava’s hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of the Slovenian MEP Jany Žitňanski from Nova.
She didn't want to speak to the incident.
She's got three kids together.
Italians fasten up in battle against NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships arriving on the coast of Italy with migrants from the Mediterranean if the NGO does not sign new rules governing their operations.
"If the NGO does not sign the new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue in their operations," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minni's warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized the ship of the German rescue organisation Jugend Rettet for suspected human trafficking, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organisation, which operates in the first year, refused to comment on the whole matter on the charges of the Italian state prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosios.
"There is and will always be a priority for us to save human lives, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the rescue zones at the moment," said the organisation in a statement on social networks.
"All current accusations can be commented only after the collection of all information and the assessment of the situation."
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Jugend Rettet Iuvent's ship since October.
Her crew is suspected of being transported aboard immigrants who were handed over to them directly by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting was held according to the plaintiff's file only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya. The meeting was published by the Italian media.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and going around the Italian coast guard, which oversees rescue operations in this area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organisations involved in rescue operations have yet agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last designated organisation on Thursday stated that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable, since they do not constitute any ‘substantial change or obstacle’ as regards rescue operations.
For example, the adoption of the new code of conduct was rejected by the Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which is owned by the Nobel Prize.
Minnit, meanwhile, has heard that a sharp decline in immigrants in recent weeks landing in Italy under rescue operations indicates that the effort to strengthen patrols along the coast of Libya and to cooperate with local mayors is bearing fruit.
"In the last days we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He also unveiled plans for further negotiations that will take place this month with the mayors of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that these countries leave in the hope of achieving Europe.
Unscrupulous Mesarošová: She had a silicone and a cellulite coming out of the pool!
The hot summer days are all about taking what's necessary to cover up the most intimate party.
Only Dominika Mesaroš does it the other way around.
At an afternoon meeting at a Prague zoo, where actors, moderators, singers and all that they have to do with TV prima, just a hiccup, she put her body in a mini-opal.
And only a few regular moves were enough, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her butt.
He checked out how many times he cut himself between the halves, and he coughed up so high that he still had to fix it.
The attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present was certainly not needed.
Michelle Carter is convicted of sending text messages suggesting the suicide of Conrad Roy
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to imprisonment for two years for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide by means of text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, aged 20, will stay 15 months from a two-year sentence behind bars and then spend five years on parole.
Carter was sentenced in June for the unintentional killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Roy’s father said on Thursday in court: “The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left at large until the decision was made.
She was threatened with 20 years of imprisonment, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy had suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and creamy blouse, Carter stood in the process of declaring judgment on the spot with tears in his eyes, in his hands and eyes pointing toward the ground.
“Her conduct killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor said.
"She ended his life to make her own life easier.
She could not accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
However, Carter’s legal representative said that they were “unfortunate circumstances which he deeply regretted. ”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “their age or level of maturity or even mental disorder do not have a significant impact on her conduct.”
The prosecutor read Roy’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement: “One day she will not run away so that I don’t grieve over the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I care for his sisters and together we will endure the great pain we will bear with us forever," the statement said.
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy has testified that she is “persecuted” by the fact that she will never attend her brother's wedding and will never be the aunt of his children.
"The loss of a man I have seen since my birth is the pain I will carry for life," she said.
The State of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that affects a person helping another person to kill himself, and this case therefore sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 in a car seat, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case drew the attention of the entire nation after the text reports of Carter were published, which incited suicide.
“It doesn’t matter to me whether you jump out of a building or stab yourself,” said a text message that Carter sent just two weeks before his death when Roy was on family leave.
A few minutes before she killed herself, she wrote to him, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "All you have to do is plant a generator and be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised a lot of questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, she was acquitted.
Ms. Knox (30) said in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail. ”
Audi will adjust up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just the day before the announcement of the Audi car manufacturer BMW stated that it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of the BMW said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in reaction to European cities - including Munich, which is the seat of the BMW - which considers bans or restrictions on diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he will adjust three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have promoted large amounts of use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to comply with the carbon dioxide regulations.
However, nitrogen oxide released by diesel engines is considered carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of cars to install gas neutralisation devices issued by diesel engines, which makes it less competitive for cars.
While German car manufacturers face careful searches, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces charges of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The company is trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, which, in order to meet the emission limits, installed software in its vehicles, which in testing reduced the amount of emissions released, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior representatives of Volkswagen have been indicted in the United States and the others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
The former Head of Thermodynamics for Engine Development in Audi would be arrested in Germany last month.
Former manager of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian national, and therefore does not apply to him in extradition, so he can face trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in the criminal investigation of the German police into Volkswagen's car after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to cover European emission limits - and expanded the charges that Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of Audi car in the investigation may have a slight impact on Volkswagen: luxury car manufacturers form a disproportionate proportion of Volkswagen profits.
The plane landed on the beach in an emergency.
A man and a little girl died.
There was an accident on the beach Praia de São João in the area of Costa da Caparica, about 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the Witnesses at the SIC Noticias TV channel said that the plane flew just before landing over the people who sunk on the beach.
Some people on the beach reportedly fled from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape before the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died on the beach according to local media.
"The plane hit them and they were dead on the spot," said local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board, both of them were taken alive from the accident, and the police took them to the interview.
D11 or not to set up a freeway.
And the highways in the Czech Republic are even complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's unbuilt, even though it started to build in 1978.
Even if it's unbuilt, it's constantly being repaired.
And it still can't be built, even if it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, Castle Highway D11.
The construction of another section of it at least for a few months has brought the Earth's Children's Movement to a halt.
We eastwalkers get the highway by bits, like when they cut salami.
They're gonna cut the wheel, and then we're gonna see when and if we're ever gonna get another one.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten our driving time and we want to get the stones going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
The endless currents of the trucks go right through the city of Jaroměr or Náchod, which is not as reasonable as a hug.
But to date the last section of our dream highway was implemented in 2008, i.e. nine years ago, an incredible nine years ago.
Not even a knock since.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometres of unfinished section of Hradec Králova began to be built recently, and in other sections of Jaroměřia, an archaeological survey began with the beginning of construction at the end of this year, you could hear loud throbbing in eastern Bohemia.
Nobody ever believed that again.
Last week, it turns out he's not gonna get up this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Movement of the Children of the Earth-Club for Sustainable Transport from Brno has broken down.
Earth's children repeat their D1 tactics.
They attacked the decision on the construction permit to the fullest extent.
In the breakdown, they request a review of all the binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the Gradeck Magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Authority.
So far we're leaving D11 near the village with the eloquent name Funeral.
So we're going down, we're just going down the freeway, and suddenly we're standing on the side road, and we're preferring to join the column.
The worst part is you see similar stories all over the Republic.
It's a scary, constantly crowded road to Benešov, D1 or D8.
Everyone's got their Funeral.
What do Earth's Children demand?
What is the essence of the problems of building communications in the Czech Republic?
And why is the highway network virtually incomplete in the existing system?

Levandule of Provence threatens climate change
Levandules have become a symbol of Provence in the area of south-eastern France, but are now threatened by climate change.
Levandulí escapes as a result of the dry climate and harmful insects, causing fear on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provenza, stated: “The growing of levandules in Provenza is at risk because in the last few years the plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings less precipitation in spring and autumn.
That affects the life of the lioness.
They also blame the cicadas and locusts carrying micro-bacteria that thrive in the dry climate."
There's a lot at stake.
Levandule attracts tourists and the oil produced from them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The quantity of oil obtained from these levandules is, of course, smaller."
The possible solution may be more efficient water distribution and water evaporation, but also levandul injections can protect the mixture of food and water and breed more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of journalists highlights rising threats in Mexico
Employees of the Riodoc weekly meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss the news of the unrest in Sinaloa in the presence of organised criminals, corrupt officials and non-stop drug wars.
Today, however, recent events are under pressure primarily for their own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two deserving journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to the office that someone attacked with a grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutrals and allies.
Journalists will be asked to name each word - there is no need for any evidence, just use imagination and premonition.
Picking them out of what - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from governments or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose task is to cover up criminal acts.
Violence does not stop and the bodies are carried out across the country; journalists among them are constantly arriving: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 of them are in power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven have been killed in all seven states this year.
Among them also co-founder of Riodioca periodical, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence related to drug trafficking.
His loss is clear, although his presence is all-progressive - large photos of Valdez with the inscription “Justice”, on which the middle man points, hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a shirt with a picture of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and hat Panama.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia, and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, two suspects have been indicted.
Most of the thousands of murders that happen every year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime.
Journalists from Riodoc insist that they will be informed of the violence that is taking place in Sinaloa; even though the destruction of the land is now very treacherous.
Without information about the murderers and without a view of justice, the safety meeting is pointless, says Ibarra.
"It is foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, no one can be trusted."
On the morning of May 15 he left Valdez at Riodocé, Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to drive several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, apparently due to the title of the article - which can be translated as the 12th river.
The shooters then boarded his car and beat him up near the crime scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left his wife and two grown children behind.
There seems to be a rapid spread of rumors in Culiacan.
However, in the Valdez case, there is still still suspicion.
Since last year's arrest, Guzman and his January release to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's most bloodthirsty battlefields, as the rival faction seeks to fill an empty space.
Every day several people are killed in Sinaloi streets, and the cemetery is full of two-storey mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word “arms ” means that a drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes to travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodace are still recovering from not protecting his friend.
He believes that two doubts contributed to his death.
The first was a February interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war with the sons of Joaquín Guzman.
Smyr may have angered the sons; the suspected gang members copied all the copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the capture of other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death was seen as an important milestone in fighting Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In the Noroeste period, he was practically veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his shares worth $50 and start with five colleagues of Riodoc.
In Sinaloe "it was impossible to operate a journalist without mentioning the drug trade," said Bojorquez.
Riodoc has gained a good reputation for brave and true reporting in time; the newspapers have begun to prosper.
Journalists liked to search for problematic topics and publish uncensored texts - readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after the founding, Riodoc won the prestigious award Maria Moores Cabot for the report on Latin America.
This same year Valdez won the International Freedom Press Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his brave report on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted he was afraid.
"I was worried about my life," he said when he accepted the price.
The drug trade in Sinaloae is “a way of life”, Valdez said in October last year in an interview for Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take on the role of a journalist - or play dumb.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What did you face death... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The employees of Riodoc miss Valdez. The man was known for his jokes and unchosen language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar across from the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask, "Did this routine cause his death?"
His death in them also raised questions about his own assumptions - how do you do your best and stay alive?
"They don't like it when you get involved with their wives, their children, clean shops, secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," said Bojorquez.
As a result, self-censorship and self-preservation are high.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel something's not playing, hands off.
The problem is, said editor Riodoc Andres Villarreal, “whose sense can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier happened. ”
The old rules according to him, as according to others, no longer apply in Sinaloae - as in the countries of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to the toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
There are no mobile phones allowed in the Riodocs' meeting room; a few days ago, a spyware was discovered that was purchased by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two policemen find relief in front of a 40 - degree bucket in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect Riodocé's offices, located in a four-story building in the Culiacano neighbourhood.
Journalists are exasperating whether these police officers are 50 percent of the law’s guardians who are said to be corrupt.
It has been a few months since the last press went into the mining areas that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the program this week.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloe.
They are also dedicated to the suspected government spending that took place in the hometown of the governor of the state.
Recently there have also been several abductions in one of the most luxurious restaurants in Culiacán, just a block away from the state attorney's office.
Officially, no one announced the identity of the abducted people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were alerted when they were about to write about what every city dweller knows: that the restaurant is a popular destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from the public records that the restaurant was registered under a name that is linked to a certain policy that is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which controls all levels of the political scene of almost the last century.
A number of PR governors were recently accused of high-post corruption.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about earlier incidents at the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín’s sons, “El Chapo” Guzman, escaped military intervention.
A month ago, readers would have read the topic in Valdez’s section, the best source of information on kidnappings.
“Valdez would certainly crack the case,” said Villarreal (46), nicknamed “El Flaco” for his slim character.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office turned into a magazine of signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists, and the employees did not expect them to become activists in the press.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and appeared next morning to demonstrate in front of the state attorney's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame only disappeared three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only the burned body was discovered. The authorities claim that based on DNA analysis it is Adamea.
The activity of journalists is increasing throughout the country. Many of them organize protests and crochet on sidewalks and buildings “SOS print”.
The director of the newspaper Bojorquez is visiting Washington, where he seeks international support and justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, who was held the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused the authorities of watching journalists and their murders for reporting the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked for a transfer to another department for fear that her anger could jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are “encouraged” with organized crime, corrupt officials, and unconscionable public opinion.
In his latest book Narco-journalism, journalists die not only by the hand of drug cartels but also by ordering politicians and security forces who cooperate with organised crime.
The Media Supervisory Group Articulo 19 accused more than half of all attacks on police journalists and public officials.
"You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez said.
The murders are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, who happened six years ago at the northern borders of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a message allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “This is how I ended up because of my reports. ”
There were keyboards and headphones next to the severed head.
Some branch offices have decided to end their activities, such as El Norte, based at the northern borders of the state of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslav Breach.
Others continue, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after killing his principal in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the public drug cartels Article on the opening page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists fled their homes or even across borders.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding work in exile is difficult, as it is to get rid of the feeling that you are constantly being persecuted.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, such as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their jobs, each day presents a great risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, which is why I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday midnight, and Riodoc's employees are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest editions are sent to the printery - drinking beer when the phone starts ringing at the same time.
It is reported that 19 people died in a gang-police shooting near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many messages left in this area were promised.
Journalists publish this news from the mobile phone on the Riodoc web site.
Not one day will run, and the opening title will change again.
The sounds of the police sirens indicate another shooting.
Bojorquez looks at police patrols to see if they're paying attention.
If they're afraid, they don't show it in any way.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their period - whose middleman is the eloquent slogan for the entire Sinaloe - all Riodoc employees follow his steps.
"How could we possibly think about leaving," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
Researchers have now discovered the conclusions of the first find of a remarkable creature of the size of a rhino whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called ‘Mona Lisa Dinosaur’ - found the Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high extent that experts were able to determine the red color of his furted skin and stated that the dinosaur had a ‘problem past’.
An article in Current Biology magazine stated that it is “the most preserved yet found armored dinosaur and one of the best types of dinosaur in the world”.
The fossil is a new species of herd Nodosauridae. Dinosaurus lived in the period Creda, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked the researchers who described him with the words “really remarkable”.
According to National Geographic, the irradiated white animal is the best preserved fossil of its species.
Behind the find stands Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 when drilling in the bottom of Suncor Millenium near the Canadian Alberta.
He ran into something that looked like a strange object and decided to explore it closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers have spent the next six years working to discover an animal from a vast piece of land weighing 1,100 kg.
After the work is finished, the dinosaur is ready to discover.
“Just a little bit of eyelash and you'll believe he's asleep,” said Caleb Brown, director of the work, and the natural scientist of the Royal Tyrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
“Surely it will be written in history as one of the most beautiful and preserved species of dinosaurs – Mona Lisa dinosaurs.”
By studying his skin researchers found that this herbivorous - although he was covered with armor and recalled walking tank - he was likely faced with a serious threat by carnivorous dinosaurs.
A heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect predators and used a cloaking system that uses many of today’s animals.
Experts argue that this enabled him to blend better with his surroundings and avoid the enemies. The cloaking system suggests that he was a popular food of larger dinosaurs.
News of 110 million years old dinosaur family Nodosauridae first appeared in the newspaper in May. Currently it is available for viewing in Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers gave him the name Borealopelta marmitchelli after the technology of the Mark Mitchell museum, which he and the team spent more than 7,000 hours carefully discovering fossils.
Thanks to the amazing fossil condition, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists could document patterns and shape of sheds and armor all over the body.
They discovered the masking method commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this cloaking effect is common in nature, the findings of researchers are surprising, because Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that the dinosaur was such a number of predators that evolution gave the advantage of masking against confrontation in survival.
Many of the present animals with masking - for example deer, zebra, or belt - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the rhinodaurus had to fight for his surviving literally.
“The transmission of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by the predators during the chalk season,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic ingredients contained in the sheds also revealed that the dinosaur skin was likely to have reddish-brown discoloration.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for other knowledge of its life, including the preserved contents of its stomach, to trace its last food.
They believe that after his death the dinosaur fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he sank to the bottom.
In the area of Alberta at that time, the climate was the same as in Florida today, and the rivers and oceans dragged far further into the interior than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved shrapnel skin and at the same time preserved in three dimensions and we can see its original size,” Brown said.
“For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as at the time of the chalk.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; just a little bit to make your eyes feel like they're just sleeping.'
During the chalky season, giant terropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, were walking on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - the Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could be the favorite prey of his equally horrifying ancestors.
Among them is Acrocanthosaurus, 11.5 metres long monster with a weight of over 6 tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in Current Biology, believe that the body of Borealopelta was washed into the sea after being mummified in the mud.
Behind the find stands Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 when drilling at the bottom of Suncor Millenium near the Canadian Alberta.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is also complete from the chanel after the hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 metres and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
He had two 50-inch pins sticking out of his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herb was sweeping the territory of today's Canada until it ended up in a river that flooded it into the sea.
His submarine tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
Fossil residues of this type are also maintained to the extent that the armored plate around the skull still covers the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote to the National Geographic, ‘ finding such a surviving individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I follow him, the more shocking it seems to me.
Fossil residues of this type are also maintained to the extent that the armored plate around the skull still covers the skin.
On his side lies his right front foot with his fingers pointing up.
I count the drawers on his foot easily.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question, ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook her whole body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a cousin from St. Louis sat on her bed in an Airbnb room and went through posts on Facebook on her phone.
She came across a contribution from a high school student.
"The police just shot an 18-year-old young man whose body is still lying on the street," he said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
TheePharoah's user constantly retweeted her contributions to the wall.
Rapper of St. Louis tweeted his papers on the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old young man shot by a white-skinned policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's body lying in the street uncontrollably, where no one took him after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She hung up the phone to get back to him the night she watched tweets about people who were gathering at Canfield Drive.
She followed photos of police tapes and screaming people. One of the men claimed that the father of the victim and held a sign in his hand with the inscription “The Ferguson police killed my unarmed son”!
She watched live reports - one of the officers was standing in front of a group of protestors, holding a lead in his hand and at his other end of the barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, as she said, held a gun aimed at the crowd and shouted: “I will kill you all... animals. ”
"That's not normal," Ferrell said.
"This is not the kind of murder we're used to and we can call normal.
I felt goose skin all over my body.
"I was angry and crying."
She immediately booked a return flight and went home the second day.
After landing at 11:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years describes the new “Whose Streets” document, which will be released on August 11th.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and continuity told from the perspective of people living in the community who go to the streets and demand answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in flower jerseys and the same flower forehead - on the subject that they had discussed many times before - "about experiences with blacks".
"Do you remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" He recalls the conversation.
"Now we're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old and that's not right."
"It was out of the question that I would not take it with me," Ferrell later said.
“Today’s events are the culmination... that has occurred in the past.
She must have known and seen it with her own eyes and grown up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time had to know the difference between different layers of experience with blacks and what we had to do to free ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she does not experience racism on her own skin, she is no different in any way from another black child-woman.
I feel that if I could protect her from this experience, I would only hurt her."
After arriving in Ferguson, South Florissant Road was the first road stop across the street from the police department, which became the base of activists who were expecting the words of Officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
This is where Ferrell and his daughter met a local businessman who was preparing for the rest of the food.
Together, they prepared food for the bags and helped deliver it to the Protestants.
In the eyes of Ferrell, a new type of activism began slowly to emerge.
“My activism turned upside down after August 9th,” Ferrell said, adding that she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn in her studies at the University of Missouri-St. Louis University.
"I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with a later co-director, Sabaah Folayan during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document only" the ongoing events.
But Ferrell thought, "Do you work on a document or are you trying to find a story that could be used?"
This type of skepticism has infiltrated the community through many people, often white men, who wanted to make money on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We have heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected and that we wanted to change. ”
Folayan has already cooperated with co-director Damon Davis, who is a respected local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners for the purpose of death.
His involvement in the project also interested Ferrell, along with the other six local residents who were followed by the “Whose Streets” team in the years following Brown’s murder.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it is our statement," Davis said.
"It was important to me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way."
While the purpose of the document was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell - in an attempt to show that the movement “is not about the savior leader but about the rapprochement of the community”, Folayan said - it has proved to be the most open against participation in filming.
The document “Whose Streets?” thus describes the very personal aspect of Ferrell’s life, the example of how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face when thinking about the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
"But I understood that in order to do this job and police black people, I have to open up."
The story of Ferrell also highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the wider aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to the killing of Teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on the social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves weirdos.
"Black eccentric women in leading positions ultimately stand behind the maintenance of the movement," Ferrell said, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must bear the burden of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that “the movement is in fact supported by black women and a great deal of eccentric black women. ”
However, he insists that “this is not just an affirmation matter” and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of her opinions.
"It was she who was the driving force and the power source," she said.
“that she just found herself in front lines is not a coincidence, because life on these intersections in the skin of a black weirdo woman is dangerous.
You can feel that power surge in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, they cleared the cameras of the television stations of their position, but the difficult racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year probation for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
The social political atmosphere in the area she calls home described as “the disorder. ”
Still, she has not stopped in her efforts since she left for Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains."
The field was on fire in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters went to the scene, and a helicopter also helped.
Near the Český Brod in Kolínsk, between the villages of Yeljany and Liblice, it was burning from 14:00 a.m. a.m. a.m. by a distance of about 15 hectares.
Fire ceased to spread around 15:15, firefighters declared a third degree of fire alarm out of four possible.
According to the fireman Ladislav Holomečík, fire was also used by fire from the air to fire a helicopter.
At 6 p.m., firemen were able to put out the fire, fire caused damage for 700,000 crowns.
Dozens of professional and voluntary firefighters fought with the flames on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical malfunction in the motor space of the combine.
Hasit also helped a helicopter, which carried out a total of six water slides.
"We handed over the owner instead of the attack until 8:00 tomorrow he will be guarded by a unit of voluntary firefighters," said Holomečík.
And Becoming Rememblence: An artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Friedman Gallery is located immediately several faces of different shades of skin - white, black and brown - hanging from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them seems to fall out of the eye of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were made by Heather Dewey-Hagborg, an artist who was sent by Chelsea Manning, from the swabs of the mouth cavity and hair.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the unauthorized publication of secret cablegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on August 2nd, bears the name A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines his experience with technology, information and art, and Manning, a transsexual and pioneering dissident whose punishment was reduced by Obama three days before his departure from the presidency of the United States.
The algorithmic analysis of the DNA of Manning and the use of 30 portraits to illustrate what a person would look like with this genotype, was created by Dewey-Hagborg's razor, if not an intellectual commentary on the subjectivity of DNA - as well as many ways that DNA can be interpreted - and the irrefutable determination of these interpretations, as well as identities.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has been talking since her youth about being considered a woman. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of 20 indictments, including violations of six spy laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photos were detained by the prison staff. Only one black and white photo in lower quality, which Manning, visibly concerned, sat in the driver's seat in the platinum blonde wig, which is now connected to.
In 2015, positive reactions to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborg project were still received.
Within the framework of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette and gum burners - to create a picture of possible forms of these people.
And this is when I received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
“There was an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and they wanted to complete the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of the opening of the new exhibition.
However, neither visitors nor photography were allowed, so Chelsea was asked if she would be interested in the DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse have been friends for two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Supressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would have happened if Chelsea had been pardoned and could take part in the exhibition in person.
Indeed, President Obama asked for the release of Manning a few days after the comic book was released, which was a welcome change after several unbearable years spent in a military prison in Kansas.
Indeed, it is interesting that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is at war with people who seek to publicize government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to stimulate their tweets in areas that he should support.
In response to a question about this special timing Dewey-Hagborg stated that “everything is happening for some reason”.
Under the declaration of an artist on one of the walls of the gallery he calls Manninga by his huge signature (the letter “i” in the surname is trodden with the heart) after the end of “self-increasing fractionation, which is based on sex, race, sexuality and culture”.
On the opposite side there are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - centipede letters C, G and A recorded in pencil.
By listing 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to a sophisticated scientific dictionary artist) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least on the biological page, we all are.
"I hope that people will take away from this that our genome does not matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and each can interpret them in its own way," Dewey-Hagborg said.
"DNA tells a lot of different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last copy of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page of the above graphic novel.
He shows Manning how to climb King Kong out of the United States disciplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
"As soon as they prevent you from speaking, they will win," it says.
"Never let yourself be silenced."
“It’s a direct transcript from one of the letters,” said a philadelf artist.
"When I think about it, I get goose bumps."
Manning has not personally visited the exhibition - which was foretold in the comic book - but when it does, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by her masks, its own genome similarities, sorted as a crowd of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including nearly 160 cm high statues of Manning, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded in pencil.
"In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted them to sage a sense of crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said about portraits.
“I wanted to direct the impression of mass movement, which takes the form of Chelsea and frees it.”
Professor Northwestern University and staff member of Oxford University wanted for murder
These days, a nationwide search is under way for Professor Northwestern University and staff of Oxford University, who are being prosecuted for suspected murder of a man who was stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, the police reported.
On Monday, an arrest warrant was issued for the murder of a first-degree man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau's death, states Cook County's file.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died as a result of several stab wounds.
Chicago Police said the body of the deceased was found on July 27th.
Police officers were alerted to this fact by telephone. Upon arrival to Grand Plaza Apartments found the victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the scene, and the detectives are investigating the case as a homicide, while the police are looking for both suspects, the authorities have reported.
Lathem has been a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice-president of the University for Public Relations, stated in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from the university's school premises.
"The whole matter is now being investigated by the competent authorities and the Northwestern University is fully cooperating with them," said Cubbage.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
University speakers and Somerville College said in a statement sent by e-mail: “The British police have contacted us and we are ready to assist the American police as well.”
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were actually shocked and wished to apply to the police.
Anthony Googlelmi, head of public relations with the Chicago Police Department, said he called on suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have information about their whereabouts and the search for suspects is escalating," Googleelmi said.
Googlelmi added that the local, regional and national authorities are helping the police in the search for suspects.
According to Guggilmi, the police received a call from the building manager Grand Plaza, who was alerted to events to occur at apartment no. 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Googlelmi said it was unclear if the incident occurred on July 27th.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Googlelmi said.
The Grand Plaza management issued a statement to all residents: “Police are now working to compile a time overview and profile of the victim and investigates various motives, including domestic violence.”
"In the near future we will complete the WADA plan" - Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko stated that it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and to reestablish the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
‘A part of the new plan criteria has now been completed and RUSADA has already obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan aimed at complying with the code - which describes the criteria for renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutka, the code does not contain anything that should bother Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned is calling for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation investigated by Richard McLaren, allegedly sponsoring the government's doping of Russian athletes.
On this subject, Mutko said: “We are investigating because our anti - doping system obviously failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programmes in our country, and we cannot admit to anything that never existed."
Mutkova's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russian RSport Smirnov, he admitted to the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but added: “On many occasions we have stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely without reservation," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADA of issuing doping checks in Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation authorised the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit to Moscow's headquarters in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is “on the right path” to resume its operation.
The police have accused three people, one is juvenile.
The police accused three men of setting up a rare wooden church fire in Třinci-Gutech on Frýdecko-Místeck.
One accused is juvenile, all three are Czech nationals.
They are facing up to 15 years in prison for the criminal offence of general threat.
This is what Moravskosoles police director Tomáš Kužel told reporters today.
According to him, it was an intentional crime.
"It is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," Kuzel said.
He said the police would be dealing with possible arrests.
Further information according to the Director cannot be made public.
"I can't say any more at the moment, because it's really what criminal police and investigation officials are working on, and the prosecutor who's overseeing the matter," Kuzel said.
The wooden church of God’s body in Guti came from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The material damage will go according to preliminary estimates to tens of millions of crowns, but historical loss is innumerable.
After the fire, the restoration of the church began to be considered.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, additional costs are ready to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the City, a public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. local parishes.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová also destroyed 15 years ago.
That's when the electrical malfunction caused it.
It then made accurate copies.
The state counts on citizens defending the state.
It will support their training.
With financial support for societies used in the defence of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, the substantive purpose of the Civil Protection Act is to count.
The Ministry of Defence, which has received the task of processing it from the government, promises to increase the physical fitness of the Czechs and their abilities, which could then be used in crisis situations.
It comes out of a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were adopted in the future, the state would have invested hundreds of millions of crowns in promoting defence.
The basic aim of the proposal is, according to his authors, to create an effective system that would help to increase the willingness of the people of the Czech Republic to defend the state, beyond the performance of the defence obligation and on the basis of voluntaryness.
For example, the state would financially or materially support the associations of amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would enable them to enhance their members’ abilities.
In return, he would obtain data on people who are willing to come to the country at a time of crisis for help and on their abilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist communities and other stakeholders in training or training.
It also counts on organizing words with war veterans or men who acted heroically.
One possible option assumes that a new office would be created to be responsible for the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that the participation of people should be voluntary and that the state should take advantage of their abilities only after the threat has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual erasing of previously obvious boundaries between different types of threats," the so-called hybrid threats are stated in the intention to point out.
Ministry officials have noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible range of capabilities, not just military.
"The primary objective of the plan is to create a very wide base that will enable every citizen to respond in a qualified manner to situations that threaten the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect himself, to contribute, where appropriate, to the protection of others, and to do no harm to the performance of tasks to the armed forces of the Czech Republic," the intention states.
The adoption of the law would bring little financial claim.
According to the Ministry, the above will depend on the choice.
For example, the Authority foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens to defend the state up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordination centre were established, its operation could cost around 60 million crowns per year.
More money would go to salaries or to building an information system.
The proposal also assumes that there would be a need to extend the scope of the regional military headquarters, which would employ 42 other soldiers together.
The representatives of the ministry had already stated that the law should also help resolve some Czech politicians' disagreements with the introduction of the European Union Directive on the possession of weapons.
Its acceptance would allow shooters who will be part of the system to retain some of the weapons that the directive provides.
Startups that will help your company not to become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of her e-commerce startup employees, but did not find an appropriate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And while promising an anonymous survey, some employees expressed their distrust of the whole process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of the hair care company Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, who employs 75 people.
So she asked for help from the outside.
New startups from the human resources sector are constantly emerging on the market, helping companies with job satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with a specific purpose of measuring employees' obligations, startups allow companies to make quick votes, target specific teams and demographic groups, also offers complete anonymity of employees and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases also allow informers to bypass supervisors and contact the Director directly.
"There are tools on the market such as Strava and Fitbit that monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Glint startup based in Reedwood City.
Errett said that thanks to Glint, she gained more awareness of what her employees think and how she feels in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a temperature map of the company and a common overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of managers with low rating - which allows the user to work on the repair.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to look at the culture of the working environment - in case they become another Uber - which is rejected in scandals after a former employee published a post on his blog describing the company environment and the harassment of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, demand for research of corporate culture is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and complicity can exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
The Denver Convercent startup in Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a slight increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before Uber scandals.
Almost 600 clients of Converter include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber also took Uber under his wings.
Similar to Glint, Convergence allows companies to send adaptable "bright" surveys, collect confidential information in real time and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text-hot line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
Where the Director-General is involved, complaints shall be sent directly to the Management Board.
"The Court of Public Opinion has authorized regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the Convergence startup.
Quinlan added that if the company is found to be mistreated by its employees or unethical behaviour - and if the regulators do not act - it can face costly consequences as a result of customer boycotting, staff exhaustion or judicial proceedings.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, uses the Convergence for over a year to raise employees' awareness of corporate principles and procedures and ensure an easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to seek out a phone number or e-mail on the company's management, officially file a complaint and hope for a viable solution.
It was often a gruesome and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, the general representative of Ruby Tuesday, according to which there was no reliable way to monitor employees' complaints.
Now that the company is using the Converter, there is a rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never previously reached managers sitting in offices, a mile away from a real solution to complaints - based on discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"It is approaching a holistic, overall view of staff experience," said Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"We also protect shareholders from legal disputes by employees."
Companies stopped taking the ethics, values and participation of employees in light weight in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron fell on the abuse of employees' ethical rights, Quinlan said.
But only when “you lit up social media for the whole thing ” did society realize that they could not simply hide their skeletons in a closet in the online world.
"Before people started using technology to monitor ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Converter offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by bold capital investors who supported both startups.
In his February campaign, Convergence picked out companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital totalling $10 million and eventually raised $47 million in capital.
Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and earned $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and risk capital.
The growing number of research clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And on competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, they are not the main advantage of high wages and interesting projects.
The employees want to see that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a society that seeks a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, they perceive that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they seek the success of society," said Nina McQueen, vice-president of global benefits and the employment benefits of LinkedIn, who uses Convergence and Glint.
Investors make money if companies and companies prosper if they are satisfied with their employees.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure the commitment and commitment of employees to society, it is no wonder that a lot of investors support this effort.
According to experts on working culture, it is important to have data on staff satisfaction.
But the data itself is useless if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is, once the company requests feedback from its employees, there can be major changes.
And if the change does not come quickly - at worst at all - it can cause disappointment and disinterest of employees.
"As soon as you ask for 4000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of consultancy at Kotter International, who was a witness to many companies that were too relying on the data itself.
“As soon as you don’t finish things, employees will start asking themselves, ‘Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I care?"
Madison Reed, who now regularly conducts research among employees each month, has been able to solve the problem within one day thanks to Glint, Errett said.
Following a feedback meeting from staff who were frustrated by slow decision making and quality of communication, Errett managed to reorganize several teams within the company and start training communication to address the problem.
Ruby Tuesday gets a very important view of her employees and hopes to achieve a high level of employment from a long-term perspective in a sector that is known for its frequent release.
"If you do not seek to create a transparent working environment, employees will not trust you," Vitrano added.
"And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company is going down."
Thursday became the warmest day.
Thursday is with 38.3 degrees recorded in The Watchtower in Hodonínsk the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic.
So he overcame a strike that was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The employees of the Czech Hydrometeorology Institute informed about this.
Against Tuesday on Thursday, but there were not many temperature records.
Vedra hit Moravia mainly, in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records of 35 out of 145 meteorological stations measured over 30 years were exceeded or aligned.
On Thursday, only nine long-term stations recorded a record.
For example, today’s temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record in The Watchtower.
In Lednica, Břeclavsk today, 37.4 degrees above the original maximum of four tenths of the degree, and in Pogoreljice, the current 37.1 degrees above the record by three tenths.
Both records, like those of The Watchtower, dates back to 2013.
High temperatures have appeared today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Watch Tower, the largest heat in Dyjákice was in Znojmsk and Broda nad Dyj in Břeclav, where mercury had climbed 37.8 degrees, but the record did not prevail.
On the other hand, in Western and Northwestern Czechs, according to the Czech Republic's website, today's highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures began to grow there until later this afternoon," meteorologists said.
Current heats in the Czech Republic will gradually resound according to the Czech Republic, and on Sunday there could be even more significant rain.
In most places of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia and Saturday.
We've got a lot of shit going on here.
Billionaires don't have the same voice in elections as every single adult in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as bold as Andrew Babish who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of the Penty Marek Dospiva together with other colleagues behind the water Martin Burdo and Antonín Fryč sponsored the Robejško Realisty.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the entrepreneur in real estate Pavel Sehnal, who is also the president of his side.
The convicted corrupter and the king of the Czech gambling Ivo Valenta took the Private Party.
The political movement of Agrofert, as the Andreje Babiš project has been named by Croat Mayor Jaroslav Nemec, is a chapter for itself.
The Ancients also recently caught their billionaires.
It's Dalibor Grandfather, the company's owner at Jablotron's security device.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
Entree in the mayor's jersey didn't do much good for Grandpa.
"I never dreamed of small goals," said the press conference.
This means that my goal is to make the YES movement get twenty percent in elections.
Leckda's smiling.
But my grandfather's denial is rather symbolic.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandfather is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to apply for voter votes in the Aged uniform, he continues to support Andreje Babiš.
Because Babish's grandfather supported the past parliamentary elections.
"Babish is not a shot by a speaker and does not rule by a popular rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 elections.
But certainly not politics because he wants to improve himself personally.
Babish will remain a hero to me.
He's willing to step out of his world, under control, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after being introduced by the Elders as a new force, he confessed from his admiration for Babish again.
And he said he wanted the Elders to learn how to work with Babish.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa does not change his mind and stands for himself no matter what uniform he just wears.
Others may speculate whether Babish is sending to the Ages to build his bereavement of someone so immobile.
Others may ask whether the boss of Jablotron, perhaps with the boss of Agrofert, has broken up in an evil store and is looking for another way to defend himself against his business rival.
Grandad's first public performance wasn't just around Babish.
Grandpa promised to send ten million crowns to the Ages.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard for anyone to stop a similar statement.
Finally, the court-recognitioned Gauner Zdeněk Bakala threw millions at all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency Víta Barta, TOP 09 and the civil democrats have come together almost thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law forbids any political party to give more than three million.
When Grandpa enters politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Perhaps he would not have to ask why politics has such a bad reputation.
His first days in politics then Grandpa crowned with a proposal for tax advantages for families with studied children.
People with college education will come to our house about fifty thousand a month.
The ones with the base for less than 20.
The man with the 50 thousand is rich in the ratios here.
The one with the 20 poor.
In Santa's vision, the poor are fair paying taxes and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the social state, on which they do not share much.
In short, the rich need help to avoid poverty.
The elders can congratulate each other on their new acquisitions and Babish can hold my hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Grandpa, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
Then there is the question of who to elect.
For me, those who know the rules of the game want to follow them.
Those who are not members of their party or nationals and nationals of the State for their employees and the country for their property.
And in the end, those who want to have a good life in a rich country are not just some people.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex must have cut by 234 million.
Sale of real estate is sometimes not easy.
And often, not even 11 bedrooms, a beautiful view of the sea, or the fact that the property is sold by the president of the United States of America, Donald Trump.
When selling Le Chateau des Palmiers' villa complex, the price went down by an incredible 8 million pounds.
Informed the Mirror.co.uk website.
The brochure says, "Hi, Donald J. Trump."
Run to the place like no other.
But even the connection between a real estate company and an American president did not defend an extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to lower the price of his Caribbean home by an incredible 8 million pounds.
The original price of the property was £11.5 million, the final price fell to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex stands as about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised about.
The impressive 5 acre building on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full-size bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, gyms and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
A pool and tennis court are also part of the property.
Tens of palm trees are planted on the property.
From the terrace there is a beautiful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the fact that the connection with the President is not sufficient to attract potential buyers has been shown at a price.
Now the property is closer to normal prices of properties on the island.
Trump bought a real estate in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about 15 million pounds.
The property was to be bought for rent.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on St. Martin Island.
But with a new price, it's second place.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at 13.5 million pounds.
NCAA decided to end two training sessions a day. For Bruins there are long days.
The eleventh morning is approaching, and players of UCLA University's American football team are tumbling at the sideline of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal their sweaty backs, the unfailing sign of the first day of training camp.
For most of the team's members these few minutes, nothing happens at a lunch break.
Players entering the summer semester will go to rooms after a three-hour training session to study for final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place at 6:30 in the morning.
"For these boys, the next three days will be a decent kitty," Coach Bruins Jim Mora said shortly before Monday too late on Tuesday.
By eliminating two workouts in one day, the NCAA wants to make it easy for players - paradoxically, training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams end.
This is why the first three trainings of UCLA are scheduled at 19:15 - to be entangled in many students' already so crowded diaries.
For the first time in six seasons that Mora spent in the position of coach in Westwood, Bruins begins training camp a week before last year and training is limited during the summer semester. Its decision to limit the number of training sessions from two to one per day.
A total of eighteen training sessions are scheduled by August 20th, starting formal preparations for the first match against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
It must have been heard that it supports the NCAA decision, although it added another item to the already loaded player's directory.
"Three or four days are players under great stress and it is very exhausting for them," said Mora.
"But no one gave up, everyone's trying. They're great.
I think Saturday, when we have more time, it'll all calm down."
UCLA will be closed after the completion of the training camp, which will not be easy when looking at the clear lines of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and luxury hotel Luskin Center, which was occupied by players after the network has been closed behind the goal pole.
Players Bruins should take the hotel starting this week, but Mora admits that once the rooms are empty during the season, there might be a problem.
"The property will be guarded by the security service," said Mora.
“Safety is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our training.
He's good at dealing with that kind of material.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded as well as parking lot number 8.
We'll use our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything will work out.
It's all planned."
Facebook plans to control facts more thoroughly to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to control third parties and display findings under the original contributions in an effort to fight the so-called "fake news", the biggest social network reported on Thursday.
The company on its website writes that it will use updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes that will send verification results to third parties and potentially display the results of the survey under the original contributions.
Facebook has been identified as one of the main sources of false reports, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports have influenced the presidential election of the United States last year.
In Europe, political debates are taking place. French voters are flooded with the avalanche of false news about the May presidential elections, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network ahead of the September elections if it does not quickly remove angry contributions.
On Thursday, Facebook stated in its next statement in Germany that it is planning to launch a new monitoring function for false reports in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying the reports verified by third parties, people demand more content to be better informed and to be able to make the right decision about what they can share,” said Facebook Product Manager, on her blog Sara Su.
She added that Facebook continues to test the function of “related articles” and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of false reports.
Design of graphic novel: story of A Castle in England
The small castle of Scotland Castle recently played a major role in the music video of the Squeez group, and its refuge was also found in it by Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
However, Scotty was from his cozy spot at the Bewl River in Kent, British, a 700-year-old stormy history that inspired the curly Jamie Rhodes of the York county - known for his fondness in historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"The look at the letter of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me," Rhodes says with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection."
Graphic novels A Castle in England document the life of families who lived in the castle of Scotland from the Middle Ages until the Eduard period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first Rhodes Book of inspired archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired documents from the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was interested in the fingerprint of a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobite," he said.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to light a candle to read.
When I go to the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by the old papers, the support of National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility of spending almost four months in the castle almost as a dream. ("In order to tell the truth, I have extended my stay a little longer.")
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian “new” castle, walking archives, and studying many treasures and curiosity, such as the hyena’s head on the wall and bottles that were thrown down centuries in a ditch.
He walked the land and examined the ruins of the old castle, talked to the rich, gardeners, and sometimes also with artists who worked on illustrations of his book.
"He drank whiskey and wrote it at night."
The reliable history of Scotland is relatively large unknown, since National Trust gained access to documents only in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussein.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff began to enter the archives, which Rhodes described as saying, "The aristocrats of many centuries have scattered with the words, "Put it into the attic."
Journals, letters from the British Empire, maps illustrating property: “You may think that the dispute over land is boring,” Rhodes said, “but I found one case where two families were pulling over the birch.
Stop it, people!
Some stories in the book use the castle as a reflection bridge and dig deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which tracks a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English uprising in 1381.
"I found a record of the rebellion in the castle of 1380, which was called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in the book," Rhodes said.
“The English rebellion actually began in this area and I thought that rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they're somehow connected together."
Other stories are firmly related to the history of the castle - for example The Priest, who tells the story of the Jesuit priest, who had Darrell's family hiding for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about a 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled a coffin of stones (which was discovered only a few years after the discovery of the coffin).
Rhodes’s favorite family is Darrell’s: “I was intrigued by the male generation — the men at the time were always indebted and spent money on things they could not afford.
Various generations of Darrell families have been dealing with this by marrying rich or old ladies - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who were like to roll their heads over to the heirs."
With the end of his stay in the castle Rhodes is looking for other adventures.
Recently, he returned from a two-week station in the Finnish wilderness, where he inspired his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was absorbed by nature.
But it's a very special place for Scotland.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said to myself, 'Now let me go back to the real life.'"
Washington changes the terms of the green card
Media published President Donald Trump's words on the new US immigration plan, which will also change the green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50,000 year-on-year as a result of stricter rules for granting temporary work visas and limiting family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The bill will be submitted to Congress soon.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and we will achieve this by changing the rules of green carding for residents of other countries.
The law limits the number of immigrants and replaces the current scheme.
The new application process is preferred by English-speaking applicants who are imbued with funds and demonstrate the skills that will benefit our country," Trump, quoted by the media, said.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be alert
Just when it seemed that 2017 couldn't be more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sexual robots will appear on the Internet.
Yes.
Sex robots are currently really popular.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots over the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to take the rise of sexual robots seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of robot nails.
"People are pulling out of them, but sales are growing and we need to be ready to see them more and more," Sharkey said on the occasion of the publication of the report.
Modern sexual aids change from bloating you to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course is an artificial intelligence that mimics the behavior of a person.
The user can “adjust” the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
However, it is very disturbing that many robots have their own “personality” that would disgrace the Stepford lady.
Modern inflatable virgins developed into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of RealBotix robot can set up his surrogate wife's character traits, including shyness.
And then there's the sexual robotic woman Roxxxy Gold company True Companion, which is supplied with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah", which is characterized by a shy nature and "wild Wendy" with a "good-for-good" character.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality is set to suit your personality as much as possible,” says True Companion on the website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or “in a mood. ”
The rise of sex robots is alarming immediately for several reasons - among which there is no substitute for real interpersonal relations. Concerns are rather inferior female character traits and violent signs - e.g. frigid (number resisting) Farrah.
True Companion on its website resembles Roxxxy as a vibrator for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why couldn't she have a man Roxxxy?" is written on the page.
However, sexual robots are not just a fetish or a sexual aid.
Their origin and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a shift from ideal or sexual equality to a desire for subtle sex with an elective mark.
Most men obviously do not buy a robotic woman and while the FR is talking about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain at the edge of the public interest.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror of modern times.
And most people aren't weird or violent until they get the excuse for a free market.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women all over the world get their rights, and in the White House there is a president sitting at a woman's address, often very lenient.
The most terrifying aspect of the series The Story of the Servant is not what we see - hung-up bodies and dented eyes, like the reality of these visions.
Book template The story of the maid represents a step in the right direction, but it currently seems to be a small step.
Sex robots have to be as much like real women as possible (at least with pornographic degrees).
Their creators design them so that they are pleasant to touch and act at first sight as a real woman.
However, when it comes to their “personality, ” a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no job, no history, nothing to incite their independence or violate their loyalty to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
It says the 21st century: servants.
NBA star on green armpit.
Curry fights in California about cut.
The star basketball player, Stephen Curry, did not lose sight of the first time in the premiere launch between professional golfers.
Double score holder for the most useful NBA player played at the Ellie Mae Classic Lower Series Web.com Tour in California's Hayward first round at 74 ran and will fight for cut.
The Golden State player, who won the second NBA championship with the Warriors team this season, began very nervously and his first shot ended up in a liquor holder in a golf cart parked at Fairway.
Even after that, he was not as accurate among the pits as under the basketball basket, yet he left behind a dozen professionals with a balance sheet of four wounds above a pair.
"It wasn't the perfect way to start, to have to call the referee right after the first launch, but then it sat down a bit," Curry said, with a tremendous amount of pressure on him.
It was very nervous to fire the first morning of the tournament, but it was everything I had hoped for.
"If you'd told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it right away," he added.
If Curry manages to break through with the cut, which will likely be placed two blows under a pair, he will become the first representative of another sport that the Web.com Tour can do.
"I want to play better next time and now that I've gotten rid of the stress, I hope I can," said an enthusiastic golfer who has played in past tournaments of celebrities and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals.
It's the first time Hayward has started a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he obtained a sponsoring exception and maintained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's great victory?
By contrast, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
The unfailing sign of Trump’s era is political divisions that divide the American voters and cut the whole family to a micro level.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving season, the American newspapers had a lot of advice on how to deal with the relatives who are choosing Trump.
All we're supposed to do is wait for them to give us the nerve.
Less attention is paid, however, to Trump’s ability to build up his family.
I'm talking about this because I was visited in New York this week by my cousin, the poet and fan of the left who lives in Chicago and who has been paying for a Republican fool for a long time in our family.
She reminded me that the semblance in the face of a common enemy could have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden there's a whole family - including all the Republican siblings she's been arguing with about long-term politics - on one wave.
During dinner at the family table, it is a good thing; but I am struck by the fact that it presents a significant risk in the wider context.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we're talking about "normalization" and Trump, we're referring to the terrible possibility that his pranks could lose their attractiveness one day.
However, there is an even more horrendous long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the right-wing republicans, who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly be the embodiment of what can be called rational.
In these today with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitta Romney and his version of crazy talk - a dog on the roof of the car, 14% of the income tax (at least we were aware of his tax returns) - both of which look like very minor offences compared to Trump.
Following Trump's departure, it will be sufficient for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be an enormous improvement.
We used my cousin's visit, and we took the kids to Central Park on the biggest bike running the New York Park Department - you won't find a better use for your three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
Horses are huge, the middle roller is covered with glass-covered clowns and animals are filming and in horror looking at their own shoulders - a completely cloudy view and the tiniest music miraculously reminds public transport.
Many clichés are soon tired: the view from high-rise buildings, the panorama is glancing, instead of breathing on you the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
Fifty years later, I still couldn't get over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not actually Swiss cheese - it does not count the thematic pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but the metro station in London.
However, the wheel in Central Park is a remarkable magical experience, to the extent that two two two-year-olds enjoy it as well as two mature women.
If I could measure the wheel, it would be worth as many points as possible, but luckily no one asks.
This week I experienced similar experience at the store when I was asked to evaluate my “loss note” on a scale of one to five.
At the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same, with the difference that I can add 15% tips for something I buy at the counter.
Not only does it slow down a different fast sale, but the waitress is thus forced to lurk in a decent shoppers when it is not necessary.
The woman at the store smiled at me when I was reluctant to evaluate my credit card transfer with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from the prison to the hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius had to be moved to the hospital.
Last year he was treated for lacerations on his wrist, which, according to the prison, he caused himself to fall in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal against the original conviction for murder.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the door of the toilet cabinet in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that you mistaken her for a thief.
The defendants announced their intention to appeal again, this time against the six - year sentence of Pistorius, who according to their words is too mild.
National Prosecuting Authority stated that it will appeal to South Africa's highest court and the trial will take place this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius is threatened with a 15-year sentence extension.
In South Africa, no death penalty is imposed.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a young man in captivity to a bred panda who mated in the wild.
For the rescue program panda is a huge success.
Because the Centre is trying to expand the genofond panda kept in captivity.
An employee at the Chang Chung Centre told the agency New China that Panda breeding is at great risk from the next of kin.
In captivity, there were only 471 pandas at the end of last year.
In the wild, only two thousand survive.
The effort to let captured pandas mate with those savages is so first step in helping to protect the Panda breed.
The 15-year-old Chao-chao was released into the natural reservation at the beginning of the panda mating period on 11 March.
Thanks to the tracking device on her neck, scientists could observe every step of it.
Chao-chao met his chosen one 12 days later.
The sexual relationship with the panda male lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle because panda males are not considered to be the most successful lover of the animal kingdom.
In addition, males are often confused and do not know what to do.
The young were born healthy and, even since Chao-chao had an unusual appetite during pregnancy, it weighed 216 grams after birth.
The mean weight of the newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in the territory of Greece for illegal camping, citing bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, was detained on August 1st in the morning by the Sithonian police.
They were all released on the same day, but the investigation is continuing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated to bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and impose strict fines on anyone who is arrived at a site where no camping is allowed.
Checks will take place throughout the season.
The Ministry has stated that the court can impose a fine.
Spielková is in the 50th place after the first round of British Open.
Golfist Klára Spilková stands on the first round of the British Open in the divided 50th place.
The court in Scotland of Kingsburns scored one punch under a pair, playing three birdies and twice bogey.
Twenty-two-year-old Czech player is so hopeful that she will be the first to get past the famous Major.
Entering the $3.25 million grant contest came out best to the best American star, Michelle Wie, who won the first round in the 64-thousand, that is, eight in pairs.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are downloading millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has temporarily closed 180 poultry farmers because of the incident.
According to Reuters, the Dutch Food Safety Authority announced that it investigates 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farmers, accounting for 80 percent of the eggs on the market.
The Authority stressed that the risk represents only a limited number of types of eggs identifiable according to specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not present a risk to adults, but the potential threat is for children.
Czech Speaker SVS Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where authorities have joined in the closure of breeds, have not been imported to the Czech Republic recently.
Nevertheless, veterinarians will collect random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on whose markets the problem signs of insecticide have appeared.
According to the veterinary administration of the Czech market, the egg from Belgium was last in April and the egg from the Netherlands in May.
Chicken meat from Belgium appeared in the Czech Republic the last time in June.
But there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands in the Czech Republic.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of products against fleas, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO World Health Organization considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to feelings of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I'll miss her, says Sedláček goalie and she's looking for engagement.
I'd like to catch ten more years.
"Maybe I'll go back there someday," chuckled the 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the Zlinski jersey.
Depends if he gets an engagement at the start of a new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I were to evaluate it as a school, it would be three.
The first year I didn't catch much, I had an experienced goalie in front of me.
I've been studying.
The second year, I started catching.
Three seasons ago, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalie I was meeting again.
Last year, I assumed I'd catch all the time.
But during the opening ten games, we only got five points, so the coaches started rolling.
At the end of the day, my colleague caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it next season.
How was life in Riza?
Beautiful.
It's a little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're three years together, next year we're getting married.
So I brought something.
How difficult is KHL for goalkeepers?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are men like us or Slav who have to change their game style against them.
The skill is on the other hand, so you have to replace it with something.
It means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the breadth of the field.
The difference is, the Russians want to play in the open.
Less shoots, and even though they have a half-empty goal ahead of them, they prefer to record it.
There's only more shooting in the Czech Republic.
Didn't you have a problem traveling and moving across seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can get a good night's sleep.
The program is usually made so that you play maybe four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do the Latvians even feel about their club in KHL?
As a national team.
All of Latvia watches hockey, together with basketball it is a national sport.
Everyone's a fan.
Even though it didn't work out, a lot of people walked.
Did Dinama’s work in KHL help to make Latvia almost a quarterfinal in this year’s world championship?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And since the same time, their performance at the world championship has started to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell in the quarterfinals with Canada just 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to a higher level.
More Latvian players are heading for Czech extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts was established in Zlín, and Ralfs Freibergs is before the contract is signed.
What makes so many of them come here?
They're not any drum players, they're really good.
The teams here are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvia among them.
It's a natural course.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still out of engagement?
By the beginning of February, I knew I wouldn't continue in Riza.
That's when we started looking for something.
There was Sparta on the table.
But because they didn't have a goalie's budget, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams who decided in the finals for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín, and I'm gonna wait for something to come up.
Aren't you nervous about this?
That was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what would happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am home for a while.
I picked something up at the KHL, so I'll take it differently.
The question is, when and where will I sign?
How real is the variant that you're going to ride a new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where it boils down.
Now all I can do is wait for the agent to make a deal.
Do you prefer a contest?
Last season wasn't so I could choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's flight to Flight continues.
In January of this year, I wrote in an article with the care of a proper housekeeper about the camp in Leti near Orlik.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I will allow the difficult passages of the article to be recalled.
There's been talk of a camp in Letty for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what is going on, perhaps it will be best to look, for example, at the official sites of the cultural monuments of the Fifth Place of Leta.
There, in the introduction of the historical overview, the camp stood two kilometres east of the village of Leta, serving as a labor camp since 8: 1940, from 1.1, 1942, it was a collecting camp, and from 2.8, 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including non-human conditions, until March 1943, when the first prisoners of flight were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On 4 May 1943, 370 people were transported to the ironing camp.
The total number was 420.
The very sad history of the great sufferings of human beings that caused them again to human beings and cast away ideology.
There is no dispute that these events are constantly to be recalled.
There is no dispute that this reminder should take place at the memorial site of the suffering of these people.
The problem is somewhere else.
The camp was somewhat forgotten by socialism, and in the 1970s it was close to being built on a part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a monument was discovered in Leti.
In the mid - 1990 ’ s, the government promised to buy and tear down a pig, but it has not yet done so.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration has fallen under Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, he called on the United Nations Committee on Human Rights to close the Czech Republic.
So briefly the facts of the camp's post-war fate.
In the autumn of last year, the government approved the purchase of pork and decided to draw up a substantial assessment to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pig.
According to the Minister of Culture of Herman, "there are some numbers, but I'd probably like to go public with them."
Let's see what the expert opinion says.
According to some unofficial estimates, it can be hundreds of millions; others say it can reach up to billions.
Either way, it's not gonna be a cheap thing.
And yet only a few hundred metres from the former camp stands a monument, to which the state invested nearly ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction was financed by the UN Committee on Human Rights, which is obviously not threatening, I think it would be the same money-laundering.
Doesn't the government have other priorities?
A monument, a worthy Friday place, stands the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the ongoing tragedy, and anyone who wishes can bow to the memory of the suffering and murdered.
I don't see any reason to change that!
Let's just leave it the way it is, and let's keep the hard spot with maximum care.
The entrusted assets, including taxpayers' money, should be dealt with by a responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, with the care of a proper economy.
At least with the one in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister is not the whole government.
However, in the light of the above facts, the password of the leader moves YES only as an empty election proclamation.
This May, I went to look right at the place.
Very decent arrival path, modified parking, replicas of wooden campers.
In one exposure, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with the possibility of sitting and with a view to its own fiery place, which is made of stones placed in a mild slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the importance of this place, as they are and belong.
Archaeological research is currently under way at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, some of the found bases could be preserved and, in an appropriate way, at least visually accessible.
In this direction, the Minister of Culture Daniel Herman could exert himself.
If he succeeds in making a purchase of pig for state money in the government, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already very problematic role as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products may be a nightmare.
However, a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
An incurable disease affecting up to 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes abdominal pain and blood flow, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded to avoid eating meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms. Researchers at Washington University have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in protein helps to create immune cells that support the intestinal resistance.
The head of the study, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure that harmful microbes are removed from the food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
As soon as the bowls bend to the side of the inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
As part of the research, scientists have discovered the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerance in the stomach of a mouse with a specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to create cells.
Professor Colonna put it this way: “We found a link between one type of bacteria — Lactobacillus Reuteri — which is a common part of the gut microbial and the development of cells that support body tolerance.
The more tryptophans had mice in their diet, the more they had these immune cells."
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same is true for man, then the combination of L. Reuters and Triptophan-rich diets would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory bowel environment.
Postgraduate researchers Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas in a study of a certain type of immune cells supporting body tolerance found that one group of test mice lacked these cells, while another group of the same mouse cells separated from the cell.
It led to the fact that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbial — a community of bacteria, viruses, and molds that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
Mouse intestine was tested by DNA classification and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that lacked a second group of mice.
The mice that were kept in a sterile environment and lacked gut microbials - so they did not develop this type of immune cells - were given L. reutera bacteria - and formed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers produced L. Reuters in liquid and then passed on a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immunity cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active substance from the liquid, it was shown to be a secondary product of tryptphan metabolism known as indolyl-3-octin acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of the mice, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent, and after spreading the dose of tryptophan, half the number of cells decreased.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and most of us keep L. Reutera bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether triptophane by-products of L. reutera cause the development of cells in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in the TRIPtofane-related genes were detected in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Every one of us should probably seek the development of these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. Reutera may increase the cell population."
José Mourinho considers signing a contract with Nemnje Matić and his transfer to Manchester United to be “genial”
Manchester United won its team "genia" in the form of Nemanja Matić - at least José Mourinho thinks after the publisher debuted in the Wednesday match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed the contract for £40 million, took the lead in winning 2-1 in Dublin - the last pre-seasonal UEFA Super Cup game, where the United meets Real Madrid on Tuesday - and played his role as a publisher by Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not take part in the team’s pre-season Asian tour, Matić was not in shape and played for only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinha, another season of Prime Minister League needs to be worked on before the beginning of the season.
"It takes time, but it is experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mind - thinks football," said Maureen.
"We'll help him get into shape as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romel Lukak also played the first match at Aviv Stadium and Mourinho began to form his eleventh for the next season.
An independent source this week announced that Maureen still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but insists that the club did a "fantastic job" and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank the club for helping me get three out of four players," he added.
"Four out of four would please me more, but I admit they've done the most for me."
Life's challenge to the King of Chickens, Lady Peanuts.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This promising picture began to be painted thanks to a new show on the TV Prima Zdeněk Academy.
The peacock immediately took a chance.
"Dear Zdenka, I would like to sign up for your cooking academy because, hand to heart, I think I can learn a lot from you," he urged him in a video on a social network.
And since the two of them have been running high for years, the ship hasn't forgotten to tease him this time.
"In return, I can teach you sweaty from diet chicken meat, American cucumbers or invite you to water and show you why it's favorite fried cheese," Pearce snapped.
My participation in Pohlreich's new show is really serious.
It's time to move up and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss said," he told Lightning.
But Pohlreich did not express himself because he was filming new parts of his next show Yes, boss!
Only Prima responded to Phrushka’s participation in the culinary academy by taking the whole matter as his personal activity, which goes off television.
He planted Hruška Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first cook.
In a few days, she sold over 300,000 pieces!
The new show that Prima presented at the press conference yesterday for the autumn broadcast scheme is a fake cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his pupils from a number of audiences, and in 12 parts he introduces them to 12 cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show Now the boss cooks in November 2014 Zdeněk on the back of his trick let him light a crossed pear.
If he had my face there, I'd laugh a lot.
"I'll just smile over this pears - pears are healthy fruit and have plenty of vitamins," the ship responded.
He thinks of Ship's culinary art.
"To cook according to the Lord Peanut doesn't come to mind at home either, because I don't want to have a gastropod at home," the boss clearly has.
Zdeněk Pohlreicha I appreciate very much, even according to him I make chicken on honey.
On my show, however, his recipes will definitely not appear," Hruška did not forgive himself.
He's an asshole!
He's no cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomical analphabetic or moron," said Pohlreich about Hrušk at a lecture.
"I'm not 20 to be able to wave my hands over them, but I'm not solving them anymore," Pear said.
British inventor uses microchip in his hand to unlock car and house by waving
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip mounted to the body. A simple wave of hands can unlock the door to the house and the office and even start the car.
Three-year-old Steven Northam had a small chip implanted between his thumb and his index finger and now offers the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
Dr Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, oversees the procedure of implantation and follow-up of treatment procedures.
Technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted to dogs and cats, and the whole procedure lasts 30 seconds.
Northam’s company also offers a service to exchange locks of doors and cars compatible with the microchip. The price of one castle is £300.
The married father of one child has been able to integrate technology into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which will start with a simple wave of hands.
White House props cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.
The White House decision to fly with a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the American manufacturing industry, which was held last month, came according to Navy records issued by TIME weekly to $24,000.
Green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the highlight of the program from July 17th in the White House, which was a tour of American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and several White House senior officials were watching a show of products from all 50 countries.
The Connecticut helicopter was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
Military officer White House issued a fragmental order, or FRAGO, and requested the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the landing of a helicopter on South Lawn as part of an "emergency" event, the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - the units responsible for the management of the helicopter.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an e-mail to his superior, the representative of the Navy Commander for the Air Force the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter will arrive on South Lawn on 17 July at approximately 7:00 on the occasion of the show, the beginning of which is scheduled to start at 3 p.m. and will remain in place until the entire site, which was scheduled to be cleared between 6 p.m. and 21 p.m.
The e-mail further stated that if there was a delay in leaving the White House, a replacement crew would be dispatched for return flights due to the Working Time Regulation.
The original crew remained on the scene that night, along with the helicopter, along with the security personnel.
From the records - which Time won the week - it was not clear whether the second crew was eventually sent out.
Hatch Act prevents civil servants from exploiting government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating a possible violation of this Regulation.
"We wondered if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was all right," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like they blocked you," the deputy commander wrote.
This show “Made in America” was marked by the White House as an official event and Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the event, the President promoted a health reform that went through the Senate and talked about trying to keep the government regulation in check.
The use of air vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when traveling.
However, their presence is unusual for presentation reasons.
Trump ordered a check in February after a presidential plane was driving in the background at his first assembly in a campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is covered by complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
“The White House is pleased with the exhibition “Made in America”, which presented products from all 50 states that make Americans from American materials,” said press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in the area of Washington and South Lawn and train any arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump participated in the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to the Showcase Made in America was part of the current training of the crew, according to the state figure.
On the same day, a helicopter unit flew into the “non-presidential support missions” for another eleven hours.
The White House stated that there were no other props from the taxpayers' money.
Sikorsky said the company was in no way interested in the South Lawn helicopter construction negotiations.
HMX-1 does not keep the budget records for presidential flights and the exact cost of the tour is difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017, the compensation of the spending of the DoD for VH-3D $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records indicate a time of 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below that amount.
"The costs of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursements are very misleading," Walters said to the whole thing.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual costs."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the compensation for the expenditure of the DoD does not cover the cost of staff, but includes the price of fuel, maintenance and contractual costs.
The then White House White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter for the purpose of the show.
“The idea of the show, which is taking place this week, is to introduce products produced in the USA,” said Spicer.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defence of our state, and that they provide work to hundreds if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we're proud of the helicopter and other military equipment whose production involves countless American citizens.
This is a fact to be remembered."
It is not clear whether Trump was also looking at the helicopter during his trip to South Lawn. For sure only that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House Trump contacted Sikorsky's representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"Sikorski I know very well," the president said, "I own three now."
A young woman was trapped in a swamp near Mácho's lake, and the police were on their way to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday around 2:00 a.m.
Instead of swimming, she stayed trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to ask a police officer for help on her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent of her battery.
"That's why the police lost contact with her soon," police spokesman Ivana Balaková said.
A few police patrols went to the location she described, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the officers had to walk hundreds of metres of oak wet before they felt a solid ground under their feet," Balaková approached.
And she was also missing in the same way.
The officers were guided by the direction in which her call for help was based.
"In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that it would count out loud," the speaker said.
Cops found a woman up to three quarters to five in swamps in Borné locality.
She was at the edge of both physical and psychological forces, and she was seeing signs of a hypothermia.
That's why the ambulance called her to the hospital in Czechoslovakia.
Grandpa's connection to the F.N.A.?
The bride-to-be becomes a sales girl.
That's a little ironic.
It's like a billionaire voter basically says that the STAN suffers from a deficit of decent people.
And he also said that the politically unrelated group of less well-known mayors and independents, in fact, has no national programme for the House elections.
Her election candidate simply becomes a decent person after talking to Grandpa, whatever the political opinion.
He used to start this way and Vít Bart, and it didn't go very well.
In his quest for decent people and personalities, which some mayors will replace on the candidates as well, which Gazdík also admitted, Grandpa also disrupts the popular argument of the STAN boss that the greatest value of the movement is the political scrutiny and experience of mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians, and according to surveys.
They are now slowly changing the rapidly collected unknown personality.
Gazdík also explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on human candidates.
But if the I.D.N.A. suspected only a few at the time, then Grandpa's coming, and he's just playing an identity game.
Not only did Gazdík have long defined himself against ANO Andreje Babiš, but Grandfather, who publicly praises Babiš, said: "My goal is to make the movement YES, then the Old Age movement will gain twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he hasn't mistaken the movement.
Grandpa's a successful businessman, and a billionaire is certainly not a coincidence.
Politics is often spoken of like Babish, but unlike Babish, he does not have his own political brand.
The STAT has long recalled the reality of the show rather than the real political side and Grandfather's helping hand as if it were making a sales girl even more out of the desired bride.
For a while the F.N.A. went with the TOP 09, then with the people and now looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope someone hears from you.
Police dogs practiced helicopter crossings in Mosta
Dogs specializing in explosive detection and hunting dogs have been trained by helicopter crossing Lake Bridge today.
The police dog must not be afraid and be afraid of flying, said the head of police cynologists of the Ústecké region Petr Tomášek.
Police dog training takes about two years.
At Most they practiced as adults trained dogs, so those who are just passing through by training.
In addition to the standard training to detect acute explosive samples and search for the lost figure in the lake, all 12 animals had to enter the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter hits, the dog can go to work so he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter's way.
"The helicopter will happen, the dog will go and look immediately," Tomášek said.
A dog who is restless or on the way to the helicopter is unable to start working immediately is excluded from training.
"Most of them are kept by pseudos, for example, in the garden," added Tomášek.
The police have 76 dogs with various specialties in Ústek Region.
The German sheep dominate, but the Belgian sheep also arrive.
The curse takes care of him from the puppy.
"He raises him himself, prepares him for the service the dog will do for us," added Tomášek.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations that may reveal possible health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and insecure, it consists of the first tests in 20 months.
"It is about two and a half to three years in sharp hit," Tomášek added.
The length of police service depends on the condition of the dog.
Most of them serve up to eight to ten years.
Most of the time, they're living with their pseudos.

According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections may be credible only if all members of the company, including women, are present at the UN representative's headquarters in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women participate in local elections, three women apply for the post of vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said in his mid-term statement.
Elections may be fully representative and credible only if they are attended by women, as well as by any related processes that relate to the elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has announced several threats to the electoral process that pushes international fighting activities to a second turn.
For the first time in this year's elections, a democratically elected government gives its power to the following government.
Haysom said that women's strong roles would strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission stated that of the total 3.6 million registered voters there were 1.2 million women.
A unique brewery is cooking beer again.
For a good beer in a re-emerged brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought back a few years ago to the life of the brewery in Lobč near Mšena.
The brewery, mentioned for the first time in 1586, has a Renaissance core, and in the nineteenth century it was transformed into a steam-powered operation.
Years later, the brewery was famous for its dark beer.
In World War II, unfortunately, production was halted and in 1984 a brewery was born.
Since then, they've served the buildings of a state ship.
The destruction was done by the brewery owners after 1989.
The abandoned area was demolished and dismantled into building materials.
In 2007, however, new hopes came in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzov.
These began repairing buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They carefully devoted themselves and devoted themselves to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and construction elements.
The brewery resembles the 19th century when its golden era began.
Their work was appreciated by the declaration of the brewery for the cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the construction has also become part of the European Industrial Heritage Routes.
In 2015 they also solemnly renewed the tradition of brewing.
To taste great cranial beer in the picturesque region of Kokořínska, visit the extract in the brewery area.
When cooking beer, they use coconut water flowing in protected landscapes, sweets from cranial fields, and jaundice hops.
In the extract you will taste a traditional light bed, but also dark beer and specialties.
And don't miss the brewery, it's on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and at half past noon.
The biggest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the greatest forts of its kind on a global scale?
The Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and Žacler, at the top of the local cemetery over the village of Babí, was to be a unique building.
Initially, it was to be made up of up to twelve bunkers connected to a vast underground.
Here should be the headquarters, the barracks, ammunition warehouses, materials, power plants, machinery and hospitals.
But the building was completed by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, he was able to build a single massive concrete bunker and the underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the fans from the Stachelberg Association, who began to rebuild a unique building in the early 1990s, you can also see here.
The underground is now available from 75 percent!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry cabin with exposure and underground and an armed building of light fortification, there are two dedicated infantry cabins, trenches and the scientific trail of Mounted Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, cozy alternator and stunning views of the landscape guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech construction was listed next to such monuments as the Great Wall of China, the Traian port at Rome or the Assyrian palace in Nineveh and Nimrud.
Chotěšov Monastery originally from the beginning of the 13th century, which today consists mainly of a mighty four-point building of a convention over a beautiful garden.
The list he made, but unfortunately, belongs to unique buildings that are threatened with extinction.
But the enthusiasts don't want to give up, and a lot of action is being held in support of the monastery.
One of them is the next year for the Chotěšov Monastery this Saturday of August 5 where Vladimír Misík, Ivan Glass, will see the Šermír performance and look at the places of beautiful large buildings that are usually inaccessible.
But you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Chef Miroslav Kalina will cook, taste culinary specialties and regional food, enjoy musical and dance performances, rich program for children such as creative workshops, theatre, jumping castle, Smurfy competition road and, of course, a number of competitions.
Get to know the plant with one click.
The new free Pl@ntNet app will help students with the creation of herbarians and ordinary plant lovers.
When they are interested in what kind of plant they just hit on a walk, these applications will advise them.
The only thing they have to do is take a picture of the plant, and the apps themselves recognize what kind of plant it is.
The new application, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Centre for Ethics and Environmental Education in Bratislava Horsky Park as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
The project included pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who with teachers in the application database photographed and added plants from their surroundings.
The newly created French application is free to download on the Secret Life of the City.
The main goal of the French programmers was to make the most of the people contribute to the application with their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Children who hold tablets or cell phones in their hands can go into the forest," said coordinator of this project Ivan Poláčková.
Based on a sufficient quality photo of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name within seconds, which will then be placed under the photograph in Czech and Slovenian.
The French allowed us to translate the secret life of the city into Slovenian and Czech.
It is therefore welcome that users contribute to the application after setting up the account with a picture of a plant that is not yet present in the database.
"The French will assess if it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Poláčková informed.
GMB concerns about investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The boards require insurance from the manager of McVitie's biscuit manufacturer on the long-term obligation of production at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish trade union GMB said that the company is still silent about any investment in the Tollcross factory.
The factory employs more than 500 employees who produce, among other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, stated that over the past few years she had invested more than 5 million pounds in the whole area.
He added that staff and trade union representatives would be ‘between the first informed’ in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the construction company, the Scottish boards of the GMB expressed their concerns that McVitie's "will not get its promises to finance and modernise production lines."
GMB’s chief organizer Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have no clear answers from the builder about the company’s needs and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very disturbing for our members.
Many families have worked here, and the employees are mostly from the local community and Glasgow, where work in this factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the field of high unemployment and social exclusion.
From the point of view of work, wages and benefits - and despite the outlook on Brexit, rising costs of life and declining slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer, such as McVitie's."
Pladis spokeswoman said: “Tollcross’s landlord received a letter from GMB just yesterday, and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we appreciate the continuing commitment towards employees and union representatives.
Regular meetings with employees and representatives of GMB in Tollcross were held two months ago and many problems were discussed openly at this meeting.
We spoke to the employees that, as in all companies operating under extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our regular operation, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years we have invested £5 million in Tollcross, especially in production lines and efficiency.
We greatly appreciate the Tollcross heritage and the locality, and any changes in the operation of the factory will be immediately informed by the employees and representatives of the trade unions."
Did she warn PSG Barcelona about the move of Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow in its attempt to get Neymara to her side after she made 189 million pounds, that is, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the contract, but warned this French team of Barcelona about its record raid three years ago?
The League 1 Club is ready to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for Paul Pogby’s transfer to Manchester United, which paid £89 million for it last season.
After confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and at the same time the best paid professional athlete in the world - after tax he will collect over £500,000 per week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is indignant at the way Neymar got out of his contract, despite the fact that the confidential source confirmed that the club has always tried to meet Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But has the football world been alerted to this three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City in 2014 expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the club that they would be interested in stopping one of the best PSG players.
"I'm not afraid because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we will certainly address one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the imaginary border when she expressed interest in PSG's publisher Marc Verratti in the summer.
The PSG made it clear in that it would under no circumstances allow the Italian representative to leave, and it is therefore possible that Barcelona will now swallow the bitter pill with Neymar's departure for its tropics.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have wide-ranging rules?
Donald Trump nodded on anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Madura.
And even a day earlier, Trump wrote that China is not doing anything about the North Korean threat, and that's not going to happen.
Even that leaves the idea of sanctions as a shoe straw.
Those things can't be thrown in one bag.
Madura's Venezuela really went on the road to dictatorship, totally.
China just doesn't behave as the American president would have liked.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if someone wanted to sum it up in such a way that even the ordinary electorate, American, European or other, understood what the system of rules is and what the policy of sanctions is based on, the task would be almost impossible.
In the sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only reaching out to what President Obama has already set up, only to give an implementation stamp.
Then why all the fuss?
Last year, Europe was afraid that if we won the American election Trump, we would hug Putin and withdraw the sanctions.
That's a terrible idea.
But in practice, it's the other way around.
Trump and I don't release sanctions until they're tightened up.
But Europe is scaring even more.
German Minister Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
Is it like kosher is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are neither kosher nor anti-Russian EU sanctions.
Commissioner Juncker, again, complains that Trump's sanctions threaten EU energy security.
Like they're supposed to use sanctions just so weak that they don't threaten anyone?
A common voter melts.
For three years, he heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depended solely on the implementation of the Minsk peace agreements in Ukraine.
It is now known that it is the EU's energy security.
The voter melts and spreads.
There are sanctions coming to Russia for putting too much of it where it doesn't have it.
China's lost its weight for a little bit of assembly.
The Venezuelan President is being punished for building a dictatorship within the borders of his country.
All the punishments or nothing but consideration have their rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the rules or the rules?
Andrej Babiš: I do not think about cooperation with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, crosses the Republic with his visionary book and finalises the election program.
Besides the Pardubice Region, he's already got all the candidates ready.
In his own words, he did not intervene significantly in them.
He even agreed to have Haytman and Shadow Education Minister Ana Ivo Vondrák lead the Moravskoslezski.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a Member or a Haytman," Babiš confirmed his earlier opinion.
You've upset a lot of representatives and national politicians that directly elected mayors should run the municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I'm a fan of direct democracy, we're calling directly on the president, and I'm convinced that we should also elect mayors and prime ministers.
In my book, I'm not talking about breaking the reps, they might as well be there.
The question is, how many will there be?
When I was presenting your book, what am I going to dream about when I happen to sleep, I heard you were talking about canceling the representations on your own.
I don't remember.
I was talking about direct election and reduction of representations.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague has 1171 representatives with 1.2 million citizens.
And it's hard for the primate to build and prepare big projects, but she doesn't have the authority to do that.
The same applies to a government ruled by only two people, Klaus and Zeman, in our history.
Which I'm not saying was good.
The current prime minister doesn't drive anything, he's just moderating the debate.
Then it can't work.
Is that why you want to enforce the majority system?
He'd be perfect, but it's hard to say.
All we have in the program is a change to a one-wheel election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a slippery mandate of ministers and the regulation of the House's Rules of Procedure to prevent unnecessary exhibitions of Members, who are to work mainly on committees and committees, not to show up at meetings of the House.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are worried about.
That as a dictator you will run the government, control the House with 101 Members, cancel the Regions and the Senate, and by means of grateful mayors and primators you will dominate the whole country.
I'm sure it's not.
There is nothing wrong with discussing the number of Members.
French President Macron reported a reduction in the legislature of a third, while there is 57 000 French lawmakers, while 17,000 Czechs.
However, no one blames Macron for threatening democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won the election mostly, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making dramatic changes.
However, the funds for the majority of parliaments are large, only to look in Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like that in the case of the YES movement is threatening.
We just need a team in the government to work for people, not for our parties or departments.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree that only the salaries of teachers, employees in culture and social services would increase.
Why was I outvoted and added by 21 percent to the Gibbs who are now taking 60,000?
Would you go crazy about that as Prime Minister?
The prime minister is to intervene when ministers are misbehaved, mix with the government with the travel agency, and for the money of the state they would like to do as Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers don't fight in the government, they're supposed to talk out of it.
The cabinet must have finished material, there is no place for coalition breakups, strong voting and business, there is to decide.
How do you want to keep a team together when the ministers are acting mainly on the sidelines?
There is constitutional law above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition contract did not apply, and he left Babish out of the government.
That's what any prime minister can do.
However, if he is a person and has control skills, a similar planal gesture is not needed.
It measures everyone equally, and it requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you would suggest to the Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it at all, because we probably won't be in the government, and no one wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done so badly.
There's not so much skepticism in place.
The mayors have acquired the entrepreneur Grandfather, who would like to cooperate with you, perhaps to win the wing of the favored George Chunk with the people.
I don't think so.
ČSSD leads Lubomír Zaorálek, which does not rule out coalitions with ANO, Václav Klaus ml., which is also not against.
I'd leave it at the polls.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President ANO Richard Brabec said you have many points in common with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the area of economics.
So the Okamurs come to mind as a coalition partner?
Mr Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, ran as a VV VV Víta puppet, then got money from Christmas for his company, ran a coup.
Of course, he's a distinct personality.
It's kind of brown, though.
When I take his program, he's got a broad involvement in society control, direct democracy, and that's what we can agree on.
That's not what I'm asking you.
I wonder if you find a person who has xenophobic opinions to speak at the gallows demonstrations and wants to step out of the EU acceptable to you?
We don't consider working with Mr. Okamura's side, I can't imagine.
Obviously, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the communists to your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating a winner with another in order, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be the two.
Of course, it is important that they be able to agree on a coalition government programme.
Let's go back to your drive as a company.
But the government just has to drive, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything go away, never decided.
Coalition issues such as CEB or EGAP have not worked.
Because Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that was also why he fired me.
As soon as he did, CEZ ruled the Czech government.
After all, it is incredible that the Prime Minister has delivered a resolution written by the CEZ, which is keeping the Minister of Finance as he is to vote in the CEZ General Assembly.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change the staff ratios in the Supervisory Board and change the top management of ČEZ?
Jesus, if I'm the Prime Minister, I'll see you.
I'm not that guy yet.
Rumor has it that CEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with ČSSD would like to trade for even better with YES.
So, after the election, everything goes on again.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have any humble lobbyist or Rose, I'm a separate unit, and I'm not dealing with this at all.
So answer directly.
If you stand at the head of the government, will you seek to exchange the management of ČEZ, Czech TV or General Health Insurance, the institutions you criticize?
I want CEZ to be a transparent company.
You've been doing what you wanted for years, thanks to the commission for the traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look at Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he's supposed to be in CEZ majority, he never drove it, he was only there to the number, which is wrong.
It's a trivial thing to me.
ČEZ is to take Dukovany, value them, put them in a subsidiary company, arrange funding, make a supply competition or find a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state is to finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And the Czech TV?
Some of her shows against me run a permanent campaign of purpose, but I don't have and I won't have any competence to throw anyone away.
But to control it, yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about 7.2 billion a year for public and television bills, but they don't really know how these institutions operate.
How come they don't know?
The House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the Directors-General of the Czech Republic and Czech Republic.
Look at the way these reports are going, the super power pact Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
It pays for the current parliamentary commission to escape from the investigation files, as well as lex babish.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he got Calousk to push me out of the government, which played a percentage of TOP 09, but the ČSSD stripped them.
They're afraid of disrupting their corruption system, and that's how they talk about threatening democracy to Babish.
No one's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first Vice-President, YES Jaroslav Faltínek, builds a powerful background by placing his son on the Supervisory Board of Tepláren Brno and arranges a related lawyer, Kvetoslav Hlín, a contract with city and state companies such as the Prague Transportation Company or the Czech Railways?
There's a constant dispute in that.
I don't like it, and I've misinterpreted it several times.
Faltynek argues that the lawyer in question works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As Minister of Finance, I didn't have anyone.
We, unlike the Socans, have never had a corruption affair, no Pelt, no Short Wave, no Březin.
If we had any sign of clientalism, we immediately fired such a person.
I'm uncompromising in this way.
If something like this happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
