Welsh members of the congregation are concerned about similarities with "The Muppets"
Some members of the assembly are dismayed by the proposal to change their title to "members of the Welsh Parliament" (MWP).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the political spectrum are concerned that they might become the subject of ridicule.
A Labour member said his group was concerned "because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers of van Wells: On Welsh twp means silly, and pwp means feces.
A member of the assembly from the Plaid political party said the group as a whole "is not satisfied" and suggested alternative names.
A member of the Welsh conservative party said his group was "open" to change its name, but noted that there was a small difference between the terms of the MWP and the Muppets.
In this context, the Greek w pronunciation is similar to that of Yorkshire English.
The assembly commission, which is currently working on a draft law on the introduction of name changes, said: "The final decision on the titles of the Assembly members will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
The law of the government of Wales from 2017 gave the Assembly authority to change the name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a public debate on proposals resulting in a great deal of support for the appointment of the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of members of the assembly, the commission preferred the name of members of the Welsh Parliament or of the MPP, but the option of the MWP received the most support in public debate.
The members of the assembly reportedly make alternative proposals, but efforts to reach consensus could give the headaches to President Elina Jones, who is expected to hand over the draft law on changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other amendments to the way the Assembly functions, including the rules on disqualification of members of the Assembly and the Commission's plan.
Members of the congregation will have the last opportunity to vote on their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians go to a referendum on the name change of state
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
A popular vote was organised in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been claiming for longer that the name of its northern neighbour represents the occupation of its territory and is persistently opposed to its EU and NATO membership requirements.
Macedonian President Gjordje Ivanov, a plebiscite opponent for changing the title, said he would not recognise the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, consider the change of name simply a price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
The bells on St. Martin were silent as the Harlem churches struggle to survive
"The older people I spoke to say there used to be bars and churches on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today there is neither one nor the other."
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are hanging out differently today," he said.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood living quarters where people go on a regular basis."
As for the church, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the managers expect, "and sooner or later, it will return to where they started."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings full of people who will not help preserve the remaining Quarterly shrines.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that is why closing these churches will be accelerated because it is unlikely that the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The original community of white Methodists moved out in the 1930s.
A black community that worshiped nearby took possession of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black community led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, the main trading street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
In 1939, fire damaged the building very badly, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made a restoration plan, they ordered organ.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the organ "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the organ in July called them different: "cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical instrument."
A specialist at Tiffany Ng University in Michigan also pointed out that these were the first organ in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger organ in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said the Church of St. Martin had not found him a replacement.
What has happened in St. Martin's Church in the last few months is a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of which were brought by church chiefs and other bishop bishops.
The bishop’s administration – an administrative body of the bishops, composed of church chiefs – wrote to the bishop in July, expressing concern that the bishop would "try to transfer expenses" to the bishop’s administration, although the bishop’s administration was not involved in renting architects and entrepreneurs sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the bishop.
Shark hurt 13-year-olds during lobster hunt in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting lobsters in California on the day of the lobster hunt, officials said.
The attack happened seven hours ago in the morning by Beacon's Beach Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy calling for help and then he and the group rowed up to him and helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was about the excitement of catching lobster, but then he "found out that he was yelling 'it bit me!'
She's got me down!
His entire collarbone was torn apart," Hammel said he noticed when he reached the boy.
"I urged everyone out of the water, 'The shark is in the water!'," Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Pediatric Hospital of the Council where his condition is being conducted as critical.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked him.
The rescue officer, Captain Larry Giles, told the media that the shark had already been spotted in the area weeks earlier, but that it was found that it did not belong to a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries in the upper hull area.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach beach in Casablanca to Swami's beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the beauty market in Britain
Sainsbury's becoming a competition of Chains Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams to department cosmetic products in the style of department stores in which expert assistants work.
As part of a significant breakthrough in the beauty market in Britain worth 2.8 billion pounds, which is on the rise as sales on fashion markets and household equipment declines, the larger cosmetic departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will be extended to more stores next year if they are successful.
Investment in cosmetic products comes from the fact that supermarkets find ways to use shelves that are once used for televisions, microwaves and household equipment.
Sainsbury's said he would double his cosmetic assortment by offering more than 3,000 products, including brand products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw for the first time.
Existing product palettes of L'Orreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in departments like those in stores like Boots.
Supermarket will also restart its Boutique make-up line by making most products suitable for vegans – something that younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume shop will test the outlets in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which was opened in Croydon, in southern London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping on the network and moving towards daily shopping of small quantities of food in local shops means that supermarkets have to make additional efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of the Sainsbury's chain, said the stores would look more and more like department stores in a supermarket effort to strike back with chains with high discounts to Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened the Argos department in hundreds of its stores, and also introduced the Habitat departments since they bought both chains two years ago, which says it increased the sale of food products and the profitability of the purchase.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to modernise its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments ended infamously.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 2000s, but this partnership ended with a dispute over the distribution of pharmaceutical revenues in their stores.
The new strategy came into effect after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281 pharmacy to Célesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds.
It has been said that Lloyds will play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of the Sainsbury's chain, said: "We have transformed the appearance and experience of our beauty departments to give our customers a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at hand to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and an attractive environment and practical location means that we are now an inevitable destination of the beauty market that sets new standards in relation to the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million deal
The Dragons Dan star, Peter Jones, is "angry" after the television host Holly Willoughby withdrew from the deal with his 11 million-pound personal brand to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of home and extra equipment, Truly.
The company of this couple is compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The director of this Morning (37) announced her departure through Instagram.
Holly Willoughby pissed off the Dragons' Dan Peter Jones star by pulling from their profitable brand at the last minute – to focus on her new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "angry" when a golden television girl confessed, during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, the Buckinghamshire area, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, meant that there was no time left to devote to their brand of home and extra equipment, Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and predicted to double Willoughby's wealth, estimated at £11m.
When Willoughby (37) announced her departure on Instagram, Jones flew from Britain to one of his cottages.
The source said, "Holly put Truly at the top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan that would ensure her profit over the next few decades.
Her decision to pull the plug was a shock to everyone involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to launching.
In Marlowe's headquarters there's a warehouse full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that going to this Morning, one of the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions because of huge investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and home equipment, and possible additional delays in the launch date.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp's 2016, and Jones (52) joined in March as the company's director.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has 40% stakes in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become ambassador to the brand M&S and will replace Anta McCorlin as the host of the I'm A Celebrity ITV show.
A source close to Jones last night said, "We wouldn't comment on his business."
Hard words, 'and then we fell in love'
He joked about the criticism he could get from the media because of comments that could characterize himself as "non-presidential" and because of the positive attitude about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said with his funny voice, "the news reader."
"I didn't give in at all."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump declared their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step forward towards North Korea's denuclearisation.
But the denuclearisation negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see "an adequate response" by the United States to the initial steps of North Korea towards disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his speech at the rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were one step away from the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have great relations."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results -- stopping rocket tests, releasing hostages and returning the remains of American soldiers.
And he stood in defense of his unusual approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's easy to act presidentially, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the world in front of him.
Tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island by killing hundreds
After an earthquake on Lombok Island, for example, foreign NGOs were told that no assistance was needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok Island has been displaced, the state of national disaster has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for obtaining international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it will be quite difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children's organization is putting together a team to travel to Palo, they're still not sure if foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the agency for national disasters, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation on the island of Pal to see whether international agencies should be allowed to participate in the provision of assistance.
In view of the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, it is regrettable how unprepared this country is for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, they are not often seen on other parts of the coast.
Apparently, there was no tsunami siren on Pal Island, although the warning was in effect, so it also contributed to the loss of life.
And in ideal conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship anchored in Lombok to help the earthquake victims is on their way to Pala, but it will take him at least three days to get to the scene of the new accident.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's long-standing infrastructure and did not save money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has affected Mr. Yoko's administration while he expects new elections next year.
Mr. Yoko is also under pressure because of long-standing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives, and tens of thousands were displaced by the street fights of Christian and Muslim groups using machetes, bows, and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Footballer Daniel Sturridge inserted a deep match against Chelsea's football club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing in the Premier League by a score of 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a ball from Xherdan Shaqiri at about 30 yards from the Chelsea naked club while his team lost 1:0.
He transferred the ball to his left side, and then he dumped it on the outside of the statue.
The ball flew high above the penal space turning towards the upper right corner of the network.
In the end, she fell over Cap Arrisabalga, who was in a jump and fell into the net.
"It was only until positioning, until receiving the ball, and players like Shaq always go ahead as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturrudge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched her once, and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
In the 5th attack, the blue attacker added the ball to Mateo Kovacic before running from the middle of the field to Liverpool's half.
The blacksmith quickly touched and returned the ball in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, pointing Hazard into the penal space.
Hazard was faster than the defense and ended up near the statue by inserting in the net with his left leg next to Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool is fighting against Napoli at the Champions League group stage at three o'clock Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays videoton in the League of Europe at three o'clock Thursday in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami reached 832
The number of victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, a state disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many crowded people were reported in the ruins of buildings that collapsed an earthquake of 7.5 which occurred on Friday and raised waves high and up to 20 feet, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the press conference, said.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with the remains of the demolished buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
Forty-four-year-old girl was found stabbed at 7:55 in the morning at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a thirty-two-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of committing murder.
The police called in people who saw or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is early, but I'm inviting everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also invite everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the car control panel, to contact us because they may have information that is important for the investigation."
Police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found from Birkenhead and was found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the front of the room to inquire about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and police said they were in the process of informing the victim's family.
The taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The tenants are now told they'll have to wait hours before they're allowed to go back inside.
They heard a cop tell a man that the entire zone was considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene of a crime in tears.
She kept saying, "This is so horrible."
At 14:00, two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van just outside.
A large number of police officers were inside the police cordon overseeing the building.
All those with any information are invited to contact @MerPolCC directly, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111 citing case 247 from September 30th.
The Cromwell Statue in Parliament has become the newest monument in the middle of a "review of history"
Her removal would represent poetic justice for the destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England carried out by his Puritan followers in the manner of the Taliban.
But Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "trying to revise history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate on the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's character in front of the Westminster Palace becomes a target.
Cromwell did not order, nor did he carry out iconic warfare during the English civil wars.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestors Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of an opinion from the nineteenth century and part of the histography of a character that many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell many consider, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than today, the protector of parliament from external pressure, in his case of the monarchy.
Whether this is entirely true is the subject of a permanent historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid - 17th century shaped the further development of our nation and that Cromwell was a recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of glory and memory."
The killer pig caused death to a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in Southwestern China, local media reported.
A man, only known as Yuan, was found dead with severed artery and covered in blood in a pig market in the city of Liupanshui in the Guizhou area, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepared to inject a vaccine into pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
Apparently, he arrived with his cousin from the nearby Yunnan area on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found out that the door of the next pig was open.
He said there was a big man pig with blood around his mouth.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that piglets weigh 550 pounds to the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and dismembered," said a relative who introduced himself by his last name Wu, broadcasts Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera record shows Yuan who came to the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that a pig was locked up to prevent attacks on other people while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market owners are reportedly negotiating damages for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported before.
The pig attacked her wife and her husband in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig attracted a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife frightened and drove away.
After the pigs ate the Oregon farmer in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "challenge".
"They're just playing.
They like pinching, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring widespread splashes to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa has weakened moving beyond the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring floods due to showers across northern Mexico and in the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
The first category of hurricane winds reached a speed of 85 miles an hour from 5 a.m. to the east on Sunday, and was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a gap is forming in the Pacific Ocean and is moving towards the east and west coast of the United States. As the tropical storm of Rosa approaches the Bay California peninsula on Monday, it will begin pushing tropical moisture north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain into parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture along with the coming gap will create widespread rains in the southwest in the following days.
Between 1 and 4 inches [4 inches] of rain will result in floods, sediments and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical moisture will result in rainfall that will reach locality and 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Even 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in the southwest, especially in the larger part of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of the sudden deterioration of weather conditions and the typical spread of tropical rain.
On foot trips to the desert would be extremely thoughtless with the danger of tropical rains.
The heavy rain in the canyons could result in raging rivers, and the thunderstorm could result in local strong winds and sandstorms.
The incoming gap will bring local splashes to the parts of the coast of Southern California.
The total rainfall of over half an inch is possible, which could cause application and slippery Augustes.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the region.
Rooms scattered by tropical rain will reach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain gets more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
The showers will reach Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue throughout Wednesday.
In October, there may be major temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic gets colder and the tropics continue to stay quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short intervals.
There is an excellent example of a dramatic temperature difference in the Central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference in Kansas City, Missouri and Omahi, Nebraska, and between St Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the remnants of summer heat will again try to buy and expand.
At the beginning of October, it will be warm in most central and eastern parts of the United States with temperatures of about 80 degrees from the southern plains to the parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast announces a huge possibility of temperature above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's exciting testimony before the High Court and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurring in 1980, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political resistance continues, with broadcasters disrupting regular broadcasts due to the latest plot on Friday: an agreement Senator Arizona Jeff Blake made with the FBI on a one-week investigation of the indictment.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that he was 100% sure that he was drinking Kavanaugh's tap and tried to get dressed at a high school party.
In a passionate confession, Kavanaugh said he was 100% sure that it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this was probably seen by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company used CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not available immediately for other networks that broadcast this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble getting people to track the transmission from the office.
To be better enchanted, it is an audience similar to the one that follows football elimination matches or Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose editors supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led in front of other networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest is high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After a moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded footage of protestors yelling at him after trying to enter the elevator to attend the hearing of the judicial commission.
He stood looking down for a few minutes while being insulted, with live feeds on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the earth?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said before the elevator closed, he had more to say at the commission's hearing.
Cable and television networks were broadcast live hours later while the judicial commission voted on whether to forward Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on condition that the FBI investigates the charges against the appointed next week, as called for by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's choice was significant because it was obvious that the Republicans wouldn't have had enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests in an interview with the daily Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a conservative party conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In her second interview on the front page, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal was that Britain and the EU take customs from one another "all absurd".
Wayde Sims' murder: Police arrested Dytheon Sampson, the LSU's death suspect
Police arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the LSU club.
Dytheon Simpson (20) was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials released a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson, and police said Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
Police took glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, the WAFB network reports.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to killing Wayde.
His bail is $350,000, the lawyer said.
The Eastern Baton Rouge morgue issued a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot to the head and neck.
The department said the merits belonged to a police task force for Louisiana fugitives, the criminal laboratory of the state police, the Southern University police and the residents of the area that helped during the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of LSU Joe Alleva thanked the district law enforcement agency for his "pathy and the pursuit of justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The attacker, six feet tall and six inches tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at the LSU club.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per match.
Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach said the team was "desperate" and "in shock" for Wayde's death.
"This is what we're always worried about," Wade said.
Volcano blasting ash on Mexico City
Ashes blazing volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Sunday to stay at a safe distance after volcanic activity in the crater increased after 183 emissions of gas and ash were registered in 24 hours.
The center followed more earthquakes and rumblings.
The images on social media show a thin layer of ash covering windshield cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased volcanic activity 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since the 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after protestors, supporters of independence, clashed with a special police squad, when thousands of people joined the counter-demonstrations on marking the anniversary of the polarising Catalan secession referendum.
A group of masked Separatists, detained by a special police squad, threw eggs and powder paints at them, making dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, riots broke out with the police who used their pendulums to contain the fight.
In the course of several hours, independence supporters have chanted "No forgetfulness, no forgiveness" and have clashed with union supporters who called out "Lifes of Spain".
Fourteen people received a medical treatment for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local press reported.
Tensions are still high in the region, which was determined for independence a year after the referendum of the first October, which Madrid declared illegal but which Catalan separatists celebrate.
Voters chose independence by a vast majority, although the turnout was low because macho secession opponents boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop the vote by violent clashes across the region.
Advocacy groups camped Friday night to prevent demonstrations and to support the national police.
The demonstrations were still held, but they changed the route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness because they were allowed to vote, but now we're in trouble," he said.
Although they took a crucial but close victory in the local elections last December, the Catalan parties that advocated independence had difficulty maintaining momentum because some of their most famous leaders were in self-imposed exile or in custody, awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old car mechanic who filmed a police support protest on the phone, said politicians on both sides were backing up the conflict.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been detained since the end of last year, announced his candidacy in elections for the European Parliament next year.
"Contesting in the European elections is the best way to condemn the backlog of democratic values and repression imposed on us by the Spanish authorities," he said.
Londonderry: Males arrested after car crash in the house
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested after being hit by a car several times in a London-Derry house.
The incident took place on Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 a.m. British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blommmings said the gate was damaged just like the building itself.
There's a possibility that at one point a car was shot from a crossbow.
Menge's score to Livingston has won 1-0 against Rangers.
Dolly Menge's first goal secured a victory for Livingston
Advanced Livingston surprised the Rangers and recorded only another loss for Steven Gerrard at 18 Ibrox clubs.
Dolly Menge's goal was crucial, while Gary Holt's club was tied to the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's club didn't record any victory in the Premier League this season and will play against the first-place Hearts behind eight points next week.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid from Vienna in the European League match Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone has extended a series of league victories to six matches, and chief coach Holt hasn't experienced defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed an opportunity against guests who lacked sharpness
Holt's team was supposed to be in charge long before they scored because their direct play was very problematic for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but his attempt went straight past the goal, and then Alan Lithgrove's attempt went past the goal after he skated to get the ball Craig Halkett took to the goal.
The hosts were good enough to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could create problems for the guests from free kicks.
And that's how the key goal is scored.
Free shot against Rangers, Livingston made a pass, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Manga, who received the ball and shot from the middle of the criminal space.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the defense host remained impenetrable and goalie Liam Kelly didn't have much trouble.
That pattern continued in the second half, even though Kelly had to intervene for Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman was stopped by a goalie named Ranger Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was kicking too wide from another free blow to Livingstone.
Crosses kept coming into Livingstone's penal space and were constantly defended, while the two pens they were looking for – one after fouling Glenn Middleton's replacement player and the other due to the game – were not awarded.
"Phenomenal Game" Livingstone – Analysis
BBC journalist Scotland, Aladdair Lamont is in Tony Macaroni Arena
Awesome game and Livingston score.
All of them were excellent and continue to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their style of play and players almost haven't changed since their return to the top, but big credit belongs to Holt, who's been giving energy to the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading an excellent organized defense, while Menga gave Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall peace throughout the match.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were under Gerrard's bat from time to time, they didn't reach that level.
Final punches were missing – they only broke through the hosts once – and this is the kind of wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Mixed reception for Erdogan in Cologne
Saturday (September 29th) was a sign of a smile and blue sky while the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving NATO's relations.
They differed on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU entry.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
This is the city with the largest number of Turks out of Turkey.
Police cited security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed to Erdogan – many of them Kurds – were also loud, condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The double protests reflect a split in opinion of a guest that some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others resent him for being an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bicyclist killed in a car crash
A biker died in a car crash in London.
There was a crash near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a road road in Deptford, southeast of town, about 10:15 a.m. in British time.
The driver stopped and intervened with the ambulance team, but the man was killed on the spot.
The crash occurred a few months after another cyclist died in the accident in which the driver left the scene of the accident, on Childers Street, about a mile from the site of the Saturday accident.
The London police said they were working on identifying the victim and informing the family.
The streets are closed, the buses are diverted, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six employees injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured in riots in a high-security prison for men, the Prison Office said.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin prison, in Worcestershire area, on Sunday around 9:30 a.m. in British time and still continue.
A special squad of Tornado officials has been called upon to calm down riots involving eight wards in one wing of prison.
Officials have suffered minor injuries and help has been provided on site
A spokesman for the prison administration said: "We have deployed specially trained prison staff dealing with an incident in the Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members got medical attention for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could extend their prison sentences."
In Long Lartin prison, more than 500 prisoners were placed, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, a prison warden was reported to have been admitted into hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October a special squad was called to prison for serious riots in which staff were attacked by billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (which can be useful in drought-affected areas)
Rarely when tropical depression hits Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen at the beginning of next week while Hurricane Rosa with her remaining energy passes through the desert southwest, carrying the risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Administration has already issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona and South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and her approach on Monday night will announce the rain.
The National Meteorological Authority in Phoenix tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest projections of the National Urban Centre predict 2 to 4 inches of precipitation, and in isolated parts of Mojollon Rome in Arizona and up to 6 inches.
In other parts of the desert south-west, including the central part of the Rockies and Great Basin chain, it will most likely be 1 to 2 inches, possibly up to 4 inches in isolated parts.
In areas where there is no fear of floods, Rosa’s rain could be a blessing because the area was hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, one part of these rainfall will probably be useful because the southwest is currently hit by drought.
According to the US drought control agency, slightly over 40 per cent of Arizona was hit at least by extreme drought, the second highest category," said weather.com.
First, on his way, Hurricane Rosa will lead to a rink on the Mexican Peninsula of Bay California.
Rosa, who will still have 85-mile-an-hour winds on Sunday morning, will be 385 miles south of Punt Eugenia in Mexico and will be moving at 12 miles an hour.
The storm will reach the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, and that's why it will begin to wane.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or at night.
Showers in parts of Mexico could be very strong and can pose a great flood risk.
"The total rainfall of three to six inches is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and perhaps even up to 10 inches," said the weather.com.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico with the force of a tropical storm before she gets to Arizona early on Tuesday morning in the form of tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and South Utah on Tuesday late at night.
"The main danger expected from Rose or her backdrops are the large showers in Baja California, Northwest Sonori and the US Southwest Desert," the National Centre for Hurricanes said.
These showers are expected to cause lush floods dangerous for life and rain in the deserts, as well as mountain ranges.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenager was found injured near Excelsior Terrace Street in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4 a.m. British time.
He was taken to the hospital and in stable condition.
Seventeen-year-olds, 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested in the Radstock area, police said from Avon and Somerset.
Officials are urging those who have any recording of the events on their mobile phone to come forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the fall and rage" of a democratic party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the cruel and outrageous tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a rally in Whelling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the passion and anger" of a democratic party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims that he sexually assaulted several decades ago while they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his charges.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the glory, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for confirming one of the most realized legal minds of our time, a lawyer with excellent achievements in the public service," he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly touched the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of Republicans' turnout in mid-term elections.
"Five weeks of the most important choices of our lives.
Although I am not running personally, I am actually running," he said.
"That's why I fight for excellent candidates everywhere."
Trump claims Democrats are trying to "resist and obstruct".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, said a senior Republican party official for CNN.
Hundreds lost their lives in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and numbers continue to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them picked up by huge waves that hit the beaches, when the big earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds gathered for a beach festival in Palo on Friday, when waves up to six metres (18 feet) hit the coast at dusk, bringing many to their death and destroying everything in their path.
Tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the danger of tsunami was announced yesterday, people were still engaged in their business on the beach and did not immediately escape, and they were killed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster recovery agency, in addressing Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it carried cars, logs, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800km per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Palo.
The photos from the air, published by the disaster agency, show many destroyed buildings and shops, bent and broken bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The tremors continued to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy of a massive earthquake was 200 times higher on Friday than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city at the edge of the long, narrow bay increased the strength of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were demolished.
The bodies of several victims were found under the ruins of demolished buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the Donggal area, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communications "were completely cut off without any information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the endangered areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticised for failing to report that the tsunami hit Pala, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur records distributed on social media show a man on the top floor who's warning people on the street below panicfully about the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water struck the coast, carrying buildings and cars with it.
The Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused the power loss that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for the rescue efforts of the authorities.
The military began sending cargo planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuations still need food and other basic supplies.
City airport is open again only for humanitarian flights and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled an evacuation centre visit to Palou on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami has climbed over 800.
It's very bad.
Although the staff of World Vision must have arrived from Dongala to Palo, where the employees were stationed in tents erected in the yard of the office, they witnessed scenes of destruction on the road, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began taking the first steps to alleviate the disaster, there was a complaint that foreign highly qualified humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, the influx of foreign funds, supplies and people is only possible if the site is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'okay, this is a national disaster', we will be open to international assistance, but that status has not yet been declared."
While Pal falls the second night from the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously saved and that their shocking story in this natural disaster will be mitigated.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue workers liberated a woman who had been buried under rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paragladers ahead of the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others captured at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his disciples.
"As an older member of the paragliding team, I bear my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that for hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he extended the rounds of paragladers desperately sending whatsApp messages to contestants in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages had only one grey clutch, instead of two blue clutches.
"I think that means the messages are not delivered," he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while charging an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
On Friday morning, thieves stole 26,750 dollars from a worker, Brink, who was charging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a police report in Newport.
The car driver emptied the ATM in a fun complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man came running behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the scene, said in a statement, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Everyone who has any information on their identity should contact the NYPD at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Posting a change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote, "It will be previously known under the name Kanye West."
West (41) has been known for some time under the name Ye and has used the title for its eighth album, published in June.
The change took place before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where his new album Yandhi is expected to be promoted.
He replaced singer Ariane Grande who cancelled the performance for "emotional reasons", the show's author said.
With his current professional name shorted, West had earlier said that this word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year while discussing the title of the album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It came from Kanya, which means only Ye – which reflects our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of what we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West associate, JAY-Z, also used versions with or without a dash and big letters.
AMLO in Mexico swore not to use an army against civilians
The elected President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, swore that he would never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that he would "never use his army to subdue the Mexican people".
The army fired at peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in this field, said investor and practitioners of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the US authorities issued reports of artificial intelligence, although the United States generally does not have an official strategy in the area of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: their goal is to be first in the area of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A double budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in the area of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funds could double the chance that the next great achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will happen in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Supersile artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon worked on an artificial intelligence system that proved to be superior to America's most ranked Othello player, and later he was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee paid tribute to earlier US government technology contests such as Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when they were planning the next competitions where future visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to make huge efforts to obtain government subsidies, Lee said.
"It does not deprive us of China's academic leaders, it is done by corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have, in recent years, employed brilliant individuals from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the area of artificial intelligence.
"I think you should automatically offer green cards to PhD students from the domain of artificial intelligence," he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its plan to develop the artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences grants subsidies to people in academic institutions in a similar way to that of the National Scientific Foundation and other government organisations giving money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, in the United States, the Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which seeks to include partners from industry and the academic community, and the White House announced the formation of the Electoral Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the National Science Foundation is concerned, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, US legislation that has sought to form a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of name of state
Macedonian citizens voted at Sunday's referendum to change the country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims their northern neighbour's name represents the occupation of its territory and vetoed their entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents argue this could jeopardize the ethnic identity of the Macedonian majority.
President Djordje Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised questions as to whether the referendum would go to a minimum of 50 per cent in order to make the referendum valid.
The issue on the ballot said: "Do you favour NATO membership and the EU by agreeing to an agreement with Greece."
Name changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries that broke up Yugoslavia, is worth paying for entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live freely within the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," Olivera Georgievska (79) said in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would be in charge of the result of the vote and that the result would be decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be required to change the title.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1:00 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when a total of 66 per cent of voters went to the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in the Macedonian referendum on change of name, which could pave the way for NATO membership and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and dragged chairs in front of tents that were crucified by those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join up our heads, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor but proud country.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian community."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring over-needed investment in Macedonia, with an unemployment rate higher than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will vote 'for' because it is more than 80 per cent of our population for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the ballots were inserted.
He said the result "for" would be "confirming our future".
A survey published Monday at the Macedonian Institute of Political Research said that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum – below the required exit.
According to a second poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, 57 per cent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they'd vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it takes a 50% turnout plus one vote.
The referendum's failure would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government since it came to power last May.
See: Manchester City Player Sergio Aguero passes through Brighton's entire defense and scores goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheim Sterling got rid of Brighton's defenses in 2-0 Manchester City against Brighton at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed very easy when Aguero scored goal in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received the ball in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defense players before he found himself on the open ground.
Aguera was then surrounded by three green jerseys.
He ran around a defense player and was faster than a few on the edge of the Brighton goal.
Then he added to the left, finding Sterling.
The English attacker used his first blow in the criminal space to return the ball to Aguerra, who took right-wing over the goalie Brighton Matthew Ryan with a shot to the right-hand side of the network.
"Aguero had some problems with his feet," said City coach Pep Guardiola to reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored goal at that moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave the blues the initial advantage in the Prime Minister's mutiny.
He scored goal in 29 minutes.
In that action, Aguero received the ball deep on Brighton's part of the field.
He gave Leroy Sane a wonderful addition on his left side.
Sanne touched it several times before sending Sterling to the goal.
The sky blue shooter threw the ball into the net before it slipped off the field.

Scherzer wants to play a game of no competition against Rockies
Since Nationals was eliminated in the elimination game, there was no reason to insist on another game.
But the competitive Scherzer hopes to take a stand Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have the advantage of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, are still in the game.
At least the Rockies have a direct pass for winning 5-2 against Nationals on Friday, but they're still trying to win the first championship in the league.
"Although we don't play for anything, at least we can get out on the ground knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and the other team will probably be at the highest level compared to all the other years.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those conditions?"
Nationals still need to announce the initial team for Sunday, but they're reportedly willing to let Scherzer throw in that situation.
Scherzer, who would it be the 34th time to start the game, trained on Thursday and will throw it on Sunday when he usually takes a nap.
The right-hand man from Washington runs 18:7 this season for an average of 2,53, 300 standouts in 220,2/3 innings.
Trump held a rally in West Virginia.
The president briefly referred to the situation surrounding the election of his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of the Republicans' election in half the terms of office.
"All we've done will be at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important choices of our lives.
These are one of the big, big ones – although I did not run for office, I am actually a candidate because I fight for excellent candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump went on to say, "Look at these horrible, horrible groups of radical Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power using all possible means, you see mean, dirty games.
They don't care who they hurt, who they run over to get power and control, power and control are what they want, and we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you saw it in the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "angry, mean, evil and dishonest".
He cited a democratic senator and a member of the Senate Judicial Commission, Dianne Feinstein, as a name that encouraged the audience to make a loud noise.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting -- it was a really bad language of the body -- the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
She's intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When the Momentum activists in my local party section voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised at all.
After all, I am the last in a number of Labour MPs who have been told that they are not welcome, and all because we have expressed our views.
My colleague from Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corby.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, and ironically, these are similar problems that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A notice from the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday reads "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the eight years I spent as a local laborist member of parliament, Friday night meetings were mostly like that.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not so, and the promise of a "kinder, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, and the question is whether it has ever been.
It has become increasingly evident that differing opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to party leaders.
This began not long after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I believed to share similar political views began to expect me to make 180 degrees of twists and take positions that I would never agree with, whether it be national security or the European Union's single market.
Every time I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say – it's accompanied by a lot of insults on social networks, calls for removal from the party, convictions of the centre's politics, and they tell me I shouldn't be in a labor party.
And it's not just happening to me.
On the contrary, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because my comments are mostly of political nature.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who deal with a lot of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but do not retreat.
The most disappointing thing about this political age is how these levels of insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer parties that accept different positions and any vote of distrust or change the rules of party selection is narrowed down.
I've got a lot of advice and for the last two years, they've been pushing me to bend my head, I'm less loud, and then I'm gonna be okay.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of Prime Minister Thatcher's government, which has led to my primary school classroom literally collapse, I have been trying to advocate better public services for those most in need, either as a local councillor or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my politics, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused by my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would say that when the country is heading towards Brexit, which will endanger households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand why someone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message that I have is not addressed to Momentum in Nottingham, but to voters in my constituency, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that the threats by removing me from the party or the political conspiracies will not prevent me from acting in the way that I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unrequited Ayr on top
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr has won a well-deserved victory in this exciting game of the day at the Tennent's Premier League.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only ones undefeated by ten teams.
In the end, the home team won a victory thanks to superior defense, as well as a greater number of opportunities used, and Coach Peter Murchie had reason to be pleased.
"We've been tested in games so far, and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayru, well done, they took advantage of their opportunities better than us."
The attempt by Grant Naderson in the 14th minute, which turned Frazier Clemo, gave Ayru the advantage, but the yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, whom the Warriors allowed to play, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage, and Jason Baggott caught an unconverted attempt.
Climo foamed up Ayra's lead before, just before halftime, he made a solo shot for a score of 17:5 for Ayr at halftime.
But Melrose began his second half well and tried Patrick Anderson, who turned Baggott, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a prolonged interruption due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knotto, who was brought up on the stretchers, and then Ayr further increased his advantage by trying Stafford McDowal, who turned Clemo.
Deputy Captain Ayra, Blair Macpherson, then got the yellow card, and Melrose re-used the numerical superiority with Bruce Colvin's unconverted attempt after a period of intense pressure.
However, the hosts returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card due to fouls over the climate without a ball. MacPherson reached a touch down from the penal line behind the upcoming Ayra mole.
Clemo turned, as he did almost from the beginning of the sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's blow to the penal space and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth attempt by the host.
Still game star preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still game star Ford Kieran is preparing to move to the catering industry after learning that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 50-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC series that he writes a screenplay and plays together with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last in the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although the source of the daily Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to join the "growing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no way out to sea, hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the seafront in La Paz.
On public buildings, the waves of the ocean’s flag are plentiful.
Maritime bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are lined with slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
Returning to sea is our duty."
Throughout the land of Bolivia, there is still a strong memory on the coast that they lost in the benefit of Chile in a bloody massacre around the natural resources of the nineteenth century – as well as a longing to re-enter the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the greatest in the last few decades while Bolivia expects an international court of justice to be held on October 1st after five years of council.
"Bolivia has caught the fall, in the spirit of unity and cheerfulness, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the verdict of international justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will judge in favour of Bolivia and the claim that after decades of convulsions, Chile must agree to negotiations on giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here is Morales, the charismatic president of domestic origin, who is facing a controversial re-election fight next year, also plays a big role when it comes to a verdict that will be passed on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that little will change even if it decides.
The body of the United Nations based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has led it not to decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict is delivered only six months after the final arguments have been heard suggests that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean international law expert.
And instead of making progress in the Bolivian case, the last four years may have been reprimanded.
"The problem of going out to sea has been taken by the current Bolivian authorities," Zarate said.
Morales' war rhetoric killed the rest of Chile's goodwill, she pointed out.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one point, but it will be very difficult to hold those negotiations after this.
These two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, refused the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
Monday will give Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "set a point to 139 years of dissatisfaction to mutual satisfaction," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – is using the issue of going to sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to leave the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to understand that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says disarmament will not take place until they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would not cease nuclear weapons until they trusted Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the conflicting leaders.
His comments arrived at the moment when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared at the border to resume the death of nuclear negotiations, more than three months after Singapore and a meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says it's just a dream that the continuation of sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration ending the Korean war will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not ready to agree to the declaration until Pyongyang makes significant steps in the direction of disarmament.
And Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, the government is universal skepticism when it comes to the seriousness of Pjongyang’s abandonment of the nuclear arsenal that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit of Kim and Trump.
In Paris fashion magazines presented the latest line of giant hats that you will soon see on a nearby shopping street
If you want to increase the collection of hats or completely cover the sun, you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy giant hats on the runways of their spring and summer 2019 shows everything on Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats won Instagram this summer, and these designers displayed their impressive creations on fashion runways.
The most prominent Valentine's play was the overemphasized hat with a wide feathered rim that swallowed the model's head.
Among the other glamorous accessories were the watermelons with ornamental stones, the wizard’s hat, and even the pineapple, but their purpose is not to keep your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had wet lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving gear with a breather and a mask, and the other resembled a cornnet with melted ice cream.
And if you're among those who follow the trend of attracting attention, you're lucky.
Those who follow fashion predict that giant hats can be found on nearby shopping streets.
Huge hats came after La Bomba, a straw hat with a two-foot perimeter seen on many stars, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that designed this very impractical hat that flooded social networks sent another great creation on the runway – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model that wore it.
Zagasitoranja bag of resa and white leather lunches was highlighted by the detailed Jacques La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
Stilist of the famous Luke Armitage said of FEMAIL: "I expect that large hats and beach bags will arrive at the shops on time for the next summer, since the designer left such a huge impression it would be difficult to ignore demand for pre-named fashion accessories."
John Edward: Knowledge of the language is crucial to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland can boast of extraordinary academic achievements, which continued in 2018 with a new set of outstanding results in exams, which is further reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seeks to provide the best level of service to its students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for further and more education, a career chosen and a place in the society of the world's citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own curriculum and curriculum, we can see that modern languages are still popular and desirable electoral subject of students in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language that understands it pleases him.
If you speak to him in his tongue, it pleases his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English language if we are to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
According to the results of the exams this year, we see that the languages at the top are league tables, with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received A at the final exam of high school.
The data collected from 74 SCIS members showed that 72% of students received A in the Mandarin language in the final exam in high school, while 72% of those who learned German, 69% of those who learned French and 63% of those who learned Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages, as electoral objects, are now treated in the same way as STEM objects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) and in independent school programmes, and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons employers cited for difficulties in filling jobs were precisely lacking in those who know foreign languages.
Thus, knowledge of foreign languages becomes increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more potential jobs that require knowledge of foreign languages, this skill is essential in the world of globalisation.
No matter what career someone chooses, if he knows another language, he'll have a real advantage in the future because it's a lifetime skill.
The skills of direct communication with people from foreign countries will automatically put a person who speaks more languages in front of competition.
According to YouGo survey conducted among more than 4,000 Britons in 2013, 75% could not speak another language well enough to have a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
Therefore, investing in foreign language learning is important for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, every school is different when it comes to language learning.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for Great Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests are, there will always be a few languages that he can choose from in independent schools, with an expert teaching staff in this area.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to providing an environment for learning that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, whatever awaits them in the future.
At this time, it cannot be denied that, in the global business environment, languages are crucial to the future of the country, so it must also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should certainly be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debut for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting soon ends for fans who want to see LeBron James' first show for Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play Sunday in a pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said at the official Lakers website.
Lakers' reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training early this week, James was asked about plans in six games during the upcoming Lakers.
"At this stage, my career does not require preseasonal matches to prepare myself," he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a series of election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled meetings in the next week, including visits to friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While waiting for his vote to fill the vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate because Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
When Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch him online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for seven hours tonight in Eastern time, Saturday September 29th, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia under live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about hearings this week about Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for Supreme Court, where he was tense over sexual harassment charges, and the anticipated Senate vote was postponed for seven days until the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the overriding goal of this set of gatherings is to help Republicans achieve a better result in the November elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said the assemblies this week are being held "to give energy to volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters information.
"Congress control is such a crucial part of his agenda that the president will travel as many states as possible to enter the pre-election campaign season," Reuters spokeswoman Trump's campaign refused to present himself.
Scheduled in Westbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's assembly could gather supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time this month, the country in which he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump's trying to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, who's not good at polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to raise his poll ratings," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters report.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows fighting to keep hope before individual matches Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the four on Saturday afternoon might be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
A clunky swing is a completely fabricated concept in sport, but one of those that players truly believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Who do they think has momentum right now?
"They ran six points, and now four, so it can be said that the swing is on our side," said Jordan Spieth on his way out.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, four points higher, with twelve more in play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, still believe they have some wind in their wings, and there's a lot that gives them encouragement, including the form of Spith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each took three points out of the possible four.
Spieth was brilliant from the first to the last punch and led by his example.
The shouts of celebration grew louder during his round, to ultimately play a key blow for the unsolved score in the fourth match when he and Thomas were behind two after two.
His final blow to the 15 holes match was greeted by a similar shout, one that reflects the belief that there is hope for the American team.
"You just have to do your best and take care of your match," said Spith.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with more points than Spith and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of Ryder Cup.
An unusual but irresistible European couple won all four matches and played without a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't play God's punch on Saturday afternoon, and they dodged them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The game they have shown so far also the way they share energy with the noisy audience has strengthened them in the position of the main favorites on Sunday, and there are no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinari who could take a potential European victory while the sun sets over Le Golf National.
It would be best for both of us at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still early to talk about European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergi Garcia, the hero of the game with four balls that morning, when he played with Alex Noreen.
One God's blow and two in the first nine holes buried a Spaniard and a Swede in a hole they couldn't even spring from.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of your hole.
The game with four balls and four balls is so fascinating to look closely for interaction between couples, advice given and not given, and how strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a great advantage over the final day, but this session four showed that the U.S. team has a wish for a fight that some have suspected, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the last Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, since after Saturday's four-ball matches and four-balls won the 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, first led with two victories over the indisposed Tiger Woods, increasing the result so far in the Le Golf National field to four points.
Europeans Thomas Bjorn in the fight to recover the trophy they lost at the Hazeltine golf club two years ago, dominated the imprecise Americans in the morning game with four balls and won the 3-1 series.
The United States has given more resistance to the four-way tournament, winning two matches, but could not reduce the backlog.
Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points in 12 individual matches Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutante to win four points in a row, while he and the Molinars, named "Milliwood" after a fantastic weekend, are only the second pair in the history of Ryder Cup, who won four points in the first four matches.
After they ran over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they made a great match and overcame the tired Woods and American debutante Bryson Dechambeau with even more convincing 5:4.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, was flashing at times, but now lost 19 of the 29 swords in a game of four balls and fours and seven in a row.
Juston Rose, who was resting during the morning game with four balls, returned to Henry Stanson's partner in tournament four and suffered a defeat of 2:1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coepka – the first and third in the world.
Yet Europe did not go according to the plan of this pleasant bright day south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, a three-time champion, set the goal for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They fought the 2-1 victory against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game, so that they would later return and beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy 4:3 in fours, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup has some team returned after four points behind the individual match, although Fury's side that defends the title is enough unsolved result to keep the trophy.
However, after two days in second place, they do not appear to be able to carry out an attack on Sunday.
North Korea suggests "no speech" on unilateral disarmament unless there is trust
North Korean Foreign Minister said Saturday to the United Nations that extending sanctions deepens its mistrust in the United States and that in such circumstances the country will by no means unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Hu said at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken “significant measures to show good will” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear range, and promises not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, there is no adequate response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there will be no mention of the first unilateral disarmament."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's famous complaints of resistance to Washington's "still" approach to denuclearisation by which North Korea would be rewarded for progressive steps, the significance of his statement was that he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation from the game as Pjongjang had previously done.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit held between the current US President and North Korean leader on June 12th in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on "denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with security assurances.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also disobeyed calls to mitigate international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States does not give up 'denuclearisation above all' and increase the pressure on sanctions to achieve its goal by force, even opposed to 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The thought that sanctions can put us on our knees is letting the dreams of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that extended sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri didn't mention plans for another summit between Kim and Trump that the American leader was talking about in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added, "If we were to negotiate this denuclearisation problem with South Korea and not the United States, denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not have come into such an unexposed position."
Yet, Rio's tone of speech differed dramatically from last year, when he said at the UN General Assembly that the firing of US land by North Korea rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "a rocketman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations Trump, which threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said there was much more to be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea conducted denuclearisation.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set up a time frame for this, saying, "If necessary, let it last for two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council sanctions must continue to be strictly and without accommodating them until complete, final, confirmed denuclearisation."
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea, which have been applied since 2006, in an effort to prevent financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompé met with Rio outside the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompé has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
In July he left Pjongjang saying that progress had been made, and North Korea condemned him only a few hours later for making "gangster demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has pledged to dismantle the missile range as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes "measures".
He said that Kim told him that "appropriate measures" require the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to force more sleep students in an effort to eradicate the more popular macho culture of learning "over all night with caffeine".
One academic observed that students from the leading university in the world are often ignorant of their basic concern for themselves.
Charles Cheisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical College and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, created a course he believes to be the only one in the United States.
The inspiration to launch this course was given after a speech that held about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this just now, in my senior year?'
She said no one has ever told her how important the dream is – which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This year's course for the first time presents the basis for students about how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sporting results, as well as improving their general state.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical College and the executive director of the University Health Service, said the university decided to introduce a course after it was noted that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, the picture of the room in the student home and the students should click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on athletic performances and the importance of routine before bedtime.
In the second part, participants were told that a prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a map of campuses with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know what health effects you have to decide to smoke cigarettes," said Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride over the "dwelling of the night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led the lack of sleep to become an increasing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and quality, should be the "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against the extra kilograms, since the lack of sleep makes the brain become a starving regime, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Cheisler come up with a course after attending one of his lectures in his first year at Harvard.
He says that this course opened his eyes and inspired him to advocate his maintenance on the entire campus.
It is hoped that the next step is to ask all diplomats to pass a similar study programme before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students think about setting the alarm in time for sleep and waking and that it take care of the harmful effects of "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lighting and can disrupt the circadian rhythm, and thus lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Mengin goal beat Gerrard team
The Rangers suffered another depressive defeat in the guests when Dolly Menga shot and sent Steven Gerrard's split team to 1-0 from Livingstone.
The team from Ibrox wanted to take the first victory in the guests after the February triumph of 4:1 in St John'ston, but the team of Gary Holt forced Gerrard as the manager of only the second defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the unattainable leaders of the Ladbrokes League Prime Minister Hearts.
Menga was shot seven minutes before half the time, and the uninspired ranger set never came close to evening.
While the Rangers now fell to the sixth place, Livingston climbed to the third and behind the Hibernian only because of the goal difference.
The Rangers could face additional problems after a line judge named Calum Spence had to show some help when he was being shot in the side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtaked Ayr and took part in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
On the other hand, Holt was committed to the same eleven Livingstone players who took point Hearts last week and would be delighted by the way his well-trained team pressed opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated the property of the ball, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
Little was missing to score a goal just two minutes after Menga first added to the empty space sent Scott Pittman to the Allan McGregor goal, but a midfield player missed a big shot and shot beside the goal.
Deep free shot by Keaghan Jacobs was then found by Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense, Alan Lithgow, was only able to kick beside the goal, near the statue.
The Rangers were able to take control, but their game in the last third gave out more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have received a 15-minute penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
The Rangers only scored two shots at the goal in the first half, but former goalie Ibroxa, Liam Kelly, defended the hit with Lassane Coulibaly's head and tamed the shot that Ovie Ayari had directed.
Although the first Livingstone goal in 34 minutes may not have reflected the right attitude of the forces during the game, no one can argue that it was deserved, if for no other reason, then for the effort made.
The Rangers again couldn't cope with Jacobs' deep free blow.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who stayed calm and chose Menga as a simple ending.
Gerrard reacted to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly, and that replacement almost immediately gave the result when the wing player hired Morelos, but impressive Kelly came running from his line and blocked it.
Livingstone, however, continued to instruct guests to play just as they fit, with long scores of Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team had a chance to increase the leverage in the last few minutes, but McGregor held on well and defended Jacobs' attack, so that Lithgow would send a ball from the corner to the goal.
The replacement Rangers player, Glenn Middleton, was looking for another penalty at the end of the game when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't react again.
Almanah: The Inventor of Geiger's Count · Global Voices
And now, the station from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that will eventually become a device known as the Geiger counter.
In addition to being one of the main pillars of science, Geiger's counter has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 Bell of Coronado, in which the seemingly amazing cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put those headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms with your ears, thanks to the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Yeah, it's a crack!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells and then kill them.
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of therapy
The procedure involves removing immunological cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory
They can thus "see" a protein that is common in many types of cancers and then re-inject
The test vaccine showed promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves removing immunological cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" HER2 protein, and re-injecting them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Institute for Malignancy in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "helps the growth of several types of cancer" including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immunological cells from patients and teaching them how to target malignant cells was effective in treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West gave a strong speech of support to Trump, wearing the MAGA hat, after his performance on SNL.
He didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was scouted during the Saturday Night Live show after a lush performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song called Ghost Town, that night he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great", he insulted the Democrats and spoke again about his support for Trump.
"So many times I've talked to white people who say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?
If I cared about racism, I would have moved away from America long ago," he said.
SNL started a sketch show featuring Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Commission regarding claims of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the video of West's speech was shared by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It's not clear that Rock tried to make fun of West by posting the video.
West also complained to the audience that he was having a hard time behind the hat.
"They teased me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head."
They were teasing me!
And then they tell me I collapsed," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see what it looks like?" adding that "will put on Superman's cloak because it means you can't boss me around.
Try love."
His comments provoked the audience's whistling at least twice, and SNL's team members were visibly embarrassed, Variety said, while one person who was present said, "The entire studio has been completely silent."
West was brought in as a replacement for Ariane Grande, whose ex-partner, Mac Miller rapper, died a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of the song I love it disguised as a bottle of Perrier.
Westa supported the leader of the conservative TPUS group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls: Thank you for not stepping back in front of the villains."
But the show host Karen Hunt tweeted that West simply "was what he truly was and that it was absolutely beautiful".
"But I choose not to reward anyone (so I will buy his music or clothes or support his 'art') for whom I believe he has embraced and spread an ideology that harms my society.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper posted on Twitter that he changed his name, saying it is now "will be previously known by the name Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Comrade rapper Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion, and of course the late musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to "the artist previously known as Prince".

"The Games of the Throne" star Kit Harrington condemned toxic macho culture
Kit Harrington is known for his role as Jon Snow, who beats the sword in a violent medieval fantasy, the HBO Series The Game of the Throne.
However, the actor (31) stumbled on the stereotype of macho heroes, saying that such roles on the screen mean that boys very often feel that they should be rough to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the toxic macho culture problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married a partner in the Leslie Rose throne game (31), admitted that he had a "strong need" to deal with this problem.
"I am currently quite troubled by the question – what did we do wrong with presenting manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they're growing up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the spread of toxic macho culture due to the portrayal of men.
He went on to say, "What is innate, and what is the matter of upbringing?
What is it that teaches us on TV and in the streets that young people think they have to fit into a certain pattern of man's behavior?
I think that's actually one of the main questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong for young people."
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not agree to the prepositions or sequels of the Series of the Games of the Throne after its end next summer, saying he "completed with battlefields and horses".
As of November, the whale will be playing in the show by Sam Shepard True West, talking about the movie producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened in the Game of Thrones series.
"I met my wife in this series, so it can be said that she gave me a future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, Keith's love partner Jon Snow in this fantastic show that won the Emmy Award.
Couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's parents in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of new cases of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been hit, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, which is a change over the previous situation.
Usually in the past, HIV spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions infected with the virus.
However, the number of people who receive HIV this way is reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a worsening problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been considered illegal in China since 1997, but they say LGBT discrimination is very widespread.
Studies estimate that because of conservative perceptions in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
The transmission of the virus is often also due to inadequate sexual protection in such relations.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of a plan to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff published information about Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
American MP Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff published the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's website.
A Democratic MP from Los Angeles claims that these claims are made by experts and the website of the "ultradesnic wing".
"Lying, lying and even more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, and was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual harassment against candidates for Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
There was an announcement at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publication was linked to Waters' office and published information about a member of its staff, Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is a completely incorrect and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and incorrect allegations – is in no way responsible for disclosing this information.
This baseless claim is a completely false and absolute lie."
Watersov's statement soon sparked a judgment on the Internet, which was issued by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial exudes rage," Fleischer wrote.
"This leads to the conclusion that she does not have the temperament needed for a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he mustn't be angry.
He can't be impertinent.
He must not question the defendant's motives.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer clearly compared Waters' reaction to the criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh's democrats, who critics accused of acting too furious at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was running to replace Waters in mid-term elections, also volunteered on Twitter.
"The big thing if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office warned "the relevant competent institutions and judicial authorities about these false allegations".
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they are accountable before the law for all their actions which are unstable and dangerous for all members of my staff."
Johnny English movie review again in action – a sleazy spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already turned into a tradition to look for subtext about Brexit in every new film with British theme, which can also apply to this continuation of the franchise of satirical action comedies about Johnny English – which began in 2003 with the realization of "Johnny English" and returned to screens in 2011 with the sequel "Johnny English: reborn".
Will the ironic autosatira about how obviously useless we will be a new export opportunity for the nation?
Either way, a grumpy, incompetent Johnny English rubber face has been given a new opportunity to screw up something – with his name more than anything indicating that it is a general comical creation designed for territory with a cinema audience whose English is not a native language.
It is, of course, a silly secret agent who, despite the bizarre pretensions of the highest glamour, carries a little Clouseau, a little Mister Bean, and a little bit of that guy who played only one note in the theme tune of the "Chariots of Fire" ceremony opening the 2012 London Olympic Games.
It is also originally based on a traveler and an international man who was told the veil of secrecy that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
One or two scenes of the latest her venture are good.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval knight armor and when the rotor knives briefly rattled on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems weak and in a very strange way superfluous, especially now that "serious" film brands like 007 and the Impossible Mission are confidently adding comic elements.
The impression is that it is a humor for children, not for adults, and for me the crazy adventures of Johnny English are not inventive and worked out as Atkinson's goghs in the style of silent films in Mr. Bean's image.
Now the topic is very topical that Britain is in serious trouble.
The hacker infiltrated the British super-secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, the horror of an agent on duty -- unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop in a full glass of water for the prime minister, a pompous and depressed character who is already experiencing a complete collapse due to a fall of political popularity: Emma Thomson maestrally played this character modeled on Theresa May, but the script is quite scarce.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies have been compromised and will have to hire one of the retired.
And that means the shabby Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some fancy institution, but informally holds lessons on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gags when English holds the Academy of Espionage in the Manner of "The School of the Year".
The English are quickly returning to Whitehall for emergency instructions and to reassemble it with former disproportionately patient partner Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander in whose energetic and noisy role Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are once again at the service of Her Majesty's secret service and happiness the beautiful fatal wife of Ophelia Bullet, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the vicious Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough are starting their odyssey of comical events: disguised as waiters, they set fire to an elegant French restaurant, real chaos-kreshing on Voltina's luxury yacht, and English is launching a real anarchy by trying to get familiar with the interior of Voltina's house using headphones for virtual reality.
It's obvious that great effort has been put into that last sequence, but no matter how cute and cheerful, the whole movie seems to be made for children.
Pretty mediocre quality.
As with other movies about Johnny English, I can't help but wonder: can the British film industry come up with a role for Rowan Atkinson that would really show his talent?
The Labour Party denies making a plan for the British to work by four days a week, and they'll be paid in five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will consider a radical plan for the British to work on for four days a week, but be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to move workers' time that they save thanks to the AI revolution by giving them another day off.
Employees would thus enjoy a three-day weekend – but would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "join" the party's economic agenda and plans to improve workers' working conditions and rights.
The move to a four-day work week was approved by the Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
A high source from the Labour Party said of the Sunday Times: "A new policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits into the party's approach to the recovery of the economy in favour of workers, as well as a party's industrial strategy at all."
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the pre-election campaign in 2017.
However, this ambition does not have the support of the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokesman said, "The four-day working week is not party politics and the party is not considering it."
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to expose his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the hands of "blameless directors" and "professors" in utilities.
The opposition's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the shares in the water supply companies may not recover their entire investments because the laborists could impose "returns" on the basis of perceived injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and to create inclusive ownership funds that would allocate 10% of the company's private sector value to employees who are likely to collect annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy are talking about a 60-minute show about whether the FBI investigation could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question whether an investigation of the bureau could lead some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, air correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think so, of course," said Kennedy.
"Before the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was unwavering, determined, unequivocal."
But Senator Graham's voice seems to have been sealed.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh has been formed and it would require a strong accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it vigorously," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she calls can't confirm that.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Festival of Citizens of the World, and has he done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Citizens of the World, an annual musical event with a truly impressive list of stars to perform, and an equally impressive goal – to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Festival of Citizens of the World will gather tens of thousands of people on the great Central Park lawn who will not only enjoy performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true purpose of this event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of the global project against poverty, an international group that advocates the elimination of poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight the same.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay for the VIP card), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a number of tasks or "acts", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the world leader, a phone call and any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal – ending poverty.
But how successful is the citizen of the world project with only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to do something, or just another kind of so-called "clictivism" – when people believe they have done something that will change the world by signing petitions online or tweeting?
Since 2011, from the Citizens of the World initiative, they have registered more than 19 million "actions" of their supporters who have advocated a number of different goals.
They say that these actions have led world leaders to announce promises and policies worth more than 37 billion dollars and will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 promises and announcements resulting from their actions, and at least 10 billion dollars have already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected have already directly affected 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key promises are the power of nutrition, the partnership of investors and realtors from Great Britain who have promised to "help children to grow into their full potential", vowing that Rwanda will allocate $35 million to fit the end of nourishment in that country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the citizens of the world.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition become a historical footnote," said Ambassador Powers Food, Tracey Ulman, a live concerter in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions that called on Britain to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government announced it would fund a project called Power of Nutrition, whose interventions would affect the lives of 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, which reads, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
A citizen of the world answers, "It will be a long and difficult journey, and sometimes we will fall and fall.
However, like all major movements for civil rights and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will perform at this year's New York event, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could "block" Russia in energy exports – the secretary of the interior
Washington can "if necessary" use its navy to prevent exports of Russian energy to third markets, including the Middle East, revealed Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of the Interior, and transferred Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russian engagement in Syria – namely, they are there at the invitation of a legitimate government – is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe and the centre of southern Europe," he said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to address this issue.
"The United States has the possibility that, together with our navy, it will ensure that sea corridors remain open or block them, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not go to market," he said.
Zinke was addressing those present at an event whose organiser was the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "vote of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, stating it was the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia consists more or less in the use and replacement of fuel," he said, saying Russia has only one asset, and that its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements come after Trump's administration's mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia as a far more favourable option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, would make Berlin a "conspirator" of Moscow.
On several occasions, Moscow stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth $11 billion and that the existing pipeline capacity should be doubled to 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively a business project.
The Kremlin claims that the reasons for Washington's fierce opposition to this project are purely economic in nature and that this is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should have the choice of suppliers," Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who was held in Moscow in September.
The state of the United States has provoked a reaction from Germany that has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Union of the German Industry (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Union (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously reconsider" the presidential candidacy for 2020, said state senator Masachusets
State Senator Masachusetts Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "think seriously" about running for president after the next mid-term elections.
During a meeting at a town hall in the town of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the candidacy.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, which includes a woman at the top," she said, and broadcasts the source The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren called President Donald Trump during a meeting at City Hall, saying he "guided this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was named for criticism of Trump and his candidate for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the polls published on Thursday showed that most of the electoral bodies voted for Warren do not think that it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of voters who will "probably" vote in the state of Massachusetts said that the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk/list Centre for Political Research at the University of Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed that there was greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent of voters supporting a potential bid and 48 per cent against the candidacy.
The other sound names in the order of the Democrats discussed in terms of their potential candidacy in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin was talking about PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump's support rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruitment in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence following Monday night's incident.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after his return, I can connect with what's going on with other families suffering the effects of PTSD and the vulnerability with which our soldiers are returning," said the audience at a rally of support to President Donald Trump in the town of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "hot topic" and, speaking of her son and other war veterans, added "they return a little differently, they return stronger, they return, asking whether there is respect for what their comrades soldiers and pilots and all other members of the army have given to this country."
He was arrested Monday in the town of Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence -- assaulting a woman, obstructing family violence and possession of weapons under the influence of opiates, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Administration.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support the review of a new US policy that suppresses asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District submitted a friendly report to the court in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers challenging this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against the Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal police has not been revealed.
She said she was abused by her partner "and violent members of his gang," but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace explained that the countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States are coming, are facing a growing problem related to gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annulled the 2014 Immigration Complaints Committee's decision to allow non-documented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Public Prosecutor District Columbia, General Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "depreciates decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires that all asylum requirements be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the application, and that the chamber thus violates that principle," the friendly report states.
Lawyers further argue in the report that the police that prevents immigrants from entering harm the economy of the United States, and that they will likely become entrepreneurs and "safeguard the necessary labour".
State Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered judges in cases involving migrants in June not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azil is only available to those who leave their home countries for persecution or fear of belonging to a particular race, religion, nationality or certain social group or because of their political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on 11 June about politics.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in the city of Palo as the death toll doubles in search of survivors
The survival situation is getting worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusum, comforting her sick little boy at the evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palo.
‘Emergency assistance shall be imported by the authorities at any moment.
The government has a shortage of clean water."
Residents return to their broken homes, trekking through flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals devastated by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees are overrun.
Some of the injured like Dwi Harris who have broken their backs and shoulders have been placed outside the Palou Military Hospital, where patients are provided with assistance outside for continuous severe shocks.
His eyes are filled with tears as he relates how he felt the powerful earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pushed by the ruins of the wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of committing "violence with propaganda ads"
Seven days after the official Chinese newspaper published an ad on four pages in the U.S. newspaper, giving thanks for the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to China Daily's paid supplement to Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering with the November 6th U.S. Congress elections, which China is denying.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections indicates that US officials have told Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
And while it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements aimed at promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war where they increase each other's import tariffs.
As an countermeasure, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war were directed at exporters in states such as Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and the earlier longtime mayor of Iowa, who is the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment published in the Sunday newspaper Des Moines Register, "now doubles this violence by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"In expanding its propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting the valuable American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, a paid ad in the newspaper Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the kiosk which is down here in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any true reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have on China's problematic business path, bearing in mind that the Chinese media are under the firm rod of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not state what the newspaper is about.
Republicans discourage women from voting ahead of mid-term elections with Kavanaugh's debacle, analysts warn
Analysts have warned that a large number of prominent Republicans who defend and stand by a candidate for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who face several charges of alleged sexual assault, will experience negative reactions, especially women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions associated with this issue are very intense and most Republicans already show that they want to give their vote.
There is no going back in these things," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, in an article for a magazine published Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected that the last minute Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) requested an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," Karina Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and state spokeswoman of the progressive group MoveOn, said in Washington newspaper D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators shouted "November is coming!" during demonstrations in the Senate Hall, while Republicans in charge of the Justice Committee decided to persist with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be enormous," St Rotenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news.
"People say he's already tall, which is true.
But it could be higher, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and in younger voters between 18 and 29 years, who, although not in favour of the president, do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she brought forth details of the alleged sexual assault charges against the Supreme Court's referee, analysts were of the opinion that there might be negative reactions if Republicans persisted with the appointment.
"This has become a big mess for the Great Old Party," Michael Steele, former head of the Republican National Committee, told the NBC News network earlier this week.
"It is not just the vote of the Committee or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it is also about the way Republicans have dealt with the issue and how they have dealt with it," he said for the information channel Guy Cecil, director of the US Group of Priorities, which supports the election of Democrats.
Yet, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slight lean toward Kavanaugh.
The new YouGov poll shows that 41% of the subjects definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35% say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30% said they felt the same way about Ford.
After Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least another person who has brought charges, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Justice Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh had attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez allegedly claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court judge showed her his genitals while attending parties during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web network plans to launch a new Internet that will surpass Google and Facebook
The Berners-Lee team, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup designed to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid, whose creator is Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and what people have access to what information.
In an exclusive invasion of Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intention was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said talking about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal data store on the network" or the PO (personal online store data).
It can contain a list of contacts, list of obligations, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique to the personal data store on the network is that it is entirely up to the users who can access which types of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the firm's CEO, John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM security platform, a number of employees of development engineers hired to work on the project and the volunteer community.
Since this week, technology engineers around the world have been able to create their decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models will all be completely destroyed overnight.
"We're not asking their permission."
In a statement Saturday on the Medium platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission to secure commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of a new site built on Solida".
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although it launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Foundation for the Web and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of Victoria’s cross assigned to the priest in World War I
Celebrating the only priest of the Church of England who was decorated with Victoria 's cross as a fighter in World War I was awarded 100 years later in his hometown .
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won recognition on 29 September 1918 for an attack against the cities of Bellenglise and Lehoucourt.
A few days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had won the greatest British military confession.
On Saturday's parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandkids discovered a plaque.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “unbelievably symbolic ” that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after the feat for which his grandfather received the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very dense fog and under heavy gunfire from the battlefield and machine gunfire."
Later, he rushed to the fire line and with the "greatest hero" led the platoon forward before, without any help, he rushed onto the Polish cannon and cut down three of the military squad..
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna killed a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s moves were “something I know I could never reach, but something that caused humility. ”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after a parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero shows the support that many will give."

Imagine that, you stayed up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 swords to eventually prevent you from watching the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main list and appeared live during the night on Channel 5 in Britain.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face up, viewers in Britain remained amazed when the transmission interrupted Pepe Pigs.
Many were not impressed that they stayed up all night until the early hours of the morning precisely because of the struggle.
A Twitter fan described this interruption as "a kind of sick joke."
"It is about the government regulation, which states that at 6 a.m. this content is inappropriate, and they had to replace it with a programme for children," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President of Bellator for Marketing and Communications, to ask about the transfer.
""Pepa Pig," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said he would work on his schedule to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think when I talk about reprising, I think we can probably work it out," said Coker.
"But the transmission is there at 6 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to realize anything until Sunday comes, when Monday will be with them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a breakup, there were correspondences and they were all hostile.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't like that, it was a matter of government jurisdiction.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We'll reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've gone too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" over sexuality
The Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
A 24-year-old said that only in high school did he realize that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, representing Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke openly about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular director of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, was away for several months because of the disease.
Appearing as an outlaw on Laverne's first show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "less valuable" than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and the feeling that I was different were the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so people are not disappointed when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
The double champion of bronze Olympic medals has become a very important fighter for the LGBT population and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy that he had the opportunity to speak publicly without consequences and that he wanted to give others “hope. ”
A triple world champion said that falling in love with a man, American producer Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 "surprised him."
Daley married an Oscar winner last year, who was 20 years older than him, and said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you live so much while you are so young" - the first time he appeared in the Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - said it was hard to find someone the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple made themselves the parent of the boy Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "total perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was only about "I have to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they still had tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be here to sit in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand while he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead did I finally realize he was not invincible," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I just knew that what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a local audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It served as an inspiration for his selection of the first song - the stream of Heather Small - that was echoing in it while preparing for the Olympics and from which he was still passing through the bushes.
Desert Island Discs is on Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. in British summer time.
Mickelson out form on bench at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he'll be playing his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he'll have to regain form so this won't be a joyous turning point.
Mickelson, who plays the biennale for the record 12th time, Captain Jim Furyk sent to the bench in Saturday games with four balls and four games.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the five-time winner spent a day cheering and improving the range in the game, hoping to correct what bothers him.
This 48-year-old, who has never been the best player, even at the height of his career, is not an ideal choice for demanding terrain Le Golf Nationala, where the long uneven terrain regularly punishes stray blows.
And if the ground itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson faces the British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who won all four of his matches this week with a rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, which 12 individual matches start with four points less, reach a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man, but he couldn't even say anything more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the shoulder and hugged me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He strongly believes in himself.
He is a member of the House of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined there'd be more, but that's how it went, and we thought it had to go that way.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Falda's record Sunday by number of Ryder Cup matches.
This could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup where he never fully achieved the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven half-times, even though Furyk said his presence brought a certain intangible value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, likes to joke with people and it's great to have such a guy on the team," he explained.
"I think it was fun for the younger players to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a puck game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, from experience knows that a significant advantage in the last day of individual matches Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The day appeared for the first time at a game played in Valderram in 1997, when the party whose captain was Seven Ballesteros had the advantage of five points over the Americans, but they finished the competition with a narrow difference of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You are constantly reminded that we had a great advantage in Valderram, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we won," Bjorn, conceived after watching the team 2018, which won the 5-3 score on Friday and led 10-6 in Le Golf National yesterday.
So history and everyone on that team will show me this isn't over.
You're going to finish up tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, which is to try to win this trophy and that remains the focus.
All the time I'm talking, I'm focused on 12 players on our side, but we are very well aware of what is across-the-way on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Delighted at the performance of his players at a heavy golf tournament, Bjorn added: "I would never let this take me.
Tomorrow's a new day.
Tomorrow's individual games are in order, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with your partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you test yourself as a golfer.
That's the message you have to convey to the players - give the most of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner, and he also has to do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Furyk will ask his players to play better individually than they did in couples, excluding Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Suryk himself was at both ends of those major twists on the last day, since he was part of a Brooklyn winning team before he ended up a loser after Europe performed a "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he replied when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, encouraged his players the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very start like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When it starts with that kind of rush, it creates a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We've formed our lineup accordingly, and we've prepared the boys so we can try to do some magic tomorrow, you know."
Thomas was assigned to try to counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans in the upper half.
"I went with this group of guys to this setup because I think it can cover up until the end," Bjorn said about choosing players for singles.
New German warship waiting again
The new frigate of the German Navy was to be launched in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War, but will not arrive for at least another year due to system failures and emergency costs, local media reported.
The launch of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", a leading ship in the class of the brand-new Baden-Wuertemberg frigate, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, quoted by military spokesmen.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems following delivery threatened the fate of this ambitious project.
Four Navy ships from Baden-Wuertemberg class ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
As far as we know, it will have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to schedule the latest frigates up to two years without returning to the port of origin.
However, constant delays mean that the most modern warships, which were to allow Germany to deploy forces outside its territory, would already be obsolete at the time they began to be used, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate frigate F125 arrived in the paper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of key "soft and hardware flaws" that would make the ship useless if it were deployed to a combat mission.
Software failures were of particular importance because Baden-Wuertemberg class ships will manage crews of some 120 sailors - exactly half of the number of people who operated the old Bremen class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is significantly too heavy to reduce its impact and limit the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that 7,000 tons of heavy ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of a complete project, including training staff, is also becoming problematic.
It is said to have reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), compared to the initial 2.2 billion.
The problems related to the latest frigates are particularly significant in the light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Parliamentary Defence Commission, admitted that the Navy is in fact "missing ships that can be deployed".
The official said that this problem has grown over time because the old ships have been disbursed and no replacement ships have been acquired.
He complained that none of the frigates in Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund Listens to the Secret Life of the Bat
A new study carried out on a property in Scotland's hills aims to discover how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide in future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland will follow ordinary bats and species of soprano, as well as a brown long bat and bat species Daubenton in the Gardens of Inverew Gardens in Wester Ross.
The special recording device will be set at key locations around the estate to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of all records will determine the frequency of calls from bats and what they do.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant in NTS, hopes to show what habitats are the most important bats and how each species uses them.
This data will help to establish the use of work on habitat management, such as the creation of meadows, and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and the UK declined significantly during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which negatively affects the beds and loss of habitats.
Windmills and lighting can also pose risks, including sticky paper and chemical treatment of construction materials, and attacks by cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when they catch prey.
They're using a sophisticated echo-location technique to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 ha of countries throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly perform checks, inspections of beds, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even founded the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the Three estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says the property is ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threeve we have a large bat area," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of ancient trees and all good habitats.
But there is still so much unknown about bats, so what we do here and on other properties will help us to understand better what they need to progress."
He stresses how important it is to check that the bats are on the property, as it is possible to accidentally kill up to 400 females and young women, which will likely lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and the law prohibits killing, harassing, harassing or destroying their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official of the Scottish Bat Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to turn on and help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how most of our species develop. ”
Ronaldo dismisses rape charges while lawyers file a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo is charged with rape which he was referred to as "false news," saying people "wanted to promote" using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which issued the charges.
Portugal and Juventus' attacker is accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, after that, he paid her $37,000 to stop this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking to his companions, 142 million in the Instagram Live video, hours after the indictment report, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the reports by calling them "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said a five-time goldball conqueror in camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain fame by talking about me, but it's part of the job.
I am a lucky man and everything is fine," the player added smiling.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to press charges against Der Spiegel for these allegations, which they called "unauthorised reporting of privacy concerns," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "non-material damage in amounts that correspond to the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorg reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents delivered to Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told her he was a "99% good guy" who failed those "1%."
According to the papers, Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had sexual relations, but that he volunteered.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that the hospital photographed her injuries, but that she later agreed to a non-judicial settlement because she felt "fear of retaliation" and worried that she would "be publicly humiliated".
A 34-year-old says she's now seeking a annulment because she's still traumatized by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian wilderness Juve by 100m euros.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing car manufacturers
The UK will "always regret" if it loses the status of world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that "disturbing" is what Toyota UK said about the BBC - if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement that it will temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Mr Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the borders in case Bexit was left without an agreement could result in job losses.
A plant from Burnston that manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March we will see a halt to production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other UK producers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, voiced fear about how cross-border trade will work if Britain leaves the EU without agreement.
BMW, for example, says they'll close their mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks in the supply chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota Production Line operates on the principle of "just in time", where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for cars made by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there may be a break at the border which could lead to delays and partial shortages for industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies for longer than one day at his Derbyshire factory, they said from the company, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said the "Chequers" plan offering Theresa May for future relations with the EU "is precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We have to have an agreement. We want to achieve the best agreement that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy our current success, but also to seize this opportunity," Radio 4 said in today's BBC programme.
"The example not only of Toyota but of other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely capable of continuing what was an extremely successful series of supply chains."
Toyota could not tell how long production would be suspended, but warned that in the long term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory on the market and eventually reduce jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and was president of the Unite Union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, when jobs like this close, they never come back.
The government spokesman said: "We have to make a precise and convincing plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, say from the White House
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" as the fight continues regarding the candidate for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates a case of Russian involvement in the elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy general prosecutor or not, and thus endanger Mr. Mueller's independence, it's been a topic of speaking in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had also discussed the sound system in order to record talks with Trump and the possibility of changing the president on the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein threw away these rumors.
But last Monday, he was in the White House in the middle of a rumor that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, then held in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would not like to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, witnessed.
Trump ordered Friday that the FBI conduct an investigation into Kavanaugh's charges for a week, further delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for this is still not fixed, it could be this week, and it could be postponed for another week, taking into account all the other things that are happening in connection with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like the press always to be informed."
Some journalists would refute this claim: Sandersov has not held a brief address for journalists in the White House since 10 September.
Chief Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the smaller number of short talks did not result from aversion to "theatral behavior" of TV journalists, although she said, "I will agree with the fact that they exaggerate."
Then she said she would strengthen direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she said without citing evidence: "We have seen these numbers."
The brief talks will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to directly question the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do this as much as possible and you've seen us do it for the past few weeks, and these talks with the President of the United States will replace short-talking to journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences when officials visit.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York City this week, the president may have shown why, acting unrestrainedly and occasionally strangely in front of the assembled journalists.
Health Secretary writes to EU staff in the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland about the fears of Brexit
The health secretary wrote to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express the state's gratitude and the desire to remain after Brexit.
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeanne Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already committed itself to offset the costs of the resolved status requirements for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "The withdrawal negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued over the summer, and decisions are expected this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this has been a very troubled time for all of you.
For this reason, I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and more broadly, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
The defensive player of the State Tigers Tennessee team, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he injured his head in Saturday's 31:27 Vanderbilt Commodores club, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"It reached the line of the terrain and simply collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field before they put it on the stretcher and carried it out for further testing.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris on the WSMV Nashville channel Tennessee that Abercrombie had completed the operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details of the type/mass of injury yet" and that Tennessee State is trying to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student in red jersey, plays first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
He had five total knocks on Saturday before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 shootouts in the season.
Customers will be charged higher taxes on real estate purchases in the UK
Customers from foreign countries will be charged higher fees during the purchase of real estate in the UK, with additional funds being used to help homeless people according to new conservation plans
This move will neutralize Corby's efforts to attract young voters
Larger fees will be charged to non-tax payers in the UK
The vault expects to raise up to 120 million pounds per year - to help the homeless
Foreign customers will be charged higher taxes on buying real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
This step will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success achieved by Jeremy Corbyn by trying to attract young voters to promises that it will ensure more affordable housing and focus on those who earn more.
The higher charges will be charged to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional money strengthening the government's intention to fight open sleep.
The additional fee, which is next to the existing fee, including more levels, introduced two years ago to another property and purchase for rent, could be as much as 3%.
The vault expects this move to increase revenue to 120m pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are being purchased by people who do not have a residence in the UK, which is why prices are rising, and customers who first buy real estate are becoming more difficult to become homeowners.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "spirit cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a taxi reduction to help a greater number of young people reach their first home.
He accused construction companies of holding high real estate prices by buying the first land they don't use, and asked Mrs May to drop quotas for affordable houses as soon as possible in order to end the British's' "bargain of housing policy".
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including control of renting and suspension of nothing-induced deposits.
He also wants to give councils greater authority to build new houses.
Ms. May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my term to the prime minister to return the British dream — that the life of every new generation should be better.
And that means fixing our poor housing market.
Britain will always remain open to people who want to live, work, and build life in it.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy houses easily as valuable British people.
The dream of owning the house has become too far for many people, and the human sleep in the open is still very real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland's chief, Jack Ross, says his "endless ambition" is to be the manager of the Scottish team at a certain point.
Forty-two-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of returning to the Northeast club, which is currently in third place in the First League, with three points less than the lead.
This summer he moved to the Light Stadium after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I was on the B-team and that was it," Ross told the sportsound BBC Scotland show.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampton with my dad as a child, and it always dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity would be offered only if I were successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sanderland's managers include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyette and Paulo Di Canio.
Former club chief Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel restless because he comes after such big names at such a big club, after refusing the Barnsley and Ipswich Town offers.
"The measure of my success at this point will be "will I be able to return this club to the Premier League?"
Judging from the structure and capabilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It is not an easy task to bring him there, but I think I will be able to be successful only if I can get the club back where it belongs."
Ross is only in his third year of management career, after a period he spent as an assistant chief in Dambarton and 15 months spent as part of Harts' coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the fall in the third category, and St. Miren dragged from the edge of falling in the lower league to the winner of the Championships next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkark, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," Alloa said.
"I honestly believed management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I wasn't bad, I made a decent living and enjoyed some solid success.
But playing can be hard.
There's so much you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but management just suits me.
I've always wanted to do management, and now I'm doing it, and in my entire adult life, I haven't felt more comfortable than I have now."
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday 30 September on the Scottish Radio from 12.00 to 13.00 on British Summer Time
The perfect time for a glass is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave increased the traffic of British pubs struggling to survive, but increased pressure on the restaurant chains.
In a group of pubs and bars, sales growth of 2.7% in July was achieved, but the traffic in restaurants dropped by 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, a consultant at the CGA, who collected data, said: “The permanent solar time and longer than expected participation of England at the World Cup contributed to July following a similar pattern as the previous month of June, when the pubs achieved a 2.8% increase and the restaurants had an even higher drop.
The fall in traffic in restaurants of 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars focused on drinking achieved far the best result with higher growth compared to comparable results from the previous period, than the decline in traffic in restaurants.
The pubs focused on food also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurant owners.
Seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6% per month, with a decline of three percent."
Paul Newman, of the RSM entertainment content and catering agency, said: “These results have continued the trend we have been witnessing since late April.
The weather and impact of major social and sporting events are still the main factors when it comes to selling on the market outside the household.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight hard, although the fall of 4.8% on an annual basis will be particularly painful with the already present price pressures.
A long hot summer could not come at a worse time for food-focused caterers, and time would show whether the moderater temperatures we had in August would provide little over the necessary relief."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, amounted to 2.7% in July, reflecting a slower introduction of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, an industrial sales tracking service in the bar, pub and restaurant sectors in the UK, collects and analyses data on the impact of 47 business groups with a total turnover of more than £9 billion and represents an accepted industrial measure.
Every fifth child has a secret order on social media that hides from their parents
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years of age, has a secret warrant on social networks that hides from his parents and teachers, reveals research
A survey of more than 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
This news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "prime" warrant pointing out to their parents
Every fifth child, of whom they are only 11 years old, makes orders on social media that hides from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in the higher grades of elementary school revealed a rapid rise in "false Insta" warrant, referring to the Instagram photo sharing site.
That news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main" warrant that showed them to their parents, but they also had private orders.
One mother who came across a secret page of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenage girl who calls others "rape me."
A survey conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) revealed that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted to having private assignments.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said, "It's disturbing the fact that so many teenagers come into temptation to create a space on the Internet where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle to be "a voice of athletes" on the Scottish athletic board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as executive director at the annual assembly of that governing body.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who lead sports to benefit from her rich international experience during the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, UK and around the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its membership in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of an athlete, and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold medals, including the 200-400-metre win at the 1996 Atlanta Games, and now a regular expert at the BBC, remained motionless after he suffered a transitory ischaemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time could show if I would recover and how much.
It was a hard job, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing the agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
An advertisement for a traitor comparing mothers with cows shared opinions on the Internet
The company that manufactures the traitors shared opinions on the Internet with a breast-feeding commercial that compares with the cows of the musars.
In order to mark the launch of a product described as "the first silent traitor", the consumer technology company Elvie published an advertisement inspired by a fun music video showing the freedom the new pump gives to mothers who give milk.
Four real mothers dance in a barn between hay and cows with a song that reads, "Yes, I husband but have no tail" and "If you haven't noticed, but it's not a name, it's my breasts."
The chorus follows: “Pump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, milk myself. ”
However, the advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video caused different viewer reactions, while many said it sheds light on the "sacrifices" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
And they have to get pregnant and have babies just like us to produce milk, but their babies get kidnapped a few days after birth," someone wrote.
The pump for issuing Elvie discreetly stops in the breastplate (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It’s clearly traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a traitor for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "Adverts make no sense."
Others stood in the defense of advertising, and one woman admitted that her song was "heavenly".
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy this if I were still breast-feeding.
Betrayal made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little silly, but I figured it out.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Another commented: “This funny commercial is directed at mothers who give milk (often in a workplace or in a toilet) and feel like ‘ cows. ’
This isn't a commercial that praises the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they all danced with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the knowledge that many mothers who give milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is totally silent, it has no wire or pipe, and it becomes a breastplate, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even come out while they give milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother’s company, commented: “Pumpa Elvie is such a revolutionary product that she deserves bold and provocative launch.
By pulling the parallel between the suckling cows and the musar cows, we wanted to focus on the milk issue and all the challenges that go with it, showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump got into newspaper headlines.
During the Week of Fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the runway in the creation of Martha Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly transferred to tent camp at the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants has increased although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to find caregivers for children.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were migrants without documents who were afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by stepping forward to accept the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult household members would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, senior immigration and customs officer, told Congress last week that the service arrested dozens of people who applied for custody of unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the arrested were not previously convicted.
"Nearly 80% of the people who are either guardians or members of the parent's household are illegally in this country, and a good part of them are foreigners who have committed criminal acts.
So we're going to keep looking for these people, said Mr. Albenz.
In an effort to get the children through the procedure faster, officials have introduced new rules by which some of them will have to appear before the court within a month of the detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to workers at the shelter.
Many will report a video call instead of a personal one, so that the immigration judge will seek the law of his status.
Those who are determined not to meet the conditions will be quickly deported.
The longer the children remain incarcerated, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to a outburst of anger or attempted escape, the workers of the shelter and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say that such risks are raised in larger institutions such as the one in Tornillo, where it is much easier to overlook signs indicating that a child has problems.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could cause a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria Seeks Urgent Withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return, even though the war in that country has lasted for eight years.
Moalem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegal in the Syrian country, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly".
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said at the session.
Moualem insisted that in Syria "the war on terrorism is almost over", where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "a holy struggle until we exterminate all Syrian terrorists", including terrorist groups and "every foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mostly in charge of training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country devastated by war.
Regarding refugees, Moualem said there were good conditions for their return and blamed "the members of the Western country" to "widen out irrational fears" that encourage refugees not to return.
"We have invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to allow these returns," he said.
"They politicise what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not help restore Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an end-of-war agreement.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a tampon zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has thwarted a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia in a province where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and voiced hope that a military action against jihadists and fighters from the Nusr front, linked to Al-Qaeda, would be launched "to be exterminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of the authorities and members of the opposition to draw up a draft post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Moualem outlined the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee's work, saying that the work of that body should be limited to "the consideration of members of the current constitution" and cautioned on the possibility of external interference.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
According to that logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 elections unless, to what many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the recall and scandals earlier end his mandate.
This would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end of the presidential term of all time!"
So far, there's no sign of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, the rating has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers on strike dates, compared to four years ago when it was 1.7 million, and the Rachel Maddow Show Channel MSNBC broadcast exceeded cable channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers during the evening with breaking news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of the "Elected survivors" drama on the ABC channel, about the government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a longtime comedy writer and author of the book “Only Funny Parts: And a few harsh truths about putting into a club of Hollywood boys”, has a different theory.
She remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she'd vote for Trump.
She asked.
"He said, "because it makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos also has a fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming from Washington can decide the future of abortion laws under Roe v. Wade's procedure, whether immigrant families can join together and what the global economy will be like.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you went a little further than general information when you realized that for six hours you watched a panel of experts arguing about how Bob Woodward used "deep background" sources for his book "Fear," about Paul Manafort's jacket of ostrich skin worth $15,000 (a suit with a fat attitude), wrote Washington Post) and the implications of vivid descriptions, this, anatomy, by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never see Super Mary with the same eyes again.
"The part of what he makes you experience as a reality show is that something feeds you every night," said Brent Montgomery, Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the creator of the show "The pawnshop", commenting on the rotation of the acting set and the daily complications of Trump's show (the criticism of the American football league, the praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you're behind.
When I got to Mr. Fleiss this week, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunny at a temperature of about 80 degrees (27 °C), but he shut himself in and watched MSNBC and recorded CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Justice Commission and his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Big inflow of money on the side in the most uncertain mid-term election race for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the redistribution of congressional districts, resulting in two candidates in the race for the same place.
A recent border crossing in the suburbs of Pittsburgh led to the elections of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who headed the second district following last spring's early elections.
Lamb is fighting another current representative, a republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps largely with the 17th district.
Cards were drawn again after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally formed in favour of Republicans.
In the new 17th district, the race launched a campaign fund-raising campaign between the main party fund-raisers, the Committee collecting funds for a democratic campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in wide-ranging special elections for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania in March.
This position has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point district.
Political analysts have given a slight advantage to the Democrats.
The United States is considering punishing El Salvador for support to China, but then withdrawing
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little encouragement from Washington.
Mr Trump had a cordial meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varrell in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out Trump's organization's steering team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the Department, said in a statement early in the month.
But the penalties were considered only for El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140m of US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and the targeted visa restrictions, would hardly affect this Central American country with a high rate of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which should have been the continuation of a similar last year's meeting that was a step forward in efforts to prevent the influx of migrants into the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held, and that in fact ended any consideration of the sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman, on behalf of Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition that they remain anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next thing is a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on the possibility of Trump's obstruction of justice, on which there is now significant evidence in the public record.
According to reports, Mr Mueller also focused his investigation on finding a possible link between Trump's campaign and Russia's attack on the elections.
If the majority of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he prepares to re-enter the voters, perhaps even before a jury.
There are many of those "if" and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is, or those in Europe that are similar to him, inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German soldiers were ready to strike against Hitler, only to have the West oppose him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the chance to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such breaking points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing more of these breaking points.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires the deputy chief prosecutor, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an unappreciative position since this paper reported last year that he has proposed a covert recording of the president and suggested that it is not similar to performing the function.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times statement is incorrect.
"How will we react if the newly ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite compelling allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And on top of all this, will we vote in the mid-term elections for Congress that will call Mr Trump to account?
If we fail those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I don't think we're going to fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country in which I am ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on that table with the chicken cross.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after an impressive rally in Spain against Villarrel early this month, would put them in a good position to qualify from the G European League.
The knee injury prevented a union player named Graham Dorrans from debuting this season until an unsolved match with Villareal final score of 2-2, but he is convinced that the Rangers can use this result as a stepping stone for further action.
"It was worth a point for us because Villareal is a good opponent," said 31-year-old player.
"We went into the game believing that we could achieve something and went with the point.
Maybe we could have taken them all the way, but all in all, the unresolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we were back in the second and we were better.
On Thursday, the big European evening awaits us again.
We hope we can take three points, but it'll be a tough match because they had a good score in the last game, though, with the support of the audience, we can certainly push and achieve a positive result.
Last year was doubtless difficult, starting with everything that happened to my injuries until the changes in the club itself, but now we're happy with what we have right now.
The team is in good shape and the boys really enjoy it; we train well.
I hope we can continue now, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep out of worry about pension savings
Despite the fact that the subjects had a clear picture of how they would like to be cared for, few discussed this with their family members.
About half of those surveyed by Nationwide said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10% of them said they talked about it with their kids.
"People want someone from the family to take care of them, but they don't want to start a conversation on the subject," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Life Insurance Sector at the Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Cooperate with your counselor and family and consider where and how to receive him, for such decisions can be a significant factor in determining the price.
Include your financial adviser: Your adviser can help you and figure out a way to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care funding choices can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value that will help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own savings – provided you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop legal battles in the root.
Create a medical assistance decision to enable you to have a trusted person to monitor the medical care provided to you and to ensure that healthcare professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider the conclusion of a financial authority agreement.
That means choosing a person of trust who, on your behalf, will make financial decisions and take care of paying your bills if you remain powerless.
Do not forget the minor details: imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation where he needs emergency medical attention and is taken to a hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please provide details in your written plan to be ready.
"It is not just about the finances, but also about who the doctors are?" Martin asked.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it."
A man shot with multiple shots from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with multiple shots from an air rifle as he walked home from his night out.
The victim, in her forties, was located in Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The officers described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. towards British summer time, as "a random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries weren't life-threatening, and the police called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pal on Friday, officials said, and the number of dead growth is expected.
As the link ended, aid officers could not obtain any information from the Dongala province, areas north of Palu, near the 7.5 - degree earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated to Palau after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggali, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by a earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of the coast in the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is an administratively low-ranking province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are based on the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, and especially the coastal region of Donggal.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggal have been hit by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggal.
Tsunami also hit West Donggal in 1996 when nine people were killed.
Indonesia is on a seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26th triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 degrees hit the south of Java, the most populated Indonesian island, triggering a tsunami that swept the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake struck Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatre, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami destruction of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died in the demolition of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people lost their lives, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained temporarily captured.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of committing domestic violence, obstructing family violence and resisting arrest, according to a report published Saturday by the National Police Agency of Alaska.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was detained in the Mat-Su detention unit, and a $500 bail was set for him, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday to question the plea of guilt, stating that "it is certainly not his fault," the network said.
Palin is facing three Class A violations, which means he's facing a prison sentence of up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a class B violation, which is punishable by a penalty of one day and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing family violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sara Palin was criticized by the VET groups in 2016 after bringing her son's violent behavior into contact with PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake that caused the tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes.
The linkage and supply of electricity have been cut off, and the death toll is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake epicenter was right next to the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show a moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palo when the tsunami splashed over the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a terrorist suspect in New York City.
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saip, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare sentence that has not been executed for federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented truck of the company Home Depot to carry out an attack on a cycling track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he robbed pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip's "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a request for a death sentence, filed in the South District of New York.
At both points it is possible to impose a death sentence, the court's document states.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury accused Saip of 22 counts involving eight counts of murder and racketeering, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as allegations of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing how Saipov performed it as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlija, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," said the application for punishment.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York last had a case where the death penalty was threatened.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty in a federal case in New York was executed in 1953 over Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to carry out an attack, the indictment said.
He also asked to highlight the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saip, said they were visibly disappointed by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty will only extend the trauma of these events to all involved, instead of accepting life imprisonment without the possibility of being acquitted," Patton said.
Saip's defense had previously asked the prosecution not to impose the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the national army" during a protest at a conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the discontent" of the Eurosceptic, as one of the Members of the Therese May suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would "go out" so far that Mr Farage was the secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge facing Mrs May in her attempt to unite her deeply divided ranks was stressed by conservatives who advocate staying in the EU and who have joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is working to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite attacks by supporters and opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it continue its efforts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite negative reactions, and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bone said at the meeting to go to Solihull that he wanted to "refuse Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be given the title and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have left by now," he said.
A Wellingborough MP added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel Chequers."
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr Bone dismissed allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and that they want to remain completely incorrect."
A supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the meeting, told reporters: “I only say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who went out into the streets and chose us.
"Please reject the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a sharp note to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers manage to keep their jobs when they keep their promises. ”
Mr Farage told the group that politicians must make themselves "sufficient" if they are about to fail the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "you won't get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel dissatisfaction.
"We are mobilizing the national army of this country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become independent, self-reliant, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the remnant marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour rally downtown.
Several activists waved banners "Torijci v. Brexit" after forming a group this weekend.
Laburist Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's application at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the "Canada plus plus" plan, for the smooth state at the borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
Good Brexit is not possible," he added.
Warren is planning to seriously consider running for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that a native from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a participatory meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, frequent critic of President Donald Trump, re-elected in November against the Republican representative at Geoff Diehl House, who was co-chairing Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She's at the centre of speculation so she can face Trump 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the electors who had used the participatory format of the meeting since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if she planned to run for president.
Warren turned the clock on how long it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our corrupt government, and that includes a woman in charge."
Arrest after he was shot by LSU Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday's arrest of a shooting suspect who was killed Friday by a basketball player named LSU Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Station announced the arrest of Dytheon Simpson, 20, at the 11:00 press conference.
A video of a shooting was posted Friday, asking for help finding the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near campus Southern University early Friday.
Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247Sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene of a crime, in possession of a weapon, and that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the police station in the Eastern Baton Rouge district.
A 6-foot-6 boy who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims last season played 32 games with 10 starts and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 hits and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Gran Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the order ensures him victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Waltheri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that the order of the teams would play a great role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the beginning and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton behind to engage in traffic at the beginning, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes went into boxing one round later and went behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the action wheel from the wheel which made the Ferrari driver reluctant to leave the free interior at the risk of falling behind after a double move in defense of the third bandage.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then ran most of the race by relying on his tires to get to the fast finish and passing Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally got into boxing in the 44th round, but failed to speed up the pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a tough day because Walttery's been doing a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman for letting me through.
The team has done a truly remarkable job to perform one or two formation finishes," Hamilton said.
That was a very bad speech from the body.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinsten at Saturday's rally for insisting that she did not release a letter to the public from Christine Blasey Ford in which the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly testify to Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are evil, mean and lying.
The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and vicious and lying, he said.
When you look at the announcements and the information they leaked to the public, and then they say, oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak the information?
Do you remember her response? Did you release the document to the public?
Oh, no.
I didn't let it out."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we let... No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford Feinstein sent a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked in early September -- however Feinsten denied that the information had been leaked from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't release her story to the public." Feinstein told the board, Hill reports.
She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret, as she asked."
But her denial did not come up with approval by the president, who commented at the rally Saturday night: let me tell you, it was really a bad body speech.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president insisted that Democrats use these allegations for their own purposes.
They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see wickedness, wickedness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control," Mediate broadcasts the president's words.

Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the tie before Dwyer regained the lead of Giants.
Francois Bouchard tied up for Dundee before two naked Lucas Lunvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elte League season for Adam Keef's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season of the two sides, and the Giants won the previous three games.

Air traffic controller has lost his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board avoid an earthquake.
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he died by securing the safe takeover of several hundred people.
More than 800 people were killed, and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong subsequent earthquakes continue to hit this area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palou.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled trying to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonyus Gunavan Agung refused to leave his workplace in a control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Palu Airport that rocked strongly.
He stayed to secure the safe takeoff of Batika Air Flight 6321, which was standing on the runway at the time.
When he realized that the control tower was collapsing, he jumped off it.
He passed away later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balipan in Kalimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palua.
The heart breaks because of this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims could reach thousands, while the state agency for mitigating the consequences of disasters states that access to Donggal, Siggy and Boutong cities is limited.
The number of victims is believed to continue to rise as many bodies remain below the ruins, and many cannot be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said.
Waves that reached altitudes of up to six metres have devastated Pala, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: Emergency vehicles import bodies every minute.
The government is running out of clean water.
Small stores are looting everywhere."
Jean Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: Indonesia's Red Cross is in a hurry to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there."
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the military of that state: I ask all of you to work all day to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok, where more than 550 people were killed.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini announces that after a plane crash in a lagoon, one face leads as missing.
A airline whose aircraft crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia announced that one person was being led as a missing person, after it had previously announced that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini states in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon they are unable to trace the passenger.
The airline says they are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water in an attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline announced that six more passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the fall and what was the exact sequence of events.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane ended up in a lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some eyewitnesses think the plane has crossed the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to break through to the emergency exit through the water that hit their waist on a sinking plane.
He said the crew was panicking and screaming, and he suffered a head injury.
The US Navy said that the sailors who worked nearby at the port repairs also helped save the boat by pumping them to the shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet).
Air Safety Network data indicates that in the accidents, the airline registered with PNG in the past two decades has suffered 111 people, but that none of them participated in Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructs the sequence of events the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution closed the case Saturday in a retrial against a man accused of burning a live woman in Mississippi in 2014.
US Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
Before the jury, he said he was using cell phone data to compile a picture of the movements of the accused Quinton Tellis, 29 years old, and the victims of Jessica Chambers, 19 years old, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that the location data was obtained from several phones that show that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which is contrary to his earlier claims, is transmitted by The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford, testifying on Saturday, said he wasn't in town that day.
Asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanfrod said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed to have met Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett was that Tellis had erased her messages, calls and contact information from his phone after Chambers' death.
He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defence should begin Sunday with the final word.
The judge said he expects the jury's trial to proceed later in the day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop wants to try to challenge the negative attitude towards the genre by filling their compositions with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip-hop has moved away from its beginnings when it deals with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and get their popularity back to the conscious hip-hop.
Artists like the Fugees and the Common are once again gaining popularity in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person? !
The New York nanny is suing a couple for dismissal after a racist text message.
The New York nanny sues a couple for dismissal on a discriminatory basis after mistakenly receiving a text message from the mother in which she complains that she is another black person."
A couple deny they're racists, judging the lawsuit as extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her dissatisfaction when, upon her arrival on the first working day 2016, she realized that she was the new nurse of the children, Giselle Maurice, a black woman.
Another black woman," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
When she became aware of her gaffe, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their former nanny, who was an African-American, had been doing a bad job and had been expecting a Filipino instead, was transferring the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a fee for one day's work and a Uber sent home.
Maurice is now suing a couple for damages for dismissal, as well as a fee of $350 a day for six months, on what she was originally engaged to live with the family, even though without a contract.
I want to show them, you see, you can't do such things," she said on Friday for the Post, adding that I know it is discrimination."
The couple, on the charges of racism, returned that the cancellation of Maurice's engagement was reasonable because they feared that after they insulted her they would not be able to believe her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco told the Post husband.
But would you entrust your children to someone you have offended, even though it was done by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on."
"Plassco said his wife only received two months of maternity leave and was in a very difficult situation."
You're gonna chase someone like that?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although court proceedings are still under way, the public court was quick to condemn money on social networks, criticising them for such behaviour and thinking.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says about the letter: It is difficult to put yourself in the position of someone who reads it for the first time before publication.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's success."
Saying that her father, who before being inspired by a tiny teddy bear to write a book for children, would work for the BBC as a cameraman, still be positive if his work were rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of publishing the book was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
She added that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family."
He was a quiet man, he didn't like to brag," she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child accomplish something and you're proud of him, even though it's not really your fault.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in some way.
Though he was the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
Her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors fought for nothing to save her life.
Above regularly called to say it was bad, and they did not expect to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me to say that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
I did it, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping blood slowly stopped working and didn't run through her bloodstream anymore.
She died just a few moments before that, and it all went out.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing what was coming.
I couldn't scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be together."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now saddened by her daughter's death, boarded a plane along with other passengers, who had no idea of the pain she was going through.
No one knew," she said.
I bowed my head, and tears flowed down my face constantly.
It's hard to explain, but during the summer, my compassion for Hope overwhelmed me.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
The grieving women leave messages to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide want to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Welsh bridge are putting up cards with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression to commit suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a prospective chef with contagious laughter.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would shine on every room."
But before he died, he left work because he was in a very dark phase."
Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always worried about the consequences."
Mrs. Davis came up with these cards so people would know that there's someone you can talk to and who you can talk to, even if it was just a friend.
Don't sit there and keep quiet - talk to me."
Mrs. Humpreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
He didn't say he was in a mood, depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
At Christmas he was at the very bottom - when the children opened their presents he didn't look them in the eyes or anything else."
She says that his death for them was a huge trauma, but that they must endure it: it leaves a huge void in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we'll move on and fight."

With the opening of an FBI investigation, Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain.
I thought that if we were really able to get something out of what he was looking for -- an investigation of limited duration and volume -- it might bring us together somewhat," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he is afraid that the committee is falling apart" due to irreconcilable party views.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their nausea was caused by a choice of moments.
The congressional elections are held for only five weeks, November 6th, and if the Republicans pass badly, it is expected, their attempts to be elected to the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush phoned senators on Saturday, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and met his wife Ashley through him, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes his report?
It will vote in the Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavnaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to decide by his vote and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors from North Korea is dropping under Kim.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislator said.
Referring to data from the South Korea United Ministry, Park Byeong-seug states that 1127 defectors were registered last year compared to 2011 when the number was 2706.
Mr. Park said that two decisive factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs charged by human smugglers.
Pyongyang hasn't made a public call.
The vast majority of refugees from the north are eventually offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than the firmly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees illegal, not refugees, and often returns them.
Relations between the North and the South -- which are technically still at war -- have been seen to have improved in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss stopped denuclearisation negotiations.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where there was broad agreement that he would work on denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for his lack of progress so far.
Without confidence in the US there is no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances it is not considered that we are the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally," the RI said in his address at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh hysterical," saying he was unfit for service in the Supreme Court.
Minority leader at Nancy Pelosi House called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh hysterical" and said that because of his temperament, he is unfit for service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if I ever acted like this, I would call myself hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at the time they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and snuggling when he was talking about his family and his high school years,
He also explicitly condemned the democrats on the board, evaluating allegations against him by grotesque and orchestrated attacks on his personality" organised by liberals to anger that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosy said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not perform his function in the Supreme Court since it demonstrated his bias at the expense of the Democrats.
I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he went against the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Asked if they would try to call Kavanaugh back if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi stepped out.
I will say the following - if he does not speak the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he is not similar not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently the judge of District Court of Appeal District Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she is concerned about possible Kavanaugh verdicts against the Act on Access to Health Care or in the case of Roe vs. Wade, since they consider him a conservative judge.
At the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions as to whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to be put in court and we are expected to say that it is not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
Justifiable anger, anger that's been gathering for months and years, and she can't get rid of it without pay.
We cry when we're angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, what do you say?"
She continued: I was greatly helped by a woman who was somewhere executive, who said that she was crying when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that seemed to imply that when she got angry and started crying, the person she would talk to said you might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then I'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great."
Tears are allowed a way to throw out anger in part and because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of my earlier work, in an office where most of the men were men, is that when I once cried for indescribable anger, an elderly woman -- a cold boss I was always a little afraid of -- grabbed my neck and pulled onto a staircase.
I never let them see me cry," she told me.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
When Hart was caught in an out-of-marriage affair on the boat of Moneky Business in 1987 and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she told me through laughter 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snow White and seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already advanced, she was lagging behind in fundraising, and she vowed not to enter the race unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, would give her only $250.
Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions -- thanks to the people who supported her, with frustration over the system that made it difficult for her to collect funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and with anger over showiness -- which made her feel tight in her throat.
You would think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
You'd think that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd put on my gravestone?
"She cried."
How trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The first canonades of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and until the end of the battle is seen, discord between countries in the long term may be of benefit to Beijing, hard-core experts.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired his first warning early this year by taxing key Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest blow occurred this week with new tariffs that hit items worth $200 billion (150 billion), which practically taxed half of all goods coming from China to the United States.
Beijing has returned the same measure every time, and the latest is the introduction of a tariff of between five and ten percent on US goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has vowed that the United States will respond to the same measure, and the second largest world economy seems to be not going to stop soon.
To force Washington to withdraw means to comply with the demands, but public worship of the United States would be too unpleasant for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays its next move well, US pressure in the trade war can positively support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of a steep economic downturn in one of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a researcher whose focus is Asia at the New American Security Centre.
Syria is ready to return refugees," the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding a war-torn country that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas that destroyed terrorists to restore normal life.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that since the beginning of the 2011 war more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could benefit from helping rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or help from the countries that had helped the rebellion.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018, defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National van Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown while a team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn won 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, threw the ball into the water at 16th hole pair 3, leaving the match to Francescu Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been swinging in all rounds, becoming one of four players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament started in 1997 in this format.
American Jordan Speith lost 5-4 from Throbjorn Olesen in Denmark, the lowest-ranking European team player.
The world's best-ranking player, Dustin Johnson, lost two to one from Ian Poulter in England who may have been the last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia, has become the best European tournament winner of all time with 25.5 points in his career.
I don't normally cry, but today I couldn't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy that we won the Cup again.
Here is an important team and I am glad I could be of help," said emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He teaches his countryman John Ram, who beat the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2 to 1 in individual matches on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud that I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that man," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 at Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time who has won the 14 greatest titles and is only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team has been struggling all weekend to find a way to the hole, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played top golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, American captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There were times this morning when we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with PGA America and our board of Ryder Cups and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're out. We're out."
Latest news on the flowering of the sea: concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manteeu and Sarasoti
The latest report by the Fish Conservation Commission and Florida's natural habitat show a general decline in sea flourishing in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to FWC, sporadic blooming has been reported in the areas of Pinellas, Mentee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier County, indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The area of the flowering sea stretches about 130 miles coast from Pinellas County in the north to Lee County in the south.
