Leave them for us.
Here's a map.
Come on, let's get out of here.

What should I do in this situation?
Are you taking the train to school?
Tom won't be at school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who's Tom visiting?
It's Tom, not Mary.
Why don't you invite me for a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I'm not surprised when that happens.

I can't say anything wrong with Tom.
Stand over there and you'll see it better.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we got a laugh seizure.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
Better to be dead than red to live.

According to the Tatoeby directives, members are encouraged to add sentences in their native language or translate them from a language they understand to their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to compose a natural-sounding sentence in their native language.
