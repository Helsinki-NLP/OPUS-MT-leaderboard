At the end of the trade, the Prague stock exchange tipped in the negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange retaliated its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchanges, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed its fall of the previous day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the plan to stabilize the American financial sector, is thus also noticeable in our country.
Fall of actions in Asia
On Tuesday, the Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall, even though the clues managed, during the day, to erase some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Hang Seng Index lost four per cent during trade, but later cleared some of the losses and reduced the decline to almost 2.5 per cent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange lost 3.8 per cent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney stock exchange lost more than five per cent, but ultimately the losses were reduced to 4.3 per cent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 per cent.
"The hesitancy about bailout action in the US will affect financial markets around the world," observed Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it sets its own monetary policy, i.e. independently of China's central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are the same as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will be affected.
The bloodbath of American actions
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the project to support the financial system, to which it should have spent up to $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion from Kč).
Legislators thus deny the call to support President George Bush's plan.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
The American actions had a bloodbath on Monday and the main indices of actions had experienced the greatest fall of the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced a fall of this magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it became clear that the proposal was not adopted, it was in a free fall.
Congress gave way: US government can inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement for the US financial system.
It will be put to the vote early next week.
U.S. legislators made a decisive turning point in the talks on the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of $700 billion in financial assistance (approximately 12 trillion crowns) to the U.S. financial system.
This does not mean that success is safe.
In fact, before the Congressmans can publish the final version of the law and put it to the vote, they must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be reviewed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Says Sunday to Reuters Barney Frank, chair of the House's Banking and Financial Regulatory Committee.
According to sources, as early as Wednesday, the plan should a priori be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major first psychological factor in reviving financial markets.
Given the complexity of the mechanisms by which market aid can be effective, however, there will be a "disillusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the form that the package of measures should have for the stabilisation of the market," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg Agency.
According to her, the final vote could be taken as early as Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, legislators met with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government a final form.
It should buy from financial companies the unsaleable real estate assets that result in significant losses to financial enterprises and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
We still need to pursue this plan to restore markets, but I think we're there," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on declining equity markets.
According to Senator Democrat Harry Reid, legislators are making sure that Congress reaches a final agreement on Sunday.
They want to calm down investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress' decision could affect Monday's trade.
For the time being, it is impossible to state with certainty when the two Houses of the American Congress will proceed to the vote, nor whether the negotiations are likely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by a particular problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
Nevertheless, the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount allocated to the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress has the impression that the program does not perform its function, it has the possibility to block the remaining amount, following two steps: first an additional $100 billion, then, finally, $350 billion.
Bush praised progress in negotiations
Although the president can put his veto to this decision, Congress has the opportunity to put him in a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted of obtaining finance for the purchase of bad real estate securities, whose value shuted, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President George Bush is himself pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of Golden Parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chair Christopher Dodd, Chief Negotiator, said that legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors against losses, the relief agreement, the timing of the plan.
The new law also provides for the limitation of these golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the programme and establishes a committee, which will monitor the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides assistance to homeowners, who have problems to pay.
The government should negotiate new down payments in the case of mortgages that it will redeem, while reducing the monthly instalments of debtors and allowing debtors to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
According to Patria Finance Chief Economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to achieve.
"And this is due to the fact that we don't know what the mechanism and the price will be for the buyback of problem assets.
This point will be decisive in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week at server iHned.cz.
If the plan is adopted now, or early next week, is, according to Marek, not that important.
"It is much more important that the Congressmen agree, this week, that they support this plan and that they dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, which provides for the adoption of the plan, is the most important at the moment," Marek stressed.
An intense struggle to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clear from this that it is better to buy only one phone.
However, there are sufficient reasons to obtain an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a high-end expensive gramophone to put on Maxim Turbulenc's new album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disc, and from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are piled vinyl records in your shelves, with rock art, jazz or blues, you probably dream of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music while moving, namely compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
Here too, there are categories according to price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would find it difficult to support headphones purchased for twenty crowns on the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also crucial
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just reading music, but these are, of course, unknown functions of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Besides the primary functions, phone calls and text messages, it is able to read music and films, to record them, it has a camera of varying quality and can, for example, serve for navigation.
And if you take Smartphones and communicators into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no fridge knows how to grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are witnessing practically a miracle.
However, the universal character of mobile is not without disadvantages.
The larger the number of functions you use, the smaller the interval between two reloads.
And reading music is one of the most important energy goingles.
Few mobiles are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this respect, the music players (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly better performing.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you sometimes call from time to time, get yourself, to be sure, a second reload for work - this is valid even for more expensive devices.
This will not be a problem for MP3 players who are able, following a reload, to operate continuously for at least 9 hours, including the least performing ones.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without a special software.
Of course, you can record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without any reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in mobile phones.
As far as readers are concerned, you don't need, except for iPod, any software.
Simply fill, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create themselves a media library classified according to the performer's name, the title of the album, the style, or then according to the judgment of the user.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, like the Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iiver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
In choosing a concrete device, be interested in the lifetime of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it only for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading MP3.
Virtually all mobiles are now capable of doing so.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to music formats that the mobile or player is able to read.
All manage to play MP3 and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have precisely this format.
It is one of the most popular formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also read WMA format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of online music.
You just need to visit, from the mobile phone, the corresponding operator's web pages (or those of another supplier) and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a convincing reason for obtaining a musical motive.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and in most cases is limited to fast-made radio tubes.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, internet, or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their motive on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you still have headphones on you or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use built-in speakers, which have virtually all the mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical mobiles is their price.
The cheapest normally cost less than three thousand.
For a prize of three four thousand crowns, one can have a walkman already very suitable.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best equipped, also equipped with an entrance for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Really anyone can control the most rudimentary readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the control to that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is evident.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of a mobile internet connected by chance, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD type, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones even get away with memory cards of 8 GB.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, choose specialized mobile-walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and thus the ease of the control is closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman series mobiles have the same user menu as separately sold MP3 players, is the one that went the farthest in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a lifetime of the accumulator (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) higher, is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the above mentioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still miss something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned, on many occasions, on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTÚ (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher for us than for the rest of the Union, confirmed this.
Thus, following the European Commission's latest steps in the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may arise - SMS messages sent from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this respect, Pavel Dvo­k, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), who has stated on several occasions that in Czech Republic there was no longer room for another operator, chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with its own network is apparently no longer very lucky (by the way, now it would find only difficult to find frequencies).
However, there is still one possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a considerable drop in prices, to which, subsequently, conventional operators must also react.
Yet, even before the entry of parties such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market, voices similar to those heard today at home were heard in Britain.
However, it became apparent that there was room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator has managed to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator in the country.
In addition, behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which owns among other things the U:fon in Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is that it is possible to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order for them to function effectively, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of building, operating and maintaining the mobile network.
For example, in the world, virtual operators are emerging as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers text messages in Britain at least twice as expensive as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, relying on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity move.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work at home as well.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesman for Vodafone, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services."
In Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very promoting.
The launch of Mobilking will take place instead in other countries in our area," said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesman for the Penta financial group.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can to prevent a potential competitor from appearing.
The GTS Novela Group, which would like to take a new step to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of business customers, has not for long been hiding its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We want to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility several times with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to make progress in the negotiations," says the spokesman for the Pavel Kaidl Group.
So the future may be promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that we could perhaps host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for the moment, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At the moment, we do not feel that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific ones.
For the time being, no subject with a complex and serious project in this field has contacted us," mentioned Vlastimil Srše+ of the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokesman Martina Kemrová states in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: "It is virtually excluded that a virtual operator will appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
In order to operate in such a limited period of time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone instead directs his attention to completing requests to obtain his own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This, in our view, means the most input from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to set up a common network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities: in tune with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a drop in prices and thus to a decrease in their profit.
What is the point, then, of facilitating the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to get along with themselves as the larons at the fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also bears witness to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on ČTÚ at the time of the creation of the U:fon was that exerted by T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the ČTÚ web pages.
Today, however, the U:fon is ready to use as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted on this subject: "Competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile RT market, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would subject him, and especially his services, to high demands."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
However, it is not only the attitude of the ČTÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
The latter belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
In the face of this problem, the latter adopted its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question concerning the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No agreement of this kind has been reached at the moment, because the offer of potential interested parties has not a priori presented sufficient interest for conventional operators," said in response to our question Kristián Chalupa of the External Relations Department of the ÚOHS.
A statement formulated in this way would not surprise operators' representatives.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a declaration is more than confusing.
All the more so as Kristián Chalupa adds: "In other countries, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephone services."
However, pressure for an honest functioning of the market and lower prices is apparently not part of the interests of the ÚOHS.
What is indeed shocking is the almost touching harmony of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, arises quite naturally.
Similarly, a price of gasoline that is strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to chance and hard competition.
"The Office has not noticed any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore none has a corresponding increased responsibility for its conduct on the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even from the telecom regulator," he said in his Chaloupa statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of discord.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications are, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different vision: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, it is necessary to obtain, on each occasion, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
This is how he necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
Even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are proceeding visibly in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the company GTS Novela, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
ČTÚ is a fairly common turn in communications, through which the ÚOHS washes its hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to pass on to the recently adopted telecommunications law an extension of the powers of the ČTÚ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement in the situation.
This, the representatives of the ÚOHS must know very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work.
However, the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operators, many in Czech mobile networks, remains undetected.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services, but the latter are only partially public.
In most cases, there is talk of multi-level marketing firms.
Specific mobile telephone services are offered, for example, by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually reach only elected officials.
The magic trick consists in the fact that the company does in front of the operator is a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special price offers (and others).
What is problematic is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you're talking about happened, it could be a breach of the contractual terms that we would be examining and that could lead to a cessation of collaboration with the company in question," answered our question on this problem Martina Kemrová.
However, it is not likely that an echo of such an activity has not reached the mobile operators' managers.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
An operator, however, does not rule against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them non-negligible benefits, and at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, as usual customers of mobile operators do."
That is precisely what should seem strange in the ČTÚ.
In addition, there is another question to the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has relatively broad powers to be able to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to be content with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions forbid it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought about a considerable drop in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, traditional operators tried to prevent their creation, sometimes more, sometimes less.
The arguments used by the latter were virtually the same - a market too small, or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that regulators in developed countries have intervened, not in the interests of mobile operators, but in the interests of their customers.
Both formal measures and informal pressure resulted in the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are dealing with this issue in the way that a hot potato is disposed of by transmitting it to a nearby target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that the confusion in skills is in these cases more than profitable.
But let's not throw the sleeve after the punch.
If the behind-the-scenes information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear at our home, the Czech mobile market may get back on the move.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will hardly remain impassive in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov mūj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was recorded again by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji ' Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo singing, a choir performance and an instrumental version.
The singing is performed by Kateřina Knánková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem.
You can listen to the four new versions on the server iHned.cz.
Bělohlávek regards Czech national singing as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose for the performance solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to take care that the two singers, as well as the choir, had a good diction, so that the words could be understood, that they could sing simultaneously," he said.
Next year, the Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary.
The song Kde domov mūj first resounded in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetiers), an original Czech play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škorup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
Public transport (MHD) in Prague will introduce the chip into their ticketing system on Wednesday.
Wednesday 1st October 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Pragoise Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible for about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day or 90-day coupon (this coupon will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both have it registered on their smart card at the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, Mřstek, Nádra+ Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letsany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons by internet on the web pages of Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can finally forget the counters in the metro stations, where they had to trample impatience in long queues so far in order to get paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon by internet and they will record it on their Opencard in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these contact points, there is at the disposal of the passengers a counter with trained staff, who will help those interested with the purchase by internet and, moreover, will record the coupon they bought on their card," says the spokesperson of the Martin Opatrný project.
Next to the libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, remind the machines to compost the tickets and the passengers have perhaps already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," added Optrný.
A automaton will control the coupon instead of the driver
The automatons that will work from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Simply insert the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city.
In particular in the peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the communes of central Bohemia mainly use to access the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pražská integrovaná doprava (integrated transports from Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of Filip Drápal tickets of Ropid organisation, which designs the timetables of the public transports in Prague.
The peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's car.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the indicated location on the side of the car.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take the peri-urban buses and do not remember the date when their coupons expire may return to the vending machines, which were originally used to record coupons on the card.
It is here, on the device screen, that the information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
The Sudeten called for a referendum in the USA
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans demanded that Šumava be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the Southern Bohemian).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some Sudeten German groups allegedly addressed the US president with such a desire.
This stems, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans from Český Krumlov in the letter ask the US President not to allow "šumavská župa" (forest region south of Bohemian) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "People, to whom the fate of the Šumava cares".
Since the rallying to Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only brutality, disrespectful attitude, incomprehension, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take in his hands the protectorate of Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a state foreign to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and which in no way contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into consideration the opinion of the quarter million inhabitants," is written in the letter.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would have only to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, in view of current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the then Sudeten Germans.
While the Czech Germans had at least to see that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some were waiting for the United States and Great Britain to gain some kind of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German of České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the English and placed in the capture camp of the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him for him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," said Chalupa.
None of the Germans captured who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, according to him, felt that, following the Beneš Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You're not thinking - you're paying!
Emotional campaign to attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way of characterizing the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The Minister's Office is of the opinion that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, on radio, in cinema, on the internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and drinking while driving.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, it wants to touch the consciousness of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
It also bears witness to the slogan "sangling" throughout the campaign:
You're not thinking - you're paying!
The phrase "You don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
Then, in a puddle of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
Which must symbolize that one can pay for life for a moment of inattention.
The spots will "hanter" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where we can see commonly images with drastic images of victims of accidents.
He believes that this will lead to a reduction in the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whip against drivers
"What works with drivers is the system of sugar and whip.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they burn a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded to the drivers," says Martin Koán, the transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, according to the psychologist.
According to him, signs that signal danger to drivers are already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns against a danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the drivers will not notice it," Ko
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, President of the Israeli Provisional Government, expressed support for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert said on a daily basis.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to yield to the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), since otherwise peace will not be achieved," he added.
He agreed that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all he does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert remarked, alluding to the two attacks in the city in July, during which several people were killed and dozens of people wounded.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historic places" located inside the Old City.
"Anyone who wishes to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he stressed later.
Golan Heights Retreat
Olmert also expressed support for Israel's retirement from the Golan Heights, which he believed was an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts from Damascus.
"I am not proposing to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a Golan retreat," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollah (Shiite Movement); they will have to give up the constant support they give to the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite Movement), Al-Kaida (Terrorist Network), as well as that of Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are stewards in the bus illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus of the Student Agency near Padua, Italy, arises the question whether stewards and passengers can travel within the coach during the journey.
"If we want to strictly and formally respect the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road to the coach.
The girl was at this moment unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she has at her disposal two other seats.
However, the bus may have an accident or even a sudden brake, also when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is equipped with standing or not seats by virtue of its technical data sheet.
If this standing equipment is not approved, the passengers shall remain seated.
The Student Agency long-distance buses do not have standing seats; this was confirmed in Aktuálně.cz by the director of Radim Jančura.
"This is a matter that we dealt with with the department and, at first, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilet during the trip provided they have their own seat," he revealed his position.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the steward role - there is no legal prescription for that role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement also prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," adds with more ambiguity the spokesman Hanzelka.
Josef Pokorný, the head of the road vehicle traffic department, believes, on the contrary, that the law adequately addresses the problem.
"It depends on the fact that the coach has permission in its approval to offer standing places.
Everything is in there," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas, where there are standing positions and a limited maximum speed, inter-city with standing positions and a higher authorized speed, and long-distance coaches without standing positions with the highest authorized maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As on the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hoúñn, expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) in transport safety, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"During regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of the service in the aircraft.
Neither is it safe when turbulence occurs and the air hostess can hit her head."
"Now, in the event that the bus would have braked abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards by internal requirements," he said and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is ready to abolish these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer steward services.
He's hiring two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their trade to be a risky trade.
"Nevertheless, as soon as I have the impression that this is a risky trade, I will delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper upon boarding.
It would also reduce costs," he says.
The safety concern is the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles by the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We have no hostesses. We oppose them from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, in Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has happened.
A young hostess from the Plze+ region, who had been working for the company for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop strip without using a flashing signal and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter tried to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he approached it by his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards have been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but as far as the financial compensation is concerned, it also relies on the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the Act, which has been being developed for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could clarify the movement of stewards aboard the bus.
"However, it did not reach any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile at the wheel," says expert Ho
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," concludes spokesman Hanzelka, stating that the control of the safety of buses is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfese rest on Frankfurt.
The great words were not lacking in the letter from the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse financial group" could be formed, according to the letter made public on Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "bloc of competence" with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive starting point for further mergers in the Länder banking sector.
This is what it looks like when an Executive Board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the injured WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
It was not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Authority for the Supervision of Financial Services which, only recently, made it clear to the government of North Westfalia's Land of Rheinania that time was running out in the search for a future solution.
However, for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side - there has been talk of a relationship of some kind between Deka Bank, which knows Sparkasse's customers through their investment funds, and WestLB.
Certainly the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas indicated during the presentation of the figures of the semester at the end of August that he saw no meaning in the merger of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, either Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Deka Board of Directors, each half of which is supported by the banks of the Länder and the savings banks, has instructed the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB for joint commercial activities.
This could then be the debit of the financial market, or parts of it.
The talks, however, have only just begun, they say, in the financial centre.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, with its 3000 employees, counts for one of the largest employers in Frankfurt's financial centre, comes into play when it comes to the consolidation of the savings banks sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a while that the Deta-Bank could merge with the bank of Rhineland Palatinate and the Halbab.
Nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
The plans had hardly been made public that the government of the Land of Hesse ruled against any Hellaba participation in them.
Subsequently, neither did the other two houses join.
The bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate was connected instead to the bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new deals on the grouping of the Deka-Bank with banks in Länder.
Finally, Günther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, had, however, ruled against any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
Regardless of this, there seems to be a growing feeling that the consolidation of the various institutions in the public sector is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Bavarian Land Parliament has passed, a BayernLB union with the Baden-Wuttenberg Land Bank could take shape first.
For the Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure for new mergers was to increase, the potential partners were gradually escaping.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has so far been more resistant to the crisis than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The grouping of savings banks and transfers of Hesse-Thuringe, which owns 85 per cent of the capital of Helaba, however, drew a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
The NordLB would remain strict.
Such geo-strategic thinking, however, reflects only one aspect.
Another facet raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can be combined.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely, by which business model the future capacity of the Länder' banks should be ensured, had not so far been resolved by the German grouping of savings banks and credit transfers.
In the long run, a WestLb stripping could take place, which is obviously not desired here.
That is also what is referred to in the letter of the current Executive Board: in any event, a 'global solution' would be sought for the establishment.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank still remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies her as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, close to a five-litre barrel of beer from the Kaiser brand, stands a well-built beard that shows about 200 visitors to the beer festival what deep sounds its gosier can produce.
Elena first taps Luca, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puorta nueva train station, four buses take departure this evening at 11:45 pm, `destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arrival scheduled at 6:30 am.
Three buses are reserved above all for Italians, in one of the buses travel exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing back and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also loud, says Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with fake fur and glasses with wide silver frames.
For the past five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three fired just this year.
They go at night, stay at the party, and come home at 10:30.
Spending the night there would entail unnecessary costs, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a manager of the German speaking group - Marco did a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses drive in the night on the Autostrada towards `Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet on the bus, travellers sleep.
It's better that way, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while many other buses with Italian license plates will once again take a break shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco's group finally arrived at 6:30 a.m. as planned in the parking lot near Place Thérèse, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First: to dress with the small yellow cap.
Above is written to the left `Beer Festival', in gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency `conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
Second: 'When the doors of the beer tent open, we run', Marco shouts in the early morning.
`Run!' Run and reserve seats at the bottom of the tent.
`Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, we must divide them in the room!'
The chope, shouts Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the instructions!
`Show security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: `Tonight, be back here at ten and a half o'clock!' Got it?
And that's it, it's gone to the beer party.
On the way, someone drowns yellow hats with trees to find the path, signs and even an election poster of a great Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'Week-end of the Italians'.
There are no precise figures; 50,000 people are talking about getting on their way across the Alps and collapsing in the beer kiosk, 10 per cent of the visitors would have come on purpose from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tirol police officers, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which compiles statistics on the countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia nights for Hypo Real Estate shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
How fortunate that the politician used the word 'relatively' and slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This one happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), side of the DAX, obtains a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
One person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits are granted up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
Money comes from both private and public-law banks.
In the background, it is the Depfa daughter company that bears the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced himself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since the mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and the own capital rate had also slightly weakened from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current and net profits from financial transactions had fallen to zero from the same period in the previous year, the profits from the allocation of specified receivables and securities and the termination of provisions in credit transactions had fallen from more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
And it was only through the large profits from the repayment of the downstream accounting costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as from the repayment of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies, that the earnings deficit of about 16 per cent proved to be moderate.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier had initially miscured on industrial loans for real estate, which had subsequently been transferred to Aareal Bank.
Because conventional state financing was not profitable enough, Depfa had subsequently become more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private investors and the state (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the daughter company, the Hypo Real Estate must carry out depreciations which should have on the calculation of the gains and losses of the group an essential material effect which remains nevertheless rather vague.
The fact is the dividends have been cut.
Already for 2007, they had been truncated by two thirds.
Since the acquisition of the Depfa, the Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing in the inter-bank market since it has no customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of credit between banks again became considerably timid, with banks having accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a short-term refinancing average of around 50 billion euros per year for all Depfa credits.
According to a statement from the Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing requirement is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets which are currently largely out of order.
Other sources say that refinancing would be ensured through the funds until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the Executive Board of HRE Georg Funke, on the other hand, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to resort to financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for the Supervision of Financial Services (Bafin) assume that the capacity of the Hypo Real Group in the market is now assured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors can only hope for this.
However, in view of the dynamics and unweightedness of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in its entirety.
But neither can the opposite be ruled out.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest communiqués, still at the door of insolvency Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue for the least temporary will not succeed in reassuring the minds either.
The share price fell from 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are particularly good.
While debt in the first place has barely moved, the prices of second-rate loans are declining.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former daughter company Württemberg Hypo and of course those which have a lifetime beyond 2009.
The bonds of the bank Hypo Real Estate previously seemed to be an alternative speculation investment, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the very institute which brought the crisis into the establishment by the acquisition of the bank Depfa.
As long as the issuing institutes, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that arrears will be reduced over time.
Or it will happen what no one dares to hope at this moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that approached safety has now become a simple, well-founded hope.
This should reserve nights of insomnia first and foremost for long-term creditors on whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they have drawn a line on to represent a carry-over of losses for the next few years to the next tax on capital income from automatically collected stock gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop comes to Tachibana Highschool for the first day, the girls start to laugh: German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
What was I excited about?
Already the way to school scared me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way by myself, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be set as strictly as we do in Lower Saxony.
Students appear one after the other from eight o'clock until nine o'clock minus twenty, a round table starts with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not at all into talking to people, especially to a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, as well as a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I showed up in front of the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all done low masses, puffed up with laughter and made signs, and I have constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him thanks to my mangas.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable to the survival of Japanese teens and means "mignon, cabbage".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was assailed in the rules.
Everyone spoke to whom better, laughed and asked me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all took out their Bento.
My foster mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something other than the miserable German snacks.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, a cucumber and seaweed salad, fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating right here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
All right, except maybe the candied salt plums, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and that is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of getting a little better acquainted with the boy during the break.
I read this in my mangas.
I'm curious to know if I could watch it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
So I always said,
"Because it fascinates me, what?"
In the end, reading mangas is what I've preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the mangas and the culture there, at one point, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, us and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have sensations
A rat or cockroach flees from danger, does that mean that he also feels fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we check that he feels the same way when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having so far been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or general consciousness, we enter hard-to-use terrains because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists derive a comparable subjective experience from it.
However, I do not believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult to transpose our subjective experience to that of animals.
One aspect is that circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
So at least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even different from other primates.
Another significant feature could be the linguistic nature of man: a large part of his existence being related to the language, this often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever the way it is produced, would probably differ a lot from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or, because of this particular Hardware, analyze on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses great problems to us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
The processes of animal consciousness could be examined without regard to their content, and this is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the Prefrontal Cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what results then for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we describe as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its aftermath, like the reactions of the body) grabs the living memory.
Thus observed, the emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially man.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volubile nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impute them to others than ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities arise in the areas of the body sensation of the Cortex and the brain stem, as does Jaak Pankseep, who however focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could quite participate in cross-sectional sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe that this is inescapable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in both men and rats is probably also felt as such in both cases: how can one check whether rats and men feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach flees from danger, but if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behaviour is not enough to prove identical experiences.
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, but cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem causing the sensations?
And even if one could prove this for man: how could one prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In all cases, there is a marked increase in the nervous state as the same thing is measured in rats and in humans.
Since I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations, I don't know if they exist.
This could be considered short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly knocking on a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotion.
Platini, UEFA President: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government considers the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise, in collaboration with Poland, the European championships", announced Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We need to work at maximum speed," said President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA keeps our eyes on us all the time."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The commission had met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act properly," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured in a letter to the President of UEFA that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League had already been convicted in the previous season for manipulating compulsory relegation; in the end, the beginning of the League had even to be shifted to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignant counter-attack
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about her private life in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan lifted the veil on her ex-adulter Dennis Quaid.
He's foaming and counter-attacking.
A Late Rose War for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are engaged in a disparaging battle - in everyone's sight and knowledge.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis was long unfaithful to me, and it was very painful."
She would have been aware of the extent of deception only after the divorce.
The motive for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adulterer.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his characterization as an unfaithful husband was clear: it would be "Monstrous," this one told the "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg is re-repainting the history of our relationship and manipulating it".
It would also be "regrettable", that "the pain and upheavals of divorce for each child are revived again in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid remarried and soon became the father of twins.
Thus was his answer to the scratch: "In any case, my life continues.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's doing the best."
Airfares and hotel prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced by up to 50 per cent.
Flights and hotel nights would have become profitable again - this is the result of a study by the financial services and travel provider American Express.
The company analysed its reservation data for the first half of 2008 and established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a sharp decline in profits in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities examined still by 6.9 per cent on average compared with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear mainly in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 per cent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would reside for American Express in the low price of the dollar that led to a "decreasing travel desire of American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by lower hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices stand with a 26.3 per cent increase, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was upwards in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, economy-class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-haul, fuel-intensive flights even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, economy-class ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, business-class and first-class, however, price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 per cent in the second quarter, falling by 23.6 per cent.
The German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
On the one hand, the reasons for this fall in prices would be declining economic growth, explains the firm.
Demand would yield ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased pressure from competition through the Open Skies Treaty, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the abolition by airlines of non-profitable journeys, as well as the high number of airlines that would have deposited the balance sheet in the first half of 2008 - there were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a simple purpose and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first in the rankings.
In the Borussia, Luhukay has still not been able to find a functional eleven.
Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for Marko Marin international player.
Gladbach's player didn't get back into the game until late and his high shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," Hermann Rieger whistled in the dressing room hall of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn't much going on in the locker room, the half-time was over and most had sat down for them.
Rieger was for nearly three decades the physiotherapist of HSV, he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that's why his application was received in strategic positions.
Assistant trainer Cornelius Jol acquiesced and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief coach Martin Jol.
Of which the orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
Putting it into practice has failed.
"Not everything was very beautiful to see today," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhard would have "suhaity also be more relaxed."
This 1:0 (1:0 in the half-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful head strike by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a bad win," said Marin Jol.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate its 121th anniversary on Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, the fans were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first in the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to step back," said Marcell Jansen.
He doubted that the intermediate result of the table more reflected the unpredictable nature of the first League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goaltender Petric as well as Jansen debauché of FC Bayern - is slowly forming, but it does not yet shine.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
On Wall Street, fear circulates.
Early news of the failure of the rescue plan caused the Dow Jones temporarily to fall by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a bit.
At about 8:30 p.m., the world's largest stock market index was 10.579 points, with a drop of well five percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The most losers of the Dow Jones were on that date American Express which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could profit any more.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares declined by almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, the big investor Warren Buffet had partnered with the company.
As part of the rescue plan, resources must be mobilized for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the amount should not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the government should recover options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged correlatively to the evolution of the price in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
The prices of actions sucked into the whirlwind in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not match investors' concerns.
The course of action of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax towards the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index collapses despite the government's planned bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular falls in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The Bavarian real estate financier lost three quarters of its value in spite of the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank recorded a decline of more than 20 percent.
The Dax slid well below the large psychological bar of 6000 points and stood at 5.839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
All over the world, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors were concerned that the US government's $700 billion heavy rescue plan could not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10.809.25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The United States House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout plan, and the Senate vote should follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also had only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index showed a drop of 3.2 per cent at the moment, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index dropped to 11.743.61 points after a 1.26 percent increase.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng Index climbed 2.1 per cent to 18.286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12.595.75 points.
In MDAX, Arcandor's shares fell after the announcement of an increase in capital.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourist multinational has also indicated that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers perplexed: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational support manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying into space.
Because of soon frozen fuel conductions, cryogenic death threatens her.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused disarray among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
The gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes, by which they obtain an additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the Earth.
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the solar probe Ulysses.
This is what has surprised researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave at 100% of the way they are expected according to the venerable laws of gravitation.
More than that, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized him with the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study still believes hard as iron that Einstein was not wrong and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support with the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to the Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-liberation shooting, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom would already be under way.
The Germans are constantly in the kidnapper collimator.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This was reported in concert by Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the broadcasts of Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages were released.
We're checking their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and Romanians and their eight Egyptian escorts are doing well and are safe, the Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the release of the hostages remain unclear: thus, the kidnappers were close to putting an end to the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without shouting at the station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the agent.
All we had to do was collect the hostages, when suddenly, "this surprise" happened.
Sudanese soldiers killed six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom from Germany amounting to EUR 6 million; the money had to be handed over by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers found a safe road to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse of a father-in-law who led to suicide
A court was informed that years of abuse by her father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent assault.
The High Court of Truro referred that he regularly bound his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34 years old, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise tied her up and bandaged her before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother worked at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
Her daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, a volunteer of National Trust, was haunted by the abuses that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
The Attorney General, Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's father-in-law, who had written a confessional letter, which ended up as follows: "I tied him up and bandaged her regularly."
"I didn't sexually abuse her.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim must have been terrorized, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what's even more surprising is the fact that if she hadn't done this, her story would certainly never be over in court."
He added: "I stress in particular, as described by his father and mother, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without these, she would no doubt be a happy, promising and successful young woman today."
Sentence for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office ministerial officer who had forgotten top secret documents on a train in June will be condemned by the Official Secrets Act, known to the BBC.
The Department of Defence man was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents passed into the hands of the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that this case would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of a violation of section 8.1 of the act, i.e. of the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associate Committee of Secret Services.
The documents he lost contained assessments of Al-Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret place.
Building companies facing invoice B&B.
British construction companies may have to pay a bill of over £80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million savers of Bradford & Bingleys.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect the money from savers, including 59 construction companies.
The Managing Director of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said it is "irritating" to know that companies and their members will have to pay for the broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are released.
But the interest that will increase at the same time, will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that collect deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It's irritating to see that institutions that have behaved prudently... now have to pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is claimed that each company must pay a sum in proportion to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will be £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the commercial committee of the building companies, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that the institutions that have behaved cautiously during the recovery of the real estate market, now have to pay for the institutions much less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, dating back to the first years.
"We need to look at all aspects of this case in the coming weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent the building companies and their members from paying this salty bill," said Mr. Cole.
The interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for the entire year, which could double.
Since construction companies are non-shareholder organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five penny per litre
People in Jersey have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk, by five penny per litre, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase that followed a two-penny increase in February, following research conducted by a consulting firm.
Retailers have to decide whether they go in turn, raise the price to consumers.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey's milk was last varied in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh was denied bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a petition for bail to former PM Sheikh Hasina, which could thus be arrested upon his return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him bail because of his indictment for extorting a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729.000.00) when she was PM.
This case is one of many charges directed at him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's lifelong rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within a few weeks, but her party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country's provisional military government first give her full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release were contradictory because if she was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request that she does not require bail because she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafic-ul Huq.
"We will make an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, said a former leader of the Awami party.
She was detained last year after the interim military government assumed power, but was released in June to take care of herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina, like Zhaleda Zia, deny the charges against them.
Concern for the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign, due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
Last week, the United Nations carried out an immunization campaign in all six provinces.
However, she stated that she was unable to contact children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located to the south.
A United Nations spokesman said that this happened despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstruct the thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the judicial battle of ITV
BSkyB lost its case following the decision of the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its shares of ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and had allowed it to influence ITV unfairly.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement to effectively prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from purchasing ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV's shares cast doubt on the effective independence of ITV, thus prompting the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and the regulator Ofcom were all against this purchase.
BSkyB replied that forcing it to reduce its shares of ITV would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just renounced its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. Attorneys case.
The US Attorney General appointed a special accuser to examine the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole was born from the report of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officers, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Accusator Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation, lied to the investigators, obstructing justice.
"Severe, unsubstantiated allegations of potentially criminal conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his most important recommendations.
The dispute began with the delisting in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were dismissed because of poor performance.
But then it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were not more criticized than their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to attribute a political connotation to these dismissals.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others reportedly refused to investigate accusations of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and pursue judicial proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up being accused of being involved in this case of dismissal, and in the end he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers in the Department of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "first responsible" for these dismissals, and ended up "abandoning" his leadership role," remarkably succeeding not to be involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including Bush's former collaborator, Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic will have to be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honoured at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to get this recognition.
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds was the title of the hit of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The award evening is presented by Coldplay, with this year's selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a big voice like Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was traded in the United Kingdom as a single in 1979, ranking in 15th place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the English rankings, and was sold to over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Load- or Marvin Lee Aday, of her real name- has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing an operation to cure her a heartbeat that became irregular, after falling on stage, in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngite forced her to cancel concerts.

A Rue Sombre in the city, often forgotten, and may soon be on sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis and long-time local residents don't know how to get to Extra Place because they've never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and travels north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it looks like a dusty driveway rather than an active artery.
. There are no signs indicating the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repaint Extra Place, and create a smoother transition to shops and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-time neighbours, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because there remains one of the last and oldest streets in the block.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the neighbourhood owners' committees, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal allowing the building builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers to keep the street in the hands of the city, and asked for a new proposal to submit next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the Committee No. 3.
"There are only a few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to restore it and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to refurbish the little street and install seats, some of them would be used by a café to which the builder will grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokesperson, said that although the company wants to operate the street, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to refurbish this abandoned driveway, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale to her."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation of the Immobilier, confirmed that the city wished to sell the street, stressing moreover, that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than to manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named after him since 1802, when the legacy of the large farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since remained abandoned.
The subsequent entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the picture in November 1976.
It was full of scrap, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution towards the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a real rarity- a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be ruined in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who leads a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "Le Livre des Contestations: Un Regard Amérement Nostalgique sur Une Ville dans le Processe d'Extinction") recounts the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The new Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac, dark day and night, and bounded by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and the Persians, full of newspapers of last week that fly along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
An agile short rat at the bottom of the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and which has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffitis on the walls, a bottle of 22 ounce empty beer, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown out.
Some passersby said they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Mr. Field, for his part, said that he felt that some were underestimating the attractiveness of the street in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have taken place in dark, humid and disgusting places."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former California student, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think. Why middle classes should be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Obama's campaign points out that "African American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students."
To combat these differences, Obama's education program supports in particular among so many other topics, "bilingual transitional education" for those who learn English.
However, Obama's question is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education that defends non-English language classroom instruction goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are largely Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of the students, made up of many new arrivals, study English.
Among the students of the CM1, 100% passed the 2008 state exam of maths, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English-language arts examination
This incredible success was achieved thanks to an ingredient other than that advanced by Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, constant assessment of abilities and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Obama could copy," says Linda Mikels, the principal of Sixth Street, "this school has introduced English language instruction "full immersion".
Total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you were going without her class, you would have had no chance to identify her."
"It works," she observes, "it worked for us."
Mr. Obama should not take an example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic English students.
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the prognostic of Obama's response.
Although he is in favour of the fact that immigrants learn English, Obama recently considered this issue insignificant, when he proclaimed that we should all stop arguing about the wording of English-language laws.
"On the contrary, he said, "you have to make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should consider carefully the models of education that work, rather than disdain them or consider them insignificant.
Fall Nette du Pétrole following the New Concerns of the World of Economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday, because people fear that the bailout plan for financial markets will succeed in restoring the economy.
The futures operations of crude oil, dropped by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel. The New York Mercantile Stock Exchange, at this morning's sales.
Prices have dropped by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil on Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After rising to $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in view of the deep uncertainties in the financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again worried despite the agreement on the rescue plan, the biggest in history, concluded this weekend by Congress leaders.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis is durative.
In the very last episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will buy Wachovia Corporation's banking operations," the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts have said that this weekend's frenetic negotiations, concluded with the rescue agreement, seem to have failed to revive the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow down.
"the outlook for global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors."
"we believe that raw materials cannot escape this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and especially in China."
The bank's analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, were therefore forced to decrease oil and gas price forecasts for 2009 by 20 percent.
The Feast of the Determinant Second Time for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending more time in the last eight seasons than anyone else in the Jets Shaun Ellis uniform, the defender thought he saw everything.
He looked at the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Ellis.
The second phase began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played badly under dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor of an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for another two touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from the half.
"I didn't get out of my area" Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"He's a mediocre player."
"We were communicating extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles played wrestling, the defense beat the Cardinals' quarter back, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted her.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of the Bowens ball, might well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a goal of 20 yards taking an advantage of 34 to 0.
That was the best the Jets could score in a while.
"The Jets coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "second or third time?"
When he was told the two- the Jets let pass 21 undisputed points in the third time- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third time.
"A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, surpasses his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, an Ethiopian, once again proved worthy of his title as the best bottom runner of the century, after beating his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory in 2:03:59 of a accommodating race on the flat, Gebrselassie beat his record of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career in which he won the world championship or world record for any distance, from 1600 metres of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing- perhaps exaggerated in today's eyes--that air pollution will increase his asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees on departure, 55 on arrival- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of one mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into background runners, contributed to the decline of the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters, suffered from calf cramps two weeks before, and missed the training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain brilliant, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I got back to it last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best."
He was accused - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's African rival - of having orchestrated his races too much, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually counting on the hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering more the world records than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie's abilities as a background runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. halfway.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the lead disappeared.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final climb to get away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis came third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Englishman Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone to win the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical back pain, but promised to win in Berlin, improving at her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a skilful strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to take a nice advantage, then exceeding them about 18miles 1⁄2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyan, finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city in Part, the Orgueil and the trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, is a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first entirely black city to integrate, the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, this description that she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make nowadays." The city with five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and no prison".
It has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora Festival in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Renaissance Harlem.
And in a variety of ways, the city that she describes- has become a tourist thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project- remains a unique place.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was already in the 1930s, when Hurston told that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "knowing us so little, don't know what he's losing".
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious from the perspective of the foreigner.
"We're very careful about how to tell the story," said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, a resident of the city's oldest parishioner.
"it must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of a black takeover and a community of almost 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point, but also an example of a black rural culture of the South – sometimes disdained, sometimes acclaimed – that recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere books full of dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this city, located just out of Route 17, a road that crosses central Florida, often forgotten, that ends in chapter of black history and human drama.
Audacious as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the property store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parties.
"passed the road to the left," she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its well-preserved gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can be used by passing people.
So, in barely a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with a self-government but also with literacy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well " said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's young girls whom Hurston immortalized, quoting the colorless songs, played by men who praised their beauty."
She added: "some people didn't like it."
Hurston is always remembered as a lively and eccentric person, who came back frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, on a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of the traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many laughed at her.
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he also adds, swinging in his chair from the posterior patio that overlooks Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some grave in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no major commemorations or plaques for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy it offered to the world "declared Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Public officials in Orange County wanted a five-lane highway in town to replace Kennedy Boulevard, a two-lane main street in the community.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the western corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the race-mixing dispute led hatred to the gates of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of young whites came to throw oranges or objects at people sitting on the side," said Mr. Franklin.
"a lady has even died."
They threw a watermelon out of their car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifying of my race".
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some aspects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
"Black children used to be kissed-I remember well-we kissed our master in the morning, and so did the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief director of the Safeguarding of the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until the teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white-I mean there's a cultural demarcation line here," said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston-black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, as it is, armed with a joyous self-confidence and guidelines such as:"How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited Hurston's anonymous grave and began to struggle to revive his reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography on Hurston, by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, reintroduced it to American cannons.
The highway project arrived just when Eatonville's most famous daughter had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider her a saviour.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the festival's inauguration two years later, and many came back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the contée rejected the proposal of the motorway.
"The fiasco of the five-lane highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summed up the whole statement that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been listed as a historic city since 1998.
A single-themed library (renamed Hurston of course) opened in 2006 on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, repaved.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back street on a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(there are now 90 percent blacks)
Foreigners who come to discover the story of Eatonville, its raison d'être, are still treated with caution.
We have to ask permission for most of the interviews, and some things- like the walls of the old Eatonville church, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields- should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weakness for bright red, are always afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston Festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, hardworking, crazy and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is indeed sincere civic affection that is heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for younger ones, like Alondra and 11-year-old Alexia Kenon, twins of Winter Park, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people, who pass through this area, will think:" oh, this city has nothing compared to others" Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it is a very beautiful city".
Here in New York, everyone is fluent in finance.
In spite of everything, nothing has changed.
If the Manhattan tourists kept away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they're in the eye of the cyclone.
Never would they think that in the glass and honeycomb offices above their head, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst "working day at the office" since the crack of 1929.
Deliverers continue to sneak on the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
The Latinos always hang between residential buildings carrying, like mules, some fifty luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke placed on his shoulders.
Office employees continue to queue to buy their morning sandwich from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic narratives until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work at the end of the afternoon, as I discovered at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, about 20 people lining up.
Not in front of cashiers' counters, not to withdraw from the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service counter, where the usual customers ordered their cheques, tourists asked for management for the Macy store, and the new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorized personal banker," were all in line for the same reason as me.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that operate only in one state, and that claim to treat customers as their families.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In the past few days, Washington Mutual, a $327-dollar capital bank has used the bankruptcy trustee, and while the New Yorkers were coming home for the weekend this Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and the store employees who are in front of me, afraid of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that they think is reliable, the one that makes the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the financial world in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket talking on the phone to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and her meagre general manager Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed concierge of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries from my fruit and vegetable dealer.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings into the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take any chances."
Muslim Tombs profaned as Austria swings to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and , Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organisation of "Cities Against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday 17 January 2008.
They carry road signs illustrating mosques striped in red.
Police accuse extreme right-wing extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of extreme right-wing political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged in the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning; according to the police, this is an organized action.
The offenders painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, the detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise the feelings of hatred of extremists towards Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somehow related to the elections?
A spokesman for the Islamic Local Community said he was "profoundly shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which occurred just during the religious month of Ramadan, which is coming to an end.
Austria is seriously thinking about regaining its courage, following its swing to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that won almost 30 per cent of the votes, Freedom Party and Alliance for the Future of Austria, carried out an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, led his campaign against the wearing of headscarf and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad.
The courts banned glamorous rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he had expressed his intention to visit Spain through France to the authorities under his control.
The Kent Police had issued this travel ban last Thursday after proving Glitter's guilt for child sexual abuse to magistrates.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing in Ashford's limited court, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the court said "Thursday 25 September in Ashford court, Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr.Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there then."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even if he was registered on the list of sexual abuse defendants.
It must inform the authorities if they wish to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years' imprisonment.
Kent police stated that they would not discuss any particular cases or potential Glitter's movements in the contée.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said, "Kent police will do everything they can to protect our children like those abroad.
"In our view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have devices that can manage any potential risks, much more effectively.
"Protecting the people of Kent is the most expensive intention of the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, in order to minimize potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he should have boarded for a flight to London.
But he said he did not feel well, and refused to leave for London.
Thai authorities blocked him from passport control, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and was therefore forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on August 22nd and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge Court of limited jurisdiction, West London, to register him on the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been serving a four-month sentence in the UK for holding images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travelling in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the stage to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no gutsy clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where one discovers with intimate gestures and stolen looks artists who do not care to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of a few stages with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programme of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting passion, sadness, joy ... by enthralling the audience on stage.
To capture moments of personality of these artists, you do not have to make photos on stage.
They have their own personality and character.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera moments of personality of flamenco stars ".
With the festival "Chant populaire des Mines", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, reminisce classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises each day".
This is not about dancing or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the public with his art.
The search for essentials and magic has been the constant of this work that we present these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy artists photographed.
The project has been transformed into a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits de vieux sportifs" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a more or less long moment.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you don't know or that just leave you a few minutes to get a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the Galerie El Fotómata, located at number 20 of the rue de la Mata (rue parallel to the Peupleraie d'Hercule) which will be opened until 16 October next.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "real audacity"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he is working, a novel whose main character is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived for twenty years in Congo and who has passed through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize winner of Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay Segovia festival, that the novel that currently occupies him "is a real audacity" and that "everything shows that he should not write it".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people march through the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award with the majority of the participants' votes, made the hall full at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself faced with a fascinated audience who did not see the past hour during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and a great dose of humour, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote in a "very methodical way" thanks to an intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting part of the text to face his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Hispano-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is pure fun, a short-lived experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less alike" because writers were asked "not to let themselves go to frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather spoils the Pozoblanco fair
The banner festival that concluded the bulls races at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the toreadors on horseback had checked that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather was fierce at this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bull race planned.
In the poster, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have fought in the arena of Castilblanco
So only the Friday party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was carried in triumph, after making arm movements facing the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two bandrils planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the discovered stands applauded more than his fight in itself with the bull.
Worse still for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the audience.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five hours minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Euskadi police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Commune of Armín (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two begin the escape.
His load, more than two tons of hashish, enough to stop them.
The police officers prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to information disclosed by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident took place when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle check on the N-1, at the border of the Commune of Armin.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, abruptly accelerated and control began.
The police officers began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometres further on the side, where the two occupants went down to flee to a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hashish balls. Then they transferred it to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate had been “falsified” since it did not coincide with the one written on the car's grey card, which is also why they accused the detainee of falsifying documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old prisoner, A.A.J., was taken into custody to carry out the various steps and will be tried within the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear stopped for driving under the effect of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her do strange maneuvers trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to what a California police patrol spokesman revealed to People magazine.
The witness said that at around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "knocked hard on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going back several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who initially did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and exited his vehicle.
That person, at that time, called emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," which is why the agents took her to the drug and alcohol centre to carry out a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the beginning, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested being suspected of driving under the effect of a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated at approximately 19.00 hours and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat for a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the case Silva
The General Coordinator and Member of Parliament for the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Councillor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of carrying out preferential treatment for his family members.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares with regard to the behaviour of the political party that he will have to adopt in the Seville City Council.
However, the leader of the United Left called for investigations to show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva might have committed: "The United Left has always defended such cases so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all civil servants".
"Sangre de Mayo", the dared bet of Garci
Drawing on the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous Spanish battle against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros in budget.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" which he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film lasting more than two and a half hours, "Sangre de mayo" will be released in the cinema next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci assured himself that he had made with this film "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago to make a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2, Madrid, something he had always accepted when the story was based on national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain which was wrong leader for the fight, since, the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions during the reign of Ferdinand VII", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding as for the films "Captain Alatrist" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he could not shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated for almost his entire career.
The director of "Volver a empezar" influenced his usual way of working, on the staging of the actors, with whom he has the habit of repeating before starting the filming and to whom he does not cast, since it seems to him "humilizing" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and the cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" repeat in front of the camera, like Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times candidate for the Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de mayo", "Sept tables de billiard français" and finally the winner, "Les sunflowers blinds", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which deserves to be better known", he said.
With this movie Garci doesn't expect a price.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, and then you realize that you're working for prosperity, and now you're just making an extra movie," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón gets into the skin of the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillan dancer as well.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and a Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and who at the age of three will live in London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer specializing in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of the woman, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered me to perform the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me".
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of her dances made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" reminded me of a Cuban popular dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to hers," she says.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done at "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with the one who was his pupil.
"Matilde turns Tórtola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me."
The production was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rapo of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered to be divas".
This work also tells, in a certain way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in places so far away, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she was usually living in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think it is these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and highlights her work," says Bayón.
The show will start at 8:30 pm at the Lope Theatre in Vega
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a recently married Poet" in St Stephen's Church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress which took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This poplar of light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling to the various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a newly married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the best-known Andalusian poets.
America less likes without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them."
This phrase is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of malice", and illustrates well the despair of American cinema, and of all of America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer in this world.
He had trouble getting an Oscar.
He hasn't turned since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of its existence."
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerated.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly obscure period, when terrorists and stock markets were afraid, American esteem fell down, desperately seeking grounds for dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, human beings only have admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for drug fighting created in honour of his dead elder following an overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that struggled against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept away Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, the Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He set us the bar high," noted George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who tries to break through the screen as Paul Newman did: by being very honest and having a serious privacy and away from the goals.
It's still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there is one trying, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even though he did not miss the opportunities to not be.
"But why should I eat a burger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?", he used to joke.
In heaven, he attends with pride the encounter of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
"Among all the great roles he has performed, he has never been more proud than that of the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropist," he says.
Madrid in the race to organise the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organise Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst race I've ever competed in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of a elimination note.
But let's look at it in detail and from the beginning.
Mistakes begin with the removal of the dossards, which forces you to go ahead.
It's not bad, but if they make you move it would be better if they gave you everything (including the electronic chip for racing).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the bib (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small jerseys with less fabric and then cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the races.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible since 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions began and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the waiting of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and attacks took place from the barracks.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip that they gave me that, I think, didn't properly mark the start.
Of course, if they asked me to give an example of a perfect race, it would not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympic Games.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the conference on Emerging Technologies of Microsoft MIT was presented a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move on the company campus) in response to what was asked of him during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are, who they are - including remembering which positions they occupy - and listen to and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them into groups of conversation
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks him if she's here to visit someone and she tells him that she'll answer him in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked in addition to a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the necessary instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on Google’s part to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary as this is the basis for understanding computer hardware and software.
He holds the same position as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but we must see the "death" of the operational system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operational system but more and more to the Internet browser.
You turn on the computer only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
To whom do half of the applications provided with the system serve?
Who can do the least.
And Windows 7 will need to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, crowded months, less complex.
For now, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo in this article, was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them a lot.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso endorsed him on the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the holding of the association of muscular gays.
And if we begin to list all his apparitions, we could also mention this strong mustache who was lifting weights in a travelling circus.
It's not just a simple cotton, tight and sleeveless men's bodysuit.
The English call him 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others.
First of all, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel ' stands out from the others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag ( barely recognizable) that the most famous body jerseys have in their necks.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But she also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it's a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take very seriously their new activity in fashion.
According to Monica, they're not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion prizes that the Spanish company sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner of the Opera in honour of Valentino.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s enchants us and we take a lot of inspiration for our collections.
I like walking around town and watching women see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do it.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you're a very versatile woman: aren't you?
I think so, but in the end everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was very small I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look in my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers like to dress up very well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you put on the clothes, that's when you really get into the character's skin.
So, everything's connected.
You were not long 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30th birthday makes me happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl and it has given me a lot of internal happiness.
So, do you think you're a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me and, moreover, I want to become a young mom; I don't want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you're waiting for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
It's true, I can't wait for them to come out.
I'm a woman from the theater, I'm very impatient and worried, I'd like to have everything now but of course it's not possible.
I can't wait to get out the films 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo'.
To see what you'll think of it...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the bridge to make the model.
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for quite some time, to invite me to participate in a charity show in London for her association in support of women and the clothes we exhibit - I showed two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auction to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
People that Naomi is a person with a tender heart.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Besides, this so good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear tree, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the Third World.
Recidivists of alcohol driving will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcoholism to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting in a state of drunkenness, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and it now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last one year.
Its aim is to reintegrate the driver by offering him courses in road rehabilitation.
The Minister of State responsible for road safety but also the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Foundation Technological Institute for Motor Vehicle Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in a state of drunkenness, take over the car.
The alcolock would avoid this since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow forward; or when the alcohol level of the driver is higher than that authorized.
Its cost is over 1,000 euros and is at the driver's expense.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of offences in the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people every year.
This measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they turn into criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, however, reform by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system in school buses as was done in France.
Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5.40 p.m., the official scheduled time, the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of sunset but its rays still forced to put their hands as a visor so that the royal couple could get off the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I asked the taxi driver on the street if he was aware that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official journey.
- Ah, all right, so we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this hour... are you from here or...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking two years.
- Ah, all right...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military row composed of 27 naval soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when to her, has hair in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before going to the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they live, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny journalist from Mexican television awaits them.
The most prestigious fashion prize
There is certainly no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is certainly no more extraordinary and good living cartoonist than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talent.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in Mango's window at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost cried with emotion.
Certainly it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the competition, made that we found ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
With the table next to the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having fat on the heart and making against bad fortune good heart, because of the recent death of her brother, Nati put on a garment of Mango and a few adornments of ELAH, which cut the breath, and arm on, arm under, with her son Luis - a handsome man nearly two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in her honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as Baron de Rotchil finished the night without a jacket because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner metamorphosed by wearing a sexy and black long dress, moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the hall of ballet rehearsals and remembering the good old times, she grabbed one of the bars and she made the gesture of a 'big folded'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace's outbuildings, but she showed us before on her mobile phone pictures of her son.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another handsome man who travels on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked beforehand, that there should be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the number antistress
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of daily life.
And to top it all off, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the booksellers on September 30th.
The wake-up call almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it's even worse when you think of the restless rhythm that today's life imposes on us.
The office is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there is neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, neither one more nor one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to everyone's taste and time.
The antistress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at booksellers directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn't run in your veins to restore your body balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Speaking in sleep
Some children talk during the night.
I do not refer to those who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who talk during their sleep.
The first time this happens may surprise you, but in reality it doesn't matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquia.
This is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one who's talking at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often linked to other sleep alterations such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (pee in bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have already said, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stress or overexcitation.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, whispers or, on the contrary, with shouts, tears, long speeches ...
In the event that somniloquia becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another alteration of sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV shows that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who are struggling to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the sleeping pills appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if it is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not have the temptation to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because by sleeping, he's not conscious to be able to organize his thinking.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeeurn... finally.
Illhaeeurn finally found the way to victory on his field after a long period of famine.
Without making a big game, the Yellows and Blacks created the greatest number of opportunities and managed to transform one for the win of the game.
The pace was not very strong during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by visiting captain Kauffmann who was close to the skylight on a far shot, Illhaeusern would take slightly the ascending and in turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn above, Romain from the tip of the foot or Diebold came tickling the defense of Dannemarie.
On the other side, we were in the middle of the field and we just left the riahi stirring at the point of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to take back a ball pushed back on a first attempt by Diebold (53e').
But the Illhousian scorer will not be able to enjoy his happiness long and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose any big problems to an illhousian Eleven who just pushed back a little to "compact" his defense, except in the last few seconds of the game where, after a big crack, the ball passed very close to the transverse.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of strength of the fishermen who strongly disrupted the access of several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit which falls at the same time as a general assembly of the "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the rising prices of diesel oil, which reached a record at more than 1.14 euro per litre on average.
According to the spokesperson for lElysée David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams of nearly 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île not stopped.
A filtering dam has been set up on the Quiberon peninsula.
Sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, as demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to other ports of the Atlantic and Channel façade, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where trawlers have remained at the dock, or Le Havre, where some 20 boats have blocked the movements of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the Ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to be given to the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go" and "do not want to move to Paris", said Liliane Cariou, chair of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but they estimate that the profitability threshold of a boat is only reached with a diesel less than 0.30 euro per litre.
Paul Newman the beautiful
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes hailed the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is counting on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that are hovering over the world economy.
The fourth world aviation manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its deliveries forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer looks forward to the Chinese market especially for its aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which the US monetary authorities have bailed out, plans to divest more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the 85 billion dollars advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and its retirement activity in the United States, the newspaper which cites sources close to the file.
The Board of Directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to discuss possible divestments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG plans to separate include its subsidiary of International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% interest in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer, as well as its real estate portfolio and investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, continues the FT.
AIG must quickly realize liquidity to repay the loan of 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing the US authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting due to the current shareholders.
Analysis Paris Session History Morning Meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange claimed a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen near the 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dived from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technologically dominant Nasdaq index yielded 199.61 points at 1.983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (106.85 points) at 1.106.55 points, based on final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the sitting, Wall Street came down after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bank bailout plan, which was intended to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, representatives refused Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Almost two in three Republicans rejected his plan.
"This is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how important the market was in this regard," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would be "too late".
"If the project is indeed moribund (...) then the relay will be passed quickly to the Fed (the US central bank, ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, Chief Economist at Global Insight.
And accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, said Ms Piegza.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy on Friday, the authorities organized the takeover of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, pushing for emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets are facing "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis," added FTN Financial's analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of the 10-year-old Treasury Bill fell to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% on Friday night, and the 30-year-old's to 4.161%, compared with 4.357% the day before.
Obama, winner of the first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two White House candidates succeeded another to find out who, by John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honourable, has not been "bright enough" to stop him from dropping in the presidential polls to five weeks.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% in McCain), judges that it was the Democrat who drew his pin from the game.
Among undecided voters, who count, Obama came out victorious for 39% of those polled, while 25% of them gave McCain victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good performance expected of his parcelier, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's got good instincts," Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain has been constantly highlighting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while stressing his opponent's "naïvety" on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican TV commercials.
Obama pointed out that he represented the future.
Without disassembled, it was concise and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make the right decisions, and restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still has not understood, while Obama, if," replied, this weekend, a Democratic spot telling the Republican not to have taken full measure of the impact of the crisis on the "street American".
"During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people assembled for an election meeting in North Carolina in a beating rain.
He did not even say the words "medium class" or "workers."The financial defeat clearly advantage Obama, who is considered by the Americans as the most capable of saving the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"The coming week could be a decisive turning point," said the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final verdict of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that he would still be able to reduce taxes by 95 per cent of Americans despite the turmoil on Wall Street, the Illinois senator also pointed out that achieving the country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudent, the two candidates diddged questions about the $700 billion financial rescue plan (€470 billion) adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice there was an election?"
Young people and opponents protested on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to pre-empt the results of the legislative elections.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening as soon as the polling stations in central Minsk closed to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative process.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some admit they didn't even vote: "What's the point, because they'll do what they want with my voice," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has been good for foreign observers in order to resume language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turning point.
Sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the count," deplored Yuri Potemkin, the spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our country it is the executive power.
If opposition deputies enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for legislation."
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process may recognize the validity of the election.
She pointed out that participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalisation of advance voting (26% of voters in Minsk) had opened the vote to all manipulations.
"You noticed that there was an election, you?" asked social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five opposition deputies in parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls on the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its founding, and its president, Dr.Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, as Héma-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
Most importantly, he regained the public confidence that had been seriously shaken by the blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and the grunt of the public, in February 1994 the Government of Canada instituted a public inquiry, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations that such a disaster should not occur again.
While Justice Krever was slow to table his report, some provinces then set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Services to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began operations, just 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was disheartening.
As a result of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground in the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile."
Since its inception on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, there were many cases in Europe of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which has held the fort since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all whether this disease could be transmitted through blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports was that when it is not known and a serious disease can result, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration leading inevitably to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
As a result, in April 1999, blood was refused for people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, however, it was shown beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted through blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense."
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV testing technique emerged on the market: nucleic acid (NAT) tests, which directly detect the presence of the virus itself in the blood of donors and not the presence of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
The NATs made it possible to shorten the silent period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This has substantially reduced the risk that some donors will be infected without knowing it and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover our health," says the Chief Executive Officer of Hema-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than last year appeared on Reunion Island the Chikungunya virus which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," says Dr. Décary before pointing out that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient supplies.
"Needs are increasing because the population is aging.
Because anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need red blood cells or platelets to recharge.
The aging population also has an impact on the blood donor network, which averages only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
A healthy person aged 18 and over who meets the eligibility criteria can still give blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of people who offer their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a malaria-affected country, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But we need to renew the members of this donor network as they age and can no longer give blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give blood, but especially to hold them back and encourage them to become regular donors.
Since today's life is so unbridled, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eye globes and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is full of stem cell-rich blood that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to take more than a thousand a year.
We should start proposing some for transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr.Decary, who describes this cord blood program as very popular.
"Several mothers are disappointed to be unable to access it", because Héma-Québec cannot afford to offer this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - The Impact in the Semi-Final
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the U.S.L.'s first division playoffs, with a 3-1 (4-3 total goal) win over the Seattle Sounders yesterday in the second and decisive game of the quarter-finals in total goal at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half goalless on both sides, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other nets of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to defeat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that in the first round-trip game on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in the suburbs of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the 5-4 semifinal round in total goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In Brief - Victory Goal of Kovalev
The Canadian's number one trio is ready to begin the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 win by the Canadian at the barrage fire against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Habs in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to overdo it in the first period," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation."
Charest bets on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out calling elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party was finished, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, in Quebec City, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tried to be elected in today's by-election.
"Removing the boundaries of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest put forward with visual force while remaining broadly in line, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a sort of image mill.
On three huge screens, they were looping spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec as seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as in election times.
In the press, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would call the elections this fall, even though he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, simply explained why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but did not set a deadline, amount of investment, or specific priority in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be further developed: hydroelectricity, the forest, but especially the mining sector, boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it's our home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it home, but it is within us," he insisted, as if to show that he was soliciting a national founding myth.
Quebec has built up a lot in its relationship with the North, he pointed out: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister at the press briefing.
"This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government," he said.
On the other hand, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open all year round due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the people of the territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP of Ungava), have already begun consultations with some 30 communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be given".
Northern development would also be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal Prime Minister who preceded it.
"Like the Liberals before us, we thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a big cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename Centrale Beauharnois in Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Quiet Revolution and the Nationalization of Hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party was able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
In the press, he cited another reference, conservative one, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, premier from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydro-electric dam project, Mr.Charest noted that its commissioning was scheduled for 2012.
"It stays between us, but I plan to be there," he told his militants, causing them to be applauded.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling an election this fall, which the law allows him to do.
He pointed out, however, that his schedule was fulfilled, notably by a mission of the federation council to China and a Québec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that passed like a letter to the post office: the PLQ in particular calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and that they would have the right to veto decisions made in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the main lines of the Plan Nord were welcomed with scepticism.
The Pequist leader, Pauline Marois, emerged from the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, gave up its application.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today" commented Mrs. Marois alongside his candidate in Jean-Talon (scrutin which is taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ expressed support for the government's adoption of a North Plan.
"But what we want is not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is coming back from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (O Irony) in Harper's office, who allowed herself last summer to say to Louise Arbour that she was a "honest" for Canada.
To cast reproach on this woman who has waged an incessant fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as about Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government which is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its citizen locked up in the concentration camp of Guantánamo.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the charges against him.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing of the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier fall into inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
It should be remembered that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadr to enjoy a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not matter to him that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We do not yet realize this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that word that Harper is constantly brandishing and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
Here comes the time when no morals exist any more: one can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a minority head of government (what then after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made our country's reputation and dignity.
Shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this renunciation, not elsewhere.
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice President of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has brought a six million libel suit against three authors and a small publishing house without a penny in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation prosecutions, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
For, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to lead to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the publisher of Black Canada will have to spend considerable money to prepare their defence and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of mining.
The tactics, in these unequal struggles, are often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will gag the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who dares to look back at the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada normally take place through the exchange of ideas and not with batons.
It was therefore enough for mining to open its books, its files and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support to Black Canada authors.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could both ask for a "public" debate while ignoring the views of the same public?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers only to fatly paid lawyers, not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even critics have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public that supports Black Canada's authors and publishers does so primarily because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is prepared to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a gag chase (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has also just filed a warning against Black Canada authors intimidating them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's surreal discourse, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on academic freedom of research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, as a whole, the right to the citation of credible sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss issues that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, or if there are no repeated prosecutions, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by Black Canada authors.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has a long history of managing debates and disagreements and resolving conflicts.
The disproportionate pursuit of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss to the academic world, as well as to public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit this kind of abuse.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been rocking Wall Street for months still needs to be endorsed by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for default, and a right of scrutiny of the salaries paid to the managers of the companies rescued.
The U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and disruptions on the daily lives of Americans will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned into a sprint in the last few hours for fear of the effect that a new failure would have on investors' mood.
The deadline was for the opening of the markets this morning.
Lately associated with the negotiations, the two candidates in the US presidential election were rather in favour of the agreement, but they did not fail to express their dissatisfaction that it was necessary to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has attributed the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including the agreement to allow owners to keep their homes and the agreement on the salaries of the executives of companies that have been rescued by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be welcomed.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
Asked on another channel to find out if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The broad lines I have read [show] that this is something we are all going to have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers' money the bad, risky and unsaleable debts of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble which first led to the collapse of risk mortgages (subprimes) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and leading to a freezing of liquidity and the debandade of banks and financial institutions.
It's a group of elected Republicans who blew the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed that this impasse has been overcome since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round off the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision has also been added stating that if the government were to bear losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion, to which the President may add another 100 billion if he deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion is expected to be approved by another Congressional vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will obtain shares in the rescued companies that will earn him dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to resell when the turmoil passes.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure procedures for housing related to the real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on the remuneration and severance payments paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and to that of the Senate Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
In fact, voices continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democrat camp.
"Obviously, Washington can't hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, to his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one which consists of profiting the taxpayers".
Moderator of a small group in Congress, nicknamed "the caucus of skeptics", Democratic representative Brad Sherman presented things differently, but came to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to tell us: Congress is asked not to rush and to look carefully at the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again proof of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas had indicated that it had renounced to acquire its competitor in full shipwreck since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"It's not lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In return, we get back a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that savers and households now appreciate that the times are uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed on the way to nationalising another bank misled by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (US 75.5 billion) would be real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and accounts receivable of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty in the eyes of azure was for a long time his asset card, some will say his weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent flowing from the source will also have removed him from the power register that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared Friday, at the age of 83, as a result of lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fastes years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of which he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the bursting of dramatic conventions.
The mixed bloods often make beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, the ultimate brand of quality.
Because in him there was a whole country that loved the self-made man, the Pacific War fighter, wounded in combat, who at the beginning of the 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theatre, on television, soon in cinema.
The same man who militated for civil rights was also the motor driver who finished second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, coupled with a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the shadow zones of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to the brilliance of the show-business, of which we will not have completely pierced the enigma.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's disappearance brought vertigo to the movies this weekend, as his big roles clashed on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation unfolds through it.
Return to memory of the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a burning roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises, was evoked.
So many other Paul Newmans have come to history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, taken over after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This nice thug in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and avenger in the magnificent Robert Rossen's The Hustler (1961), he took over the character on the return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar in 1987 on nine nominations.
That face through the ages was him.
He's still here.
The eras rushed through his path.
Young people know him mostly through George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977) in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as sponsor of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
In contrast to several legends of the cinema that left the trade early on, Newman will have remained in saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its fastes and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humour, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" considering his performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the handsome Paul Newman to whom the roles long fell all cooked in the beak.
However, he played less often the young first than the marginals: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose perfect features reflected drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed little known facets of his true modest sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine feminine portrait of melancholy.
He lost his son Scott by overdose and dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the rains of tributes that broke out yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former arms companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generousness, love of existence are vibrant features of the disappeared actor.
Beyond his career as a legend, he also erases a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of Hollywood drifts.
We've seen a lot of his dick standing on vinaigrette pots, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process to be rather bad taste, though gag at first.
However, the profits from these sales were paid to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than sit on his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in sum and in addition.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company make in their invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, resulting in particularly serious damage. Other charges have been brought against them, such as, for example, forgery and the use of forgery.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the state and the municipalities, about HUF 65 million in total, went on the one hand in the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, which was also made public by the investigating authorities, was to receive the money from the subsidies obtained by issuing bills of fees, behind which no actual services were provided and thus the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they bought invoice books from the Józsefváros market, while they made the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to his testimony, he had to spot pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices that they would introduce, among others, from the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András
During a "tracking circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlags in 2003, this place restored a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up in the name of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which will later be named Együtt to Harmadik Evezredért, was gruelling with faults of form and substance.
A boarding house, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and up to ten people could spend the night there. However, the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty guests.
Imagining bill issuers also fell into excess, when they mentioned Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither the name of Jobb Jövőért nor that of Hoppá appeared, according to the information given to the prosecutor's office.
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, told the website hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that they were false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the bill, a hundred people have lodged there, also did not stick, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much room.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of zealous invoices also did not ask themselves about the Budapest travel agencies, which were part of their choice, but organized only trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
From a surprise, as it appeared during the survey, they also added VAT on these documents, while services relating to travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices issued in the name of the Hotel Revfülöp to the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's services do not bear a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT. Moreover, the employees of the hotel issue only printed invoices, while the fakes were written by hand.
The prosecution's investigation reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes by mentioning as a supply the carriage of goods by road, which the company issuing the invoices could not exercise, since its profile was the investment consultancy.
Moreover, it is also for defects of form, such as inadequate types of invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued to the order of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proved to be false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó sports training course, which both deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
Nor did the counterfeiters pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., based in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation when (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have a meal at home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company denies having issued this invoice.
Invoices deliberately established
Another category of invoice issuers is that composed of those who were fully aware that they were asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esely Budapestert Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the group of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, has established an invoice to the order of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, it cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, Atlasz Egyesület Association and Vörösfenyő Egyesület Association, for an amount of approximately HUF 5 million, but behind which no services were actually provided.
No financial movement took place, either, as the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this was avoided by the organizations in their accounts.
The next category of invoice companies is that of companies directly related to the accused.
For example, the executive director of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where it could not be found, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of the company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Iván Kubatov also allegedly sent documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he seized their value.
It was precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian masons created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies functioned, which the accused explains because they did not receive work.
He nevertheless used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-defendant as well as editor of the founding documents of the companies, he drew up invoices in their names, to the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Kubatov gave agencies, 15 invoices in total, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecution believed that 10% of the amounts shown on the invoices as well as VAT went in Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictitious invoices that were used in the application for a grant from Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért Association applied to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA) for a grant from the public utility body of the Socialist Party.
They obtained this grant for a sum of HUF 500,000 twice, but these amounts were not used for the objectives indicated in the application.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search in the office of Árpád Kemecsei, Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants will report on the method of making invoices, as they had already done before the prosecution.
What might be really interesting is that the main defendant, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on the whole story.
So far, his confession is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or, possibly, the Socialists would have reached an agreement that, in exchange for the repayment of much of the HUF 50 million, Zusi would bear the hat alone.
Today, he is probably offended, as requests for house arrest, on the basis of a reduction in his conditions of detention, continually fall into the ears of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and those who commit unreparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, wait at their own home for the end of the proceedings. He does not have this possibility.
The psychology of the overbid: why are we spending more money?
During auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the merchandise.
Neurology and economics researchers at the University of New York have been able to update the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced during this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
This research attempted to draw up a neurological scheme of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group took part in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) process, researchers analyzed the active brain domains of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, one essential element of which is the over-biding of a third party, the whole under the brain stem, called striatum, was moving intensively when the game was lost.
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
This is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight in front of the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers continued financial surveillance analyses.
At the time, three groups were overbiding by a partner, under various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they thus made their investments.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they would win the game, then they would receive an additional $15, as a reward.
While the third group received the $15 before the auction, the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was placed in one group on victory, while in the other, on failure.
By thus proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team of players "against failure" were willing to wager higher than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by now leading to a third explanation." - noted Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When do we need to see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is mentioned as one of the leading causes of death.
Patients with hepatitis virus in Hungary are estimated at one hundred miles, but only seven miles are being treated. This is due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogenic genes, are mainly spread in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is recommended that they be vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no C vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating contaminated foods, usually accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach aches and nausea.
Then develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible jaundice, the stool becomes lighter and the urine takes a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Every year around the world, one million people die of the most serious form of this disease, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients is receiving medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know of the virus, because the pathogenic gene destroys the liver cells in a sneaky way. In many cases, the first symptoms do not appear until after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion prior to 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic type C hepatitis worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult with your treating physician as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does the one who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a sort of analgesic, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph has published an article according to which researchers at Oxford University have made an interesting experiment by analysing at what level belief in God could influence tolerance to human pain.
As part of this bizarre experiment, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also possible to discover that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments, in which academicians, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experiment takes place as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and diffusing the electroshocks is attached to the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to watch two paintings in a sustained way, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the ermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experiment hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary evoked a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, concerned its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time received 20 electroshocks in four parts succeeding, while looking either at the religious theme painting or the more general theme painting.
The Catholics said that, in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "safe", as someone "cared for" and they "calmed, and peace invaded them".
In view of the painting of religious theme, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, thinks that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in atheists, provided that we find the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image to which they react very positively, like, for example, a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, praised the results of this research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases actually changes our personality," added Wright.
After these excellent results, only the question remains of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of subjects if one shows believers a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same calibre?
Would the sight of a better Virgin Mary produce better results?
You're what you disclose about yourself.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says that it can be found in the bottom of people's pocket in the same way as the sky above their head. It knows where they spent their holidays, which specialists they consult and what their interests are.
Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in society, says that it is not yet enough.
While as far as skeptics are concerned, establishing a parallel with Orwell's vision of horror, they do not see the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary for the founders of Google to meet their original goal, which sounded as follows: "Let's get back into a system all the information in the world!".
According to the Google leader interviewed, after ten years of global shattering, they are still only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
To the question: what will happen in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What would be the best job for me?". However, the software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first sight, when they know enough about the users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer launching the search, and the pages consulted by the interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they've been looking for, on which they clicked. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services to us based on our previous statements and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what my job is? ask users, who are worried about Google's monopoly of information.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can generate fear, and it is not the remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or possibly revolt against power that can trigger a counter-reaction among Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the terms sought are not only registered, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing an identification.
Human rights-conscious Internet users may have sighed for relief last May, when Google, with EFF's e-legal protection agency, proved its right in court against the FBI. According to the judgment rendered, in the future, Google will still not be forced by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information about the FBI's secret request of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, passed several years earlier. But in the end, it fails to get the lists of searches of private users, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is castigated by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer from it when they begin to use Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against multinational companies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "savageons" bringing together enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic computer users who appear in many countries see Google as the next generation of big companies, the "connected corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as an invader of the world because of Windows, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The document code and package of programs, continually refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, compared to the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what web 2.0, the most proclaimed key word of recent years, is pulling right behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 does not concern anything other than collaboration, than the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the channels of communication made available to us, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other performances, such as Twinter, or last.fm, which is a link to his musical habits. Then, he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, in which they automatically appear their most recent photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can see many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands from the pictures of the morning, taken by the circle of friends who shared, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company that fired one of his employees, just for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management, we can be sure of one thing: the term of privacy is totally to be reconsidered nowadays.
He who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and that is how we can define the principle hiding behind the behaviour of today's young people.
Whoever wants to hide something, or at least wants to try to bypass Google's monopoly, can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using Google's search system, but at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them is not the least. Google’s online services, through word processing to image processing and reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge server parks and which do not assemble our best profile, which have existed to date.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its present value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising fields threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the services introduced at an increasing speed cause serious migraines not only to Microsoft, but to many other creators of computer programs.
However, critical observers find contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the company's top management refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it doubled the price of the kindergarten and after the company deemed the daily multiple catering, taken at any time, too expensive. All this seems ridiculous in addition to the fact that already in 2006, Google acquiesced before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that injure the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, the new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is sure is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that Google's project of scanning and archiving books and magazines takes on such important dimensions that the company will soon find itself facing the Supreme Court of the United States, others are shaking in front of its Health system, because in it, we can build a complete medical profit from our results of previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google is setting up a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel by the famous Cory Doctorow, written with orwellian half-tones, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a frightening way just through Google's data.
Two minors helped remove traces of Ózd's double homicide
"The police summoned two minors to question them in the case of the double homicide of Ózd. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped to remove the traces of the crime." - said the spokesman of the police department of Borsod.
The young people have acknowledged the charges against them, and for the moment they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraphic Agency) are young girls, defend themselves free.
Abetting murder can result in detention of up to five years.
The suspect of Ózd's double homicide, a 23-year-old local man, was remanded in custody on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and out of interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a large amount of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt, and for this reason he attracted his creditor last Wednesday to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as this 9-year-old man's little daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man premeditated his crime, and the weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the scene of the crime is proof.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the takeover of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish have made despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wants to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer made so far for the acquisition of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the Stock Exchange in New York, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated to be between 5 and 10 billion Czech kroner by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is Patria Finance, with about 25 per cent stakes, followed by the 14.7 per cent of the Ceská Sporitelna bank and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their Tuesday comments on the international financial crisis, which is getting worse from day to day, the leading newspapers in the European press are already talking about a "second 11 September".
"The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president" - accuses the daily newspaper of Rome, La Repubblica. "The president was not even able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised at the quick end, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as mentioned by billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to speak of a second September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the shortcomings of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is increasing every day, and then the whole world is going to pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the Congress vote, a real threat, that Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in a vacuum, just at a time when in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer - points out the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states can still extend a lifebuoy to their titular financial organizations, and thanks to their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need the states of the European Union to ignore little of their national selfishness, and to centralise control over divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than EUR 100 billion - recalled the Viennese daily newspaper, Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers too will have to put their hands in a very deep pocket, similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, is going through the old continent on its own.
The "savers" should not immediately wave a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they noted in what case it would be rational to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
Smart car mimics bourdon theft
What method would be better to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, other than the imitation of an obstacle detector already existing in nature?
Like, for example, bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, held in Japan, the buzzing bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic idea of starting, to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired auto-roboted system, type BR23C, which it has equipped with the qualities of bees, the ultimate objective being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
On its flights, each bee constitutes its own oval-shaped space, which in fact looks very much like our secure protective hull - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the technological research and development and public relations department of the brand.
The faceted eye of the bee plays a crucial role, since it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the faceted eye, engineers approached the idea of a laser ranger.
It identifies obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, evaluates distances and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which turns it into an avoidance manoeuvre immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it with a sufficient angle to avoid the collision.
Unlike any existing system, this avoidance manoeuvre is entirely instinctive.
"If this were not the case, the mini robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment collision is considered inevitable.
All this process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in the blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees possess to avoid other bees, in our case, we were able to use only the rotary motion, acceleration and slowing down as manoeuvres at the disposal of the mini robot
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a greater concentration of energy, making their lifetime longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, instinctive intelligent reaction is paramount, not data processing, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism must deal with only a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
We don't need memory of gigabytes, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards the design of an instant-avoidance technology. Nissan estimates that this system will enter mass-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
We even gave a name to the cheap baby.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, aimed at redeeming banks' doubtful credit and using it in multiple ways, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that in the course of further debates lasting until after midnight, Saturday, local time on the east coast, the leaders of Congress have agreed on the controversies existing for days and days, around the rescue plan for a total amount of $700 billion.
"We have taken a serious step forward" - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, according to which the only thing left is to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, commented on the outcome of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. Pelosi says that there is no question here of saving Wall Street, but of turning the machinery of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8 p.m., local time in Washington (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to local time in Central Europe), but did not cause a dramatic rise in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill in the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Then, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress achieved tonight, and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
In addition, the program diverges from the Bush administration's original proposal, which stated that the $700 billion had to be spent on a one-time basis, for the purchase of securities for doubtful credits.
From now on, up to half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first $250 billion will be issued immediately after Congress passes the law, probably on Monday. This first amount will be used by the Treasury Secretary to purchase bad debts from banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The program will be overseen by an independent organization, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress.
According to the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to put in place a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase bad debts, securities relating to bad mortgages and bad mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" debts.
The appropriate persons in the department have stated that buybacks may take place in the context of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance programme, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools at the root of the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to spend $700 billion for the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast redemption of doubtful claims, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system leading to the collapse of one or the other important financial institution.
"We will make the necessary arrangements, to be ready for the application of the law, as soon as it is signed" - he added.
On the other hand, the leaders of banks in poor positions and waiting for state aid can expect their severance pay, simply called the gold parachute across the Atlantic, to be capped by the government.
Wage limits are mentioned only in specific cases, and limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat provides assistance to the company.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys back in an auction, they will levy a surplus tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the redemption of the bad debts, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not exaggerated.
In order for the image to be complete, it must nevertheless be added that the existing golden parachutes are not changed. The cap only concerns new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in place on the back-up of directors general - commented the chairman of the committee in charge of financial services of the Chamber of Deputies, the Democratic Barney Frank.
In addition, the state acquires a right to acquire shares in the banks taking part in the plan. In this way, the risk of taxpayers diminishes, since they can even win in the case as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks will fall on their feet.
The bill mentions that in the next five years, the President must bring a proposal to Congress that will decide how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That's not why American citizens mandated us, it doesn't protect taxpayers' dollars - said California's Republican MP Darrell Issa.
His fellow Ohio Democrat, Mary Kaptur, believes that it is the same people who are urging action, as those responsible for the Wall Street collapse.

Prices for paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry saw an increase, ranging from 0.2 to 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which account for a significant share of domestic industrial operations, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly because of the rise in gas prices introduced by the authorities since 1 July.

Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that by 12 January, the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force. This is what the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "now everything depends only on when the electronic input and control systems across the Atlantic will be put into operation."
However, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will present the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign political advisers of the presidential candidates, the Democratic Barack Obama and the Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank bailout plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, along with John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, assured their support for the $700 billion government's bailout plan. However, there are politicians who are demanding the resignation of the US Treasury Secretary.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, Congress representatives and the Administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they had reached agreements in principle on the bailout plan for banks.
This financing plan, which aims to thaw the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain present themselves, each as more capable than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has again managed to get a little ahead. McCain’s advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a parceler just after the Republican convention, has melted.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the 700 billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he too supports.
"It is now necessary to act with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to describe McCain's economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We'll all have trouble swallowing it... but doing nothing is not a possible way."
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal referred to the creation of a Treasury Control Commission and the cap on senior officials' severance benefits, and that he was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Secretary of the Treasury.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will pass the bill as early as Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - as the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, points out.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this recognized political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took up his duties.
The Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This time change is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but Sunday came to a conclusion a process that was likely just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU picked up with 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the elections of the Bundestag in 2005, that is to say at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "depriving her parents", implemented in the region in a consistent manner by the CSU.
Sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong about the pace. However secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans from the north and east in the region of Bavaria, in full development, could not be without consequences on the faithfulness of the CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have moved rather away from the CSU, such as the independents, the artisans, the holders of the baccalaureate and the graduates of higher education.
In these groups, support for CSU declined below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who ? With whom ? Party presidents stand on the reserve in the face of coalition issues", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the confused domestic politics that took place after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian SPÖ Socialists wish to discuss this with the conservatives of the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering with its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations, and the Greens still do not want to agree on the coalition.
The elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates held on public television, party leaders have barely let their cards glimpse.
Werner Faymann, SPÖ president, confirmed that he wanted to discuss the matter with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as Vice-Chancellor, remains open from Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer approach was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the reds.
As he has already said, collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is momentarily a very open question, and these points must be debated within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, President of the BZÖ, is once again open to proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities" - said Haider.
Járóka said: The vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokesmen of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is a violation of the law that most affects Roma children and thus one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of deputy Fidesz Parti Populaire, Járóka warned that, in addition to the distinctions made during the hirings, Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualifications.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school diplomas, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a tiny part has the possibility of obtaining a higher education diploma."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in upholding other fundamental rights.
Investment in the early education of Roma children means strengthening the economies of EU member countries.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in the broadest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma child starts school, the more likely he or she is to become a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his or her income and consumption, he or she participates in the State budget.
"By virtue of their citizenship of the European Union, Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education and be protected from low quality and sectarian education." - stressed Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, collaboration by the European Union towards an objective and action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools. To this end, compliance with existing and in preparation anti-discrimination directives is of paramount importance.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and the unemployed; we must give the opportunities provided by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe" - demanded Járóka.
In the name of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities" for all, the objective of the Summit for Equal Opportunities in Europe, organised every year since the Berlin Summit last year, is to ensure a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination, targeted at European level and at Member State level.
CSU: grace for a transition period
The decision on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be taken in October.
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been adjourned.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still hold their place. The question is how long will the grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of voice, will be on the agenda of the exceptional party congress held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair, in any case, felt that they were not particularly interested in their seats.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the furious members of the fraction and base, who one day after the "Bavarian Tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "single sovereign" of Bavaria, giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But conservatives still have a strong stake in this southern region, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced to join the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganisation of the party, the vice-president and the federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as Huber's possible successor, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates discussions with the liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Munich government.
A strange nose of destiny has been that with the help of the list of Free Electors, enters into the legislation Gabriele Pauli, whose taking of action against Stroiber has served as a putsch possibility perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, and then treat without care the very ambitious municipal political woman.
Now, CSU leaders are putting all their energy to stabilize, one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far was pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also be given an active role. The former head of regional government and former president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some sharp remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections to be held in September 2009, Merkel can only be a chancellor once again if they re-establish in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hiding his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not negatively influence the great Berlin coalition.
What is relative, however, is that it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the socio-democrats still persists.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 per cent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals : 110 - 0
No opposition MP joined the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due to illegalities committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-person legislature in this country of 10 million inhabitants has been very well opposed for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time in questionable elections, in the footsteps of the amendment of the constitution in 2006, would allow this time the presence of a few opposition deputies in parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ renounced its original boycott.
The fact that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where due to the Belarusian political order described as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive an entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take credit because of the decrease in imports of Russian natural gas, which is increasingly expensive, and thus contributed to the passage of the company Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipelines crossing the country, has passed into the hands of the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, during the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive rather than non-compliance changes, such as the ban on standing for one third of opposition candidates, referred to prior appeasement.
However, the OSCE statement on Monday was already challenging the campaign, during which most opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present during the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political detainees have regained their freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia. However, Russia with which Belarus forms a paper confederation, considers the two independent territories for already a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has begun between Belarus and the EU" - said Alexandre Milinkevich to our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this should remain so, despite the fact that "the power was afraid in this parliament that has no weight, to bring in even one opponent".
The opposition does not foresee any protest actions in view of the results; rather, it tries to send its message on the need for economic reforms to voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we have to have our opposition newspapers printed in Russia, local authorities are putting us sticks in the wheels for broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly" - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the most officially supported pensioner layer no longer really considers it appropriate.
"Because of the country's debt and the rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time," says Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds." In this way, the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, did not have rotating doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from now on, this new measure is in effect against the clever little ones, against whom points and then goes to drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-fouling novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors," Brunetta says, "are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services," said the minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
"It's reformism," Brunetta says.
The installation in all the establishments of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of the employees has been recorded, says the secretary general: "it is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Promise of Brunetta, which suggests in smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 am is an excellent and safe resolution".
At a conference at the Ecole Supérieure de l'Administration publique
"In three months, the absences of public employees from sickness reduced by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand more workers in one year".
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more efficient.
Italian, " whose wage dynamics- explains the minister- over the last 8-10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and well in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined forces to challenge the standards of the Brunetta Decree making use of Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service today spreads the data concerning the decrease of absenteeism in the workplace due to illness- writes the consumer association- the people of the "active lazy" continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of employees of the correct and productive Public Administration, have come together to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of infirmity on the basis of service is contested; the extension of the hours of residence of the sick worker, during which the checks are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Accidents at the workplace, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, the Inail data confirm that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and cause almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To get the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all the Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Workers' Accident Victims, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the president of Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Invalids of Labour, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the ongoing effort to promote prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and awareness-raising among the public"
"naturally indignant, everyone has punched in order to put an end to such tragedies which, by their size, provoke the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector, are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed how "this phenomenon of the white dead constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all the institutions, to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The accident data on the work seems to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent that the number of white deaths is still impressive," stressed later the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not wish that this "trend to the discount" actually translates into a minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention relaxes, that the tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be achieved through multiple actions."
"According to us- Mercandelli- more checks and inspections are needed, as is a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school."
- He added that "an additional effort must be made with regard to communication and public awareness.
"But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Mercandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for the victims of labour" and the "scheme of assistance towards which the system has been oriented in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to give back to the worker the guarantee of insurance – he added – so that the fate of the person who has an accident, should not depend on spontaneism or the enlargement of the legislator"
Mp3 reader pointed at their finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission, which, in a press release in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee on unforeseen and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) published today.
"of this scientific report- we read in the note- it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music at full volume using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per day per week, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and mobile phones at full volume may unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to the scientific data- continues the manager Ue- this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What is most important is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can monitor new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"The scientists-concluded the executive Ue- confirm that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties, what possible measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents against exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100Db, but there is increasing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit these data well using solutions such as reduction of noise levels and duration of exposure.
The Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits on the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for extended periods of time are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified in about 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to send the Commission away for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we finish, in June we will pull the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning at the new headquarters behind the Caracalla Baths.
In six months' time, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will finalize the directives for Rome.
In March, when they have finished, the Committee and the Communal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so as to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
" "The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there- would like to stress Alemanno- it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome which can be used by political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Communal Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to draw up a great project for Rome.
In March, she will finish her tasks and then disappear, as this experience must have a precise time-frame.
In June-announce the mayor- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale."
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replied: "It depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as elsewhere in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the day-to-day management and emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to see forward, and further, towards a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman city dwellers, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "it requires a draft strategic reference, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city, to improve itself, what it absolutely needs, while thinking of its future now a unitary spirit,".
A future which, says the Mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but will look further" not only in view of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but" also in relation to the role that Rome can and should have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to be independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as he always has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition".
Obama is really stunned: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these are attacks that do not say much; these are obviously attacks of a racial nature, and do not answer the question of all the voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all declare that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississipi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the polling booth, we know who the American patriot will give his vote to.
Now there emerges an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
"Tell us what you want, we'll see ourselves put the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed so far, so much so that the black candidate's success seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was kicked home to the buttocks.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's point of weakness.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
Usa, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for abolitions. And many accuse the Internet, this "killer" of newsprint.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to the information attachés, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors are working on the assembly of newspapers, are a big problem.
According to the journalists interviewed, this is a problem that needs to be resolved if traditional journalism as the general public hears it is not to be reduced significantly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and newspaper journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a bad path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists don't have a hard time seeing where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses are looking at the Internet, perceived by many as "the murderer" of the newspaper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to putting themselves to technology hoping that it "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest clinch in American journalism lies between who heads the newsrooms--that is, the directors-- and reporters who work for them.
56% of managers at national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at local level this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to the "safety of work".
Directors who think they lose their jobs in the space of 3 years, are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we're going at 30%.
That of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always receive high salaries, while the editor can earn $10 thousand a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in total, spent a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "bad" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTE A GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal division of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the proceedings of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl climbing instruction.
At the time of the prosecution's trial last week, he had obtained the release of his house into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to travel from the provincial town to a home in the capital.
According to the court, such displacement (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his society and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the House of Representatives voting, contrary to the 700 billion dollar bailout plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms to us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its moderate soul East Coast, favorable to federal institutions as well as to business community, and its new soul, conservative, hostile to "the ones of Washington" and the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and Southern States.
The soul, precisely, which was despotically felt with the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, what has just been cited is only an example of the changes, of the great changes that the current economic earthquake pre-announces or already leaves running: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and can be not just here.
In both the United States and Europe, the crisis seems to have accelerated the phenomena that have arisen for some time now, so much so that, in the new climate, they are solidifying and revealing themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the updating, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category State-sovereign, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with the foreigner, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families who live in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for whom it is governed: that is to say, to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically, it is almost only here national.
Political internationalisation really seems out of hand, or it does not have much to say: the obvious proof is provided to us by the European Union, which, as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, manages to decide no common political lines.
And so, it is from the government of each state that all expect interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a affection of credit: when we go through a difficult period, there are only the states that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements that no market or international organization can ever dispose of in a similar way.
This new emphasis on the nation-state crisis is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-important importance that the more recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, indeed, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized from a single stroke, that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with things that are not material enough such as water, crops, oil.
Things which can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a confined space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty, which nevertheless foresees a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who can take control of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadowy areas.
And moreover, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: discredit, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number of Western countries.
Thus increases even more the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their apogee, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of the majorities.
In short, The demand for leadership, nourishes underground, a powerful and branched movement of delegitimassions of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised electoral "rebellions" or in the collective changes of recent times, starting from the conservative rise in Austria Bavaria, the fall of the Labourers in Great Britain, the rebellion of the American Congressists against Bush (and it might well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not happen by chance).
It seems that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, would say someone, have ever more difficulty, which is not today's date, in understanding and thus representing the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is strengthening, increasing and potentially agitating in a disproportionate way.
In view of all this, talking about a current "mass rebellion" on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But it is said well, keeping your eyes wide open is not without reason.
The superglue to walk on the walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers managed to hold a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
ETUDE- The American journal Science published the findings of researchers from Dayton University, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a stack of spaghetti." Explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have drawn inspiration from the legs of the geckos, covered in microscopic hairs that ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time that it "is easily detached from the wall", explains Liming Dai, researcher of the Faculty of Engineering at Dayton University.
MARKETING ON MURSE? –"this material could be used as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers are thinking of a much less fascinating use such as connection between electronic devices, since nano carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications may include aerospace engineering.
For now, no superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, Californian researchers presented an adhesive made of microfibres like hair, which cleans dust during movement on an area to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medicines: never with fruit juices.
Be careful with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in the summer because they are detoxifying and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital medicines, alter the absorption amplifying or decreasing, depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of juices, whether in cans or fresh, associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, cancelling their beneficial effects and putting patients at risk.
Grapefruit juice has already been strongly criticized as being responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-statinal and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
MEDICINAL PRODUCTS - It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which gave the news in a two-year newsletter, alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mix and to pay attention to what they drink, if they take medicines such as, for example, Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT THAT PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the Public University of Milan: "These discoveries are generally reported immediately to the various national and international drug agencies that will have to change the information notes of the medicines if necessary.
It is always appropriate to read the illustrative papers of the medicines you are taking, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," stressed the expert to the Ansa agency.
Paul Krugman's Nobel Prize in Economics.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote in an article on the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A forecast that unleashed many controversies, and which was blamed on the economist for years, but which has now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist" but also a very aggressive "disclosure", particularly critical of the Bush administration's excesses of liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open suite source of personal productivity that aims to reach always and even more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of almost a year, carried out by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package shows itself to the general public with various novelties: from the welcome screen, and the interface reviewed and become less austere, to others more important, such as the compatibility born for the operating system Apple Mac OS X, and the support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Open Office paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, certain functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphic development module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Still on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that link the typical Adobe chart to the elements of a spreadsheet or text maker.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the modifications, in the drafting of texts, because to each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they are expected to deliver the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is added to the English version which has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation cd can be shipped home or to the workplace.
And while the theme of free can be a way to disseminate it in homes, it is precisely in business, that Open Office tries the great challenge, already able to rely on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a service of training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the equivalent writing video of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the rival PowerPoint presentations;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows to work on the databases; finally Drwa is the graphics module.
Target for 2008, reaching 5 million download, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, one can even exceed the figure expected
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
It is the website of the daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
At the age of 26, Kohl was the fourth positive cyclist at the Cera, the third generation Epo, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
Blood tests carried out on Kohl test pieces have been part of those carried out in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity of the Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian was on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, thus picking up the polka dot jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES QUESTIONS IF ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as an Emigrant Country has recently turned into a preferred destination for immigrants" welcomed reluctantly.
Would this turn the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is interested in, which dedicated a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "Northern Paradox": the Nordic regions are both those where "more integration and more work" are registered, but also "an anti-immigrant feeling the strongest in the country and the most important support for the Northern Lega"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also referred to episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Even the Lega's new legislature to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as proof of the changing climate in Italy.
Tendency emphasized by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI in the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Student victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market does not experience a crisis
According to the last survey of the Sunia, the tenant union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding whole categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin must support- explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the high demand from students has distorted the market so much that a process of widespread increase has even begun for residents.
In most cases, there are also a number of violations in the rental offers: free, unregistered, rent-free contracts, sub-leases.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of tax taxation are necessary to calm prices.
Read in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, it ranges from 650 euros minimum (Band Nere area), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, an average bed costs 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and from 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are required for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (€550 for a single) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you move away in the peripheral areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a single in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one, we spend from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, you have to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by extra-Community students, there is a further anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, the cities elect the historic halls.
Historical cinemas close in favour of the Multiplexes.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image presented by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centres, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalisation of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of large multi-salles, and the death of the consumption of mono-salles in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems inescapable and indisputable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historic places and filled with memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a bit of a path and so much emotion," observes the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, film that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, and that told the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia of a way to live cinema, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of traders, mean everything: over the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and it is the halls of the main cities that have mainly paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the areas most affected by the closure, Romaine Emilia is in the lead with 82 single theatre cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The proof which confirms that the first person responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-salle cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy over the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," observed Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a firm hall in a city, these frequentors are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the missed deliberation of credit in favour of traders: the state's antecedent debt is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government is not complying with existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between €16 million and €18 million per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, worried about these closures, decided to resolve the situation thanks to the signing of a protocol between Town Hall and Anec, the first of this kind in Italy, to defend and promote the single cinemas of the historic centres and on the outskirts.
Among the normative measures envisaged are measures of fiscal facilities for managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted area, and will have special rates for parking and in certain parking lots.
"This is an initiative that I like," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna with other measures in place.
It is clear, however, that to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New cinema Paradiso" to which I had already thought for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, I turn on the other side so that I do not see the signs darkened by the dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta’, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the City Hall's choices to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
heavy charges are laid by the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, against the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for Mafia association.
The controls also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous with the boss, already convicted for association of mafia-type criminals, as well as paying 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all common sense," wrote the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay for consultations with Master Piromalli.
"So it would have been granted to the clan - writes the judges - to officially enter the town halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and orientation of the public administration"
The chairman of the Calabrais regional committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide only "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the indrangheta, heroes who are honest"
This morning's arrests follow those of July, after which the police announced that the Piromalli clan had been beheaded.
By the end of last April, the communal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still because of the alleged conditioning between organized crime and local government, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, was appointed leader of a centre-right coalition, after the ballot in May 2006.
He shouted at the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the vice minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of having planned it all for a political issue, but in view of the request for imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in asking for the variation of the draft of the A3.
Starting from the intercepts ordered against Dal Torrione, the PM write, emerged "the readiness to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a better known group, close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy comes from the waves, now the big ones start.
This is an oversized deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface area and now the world's largest energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colossians like Chevron have laid their eyes, and now are trying to get their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has now been explored for a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil lowered, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give a great boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by sea swell operating systems.
This amount would be twice that of nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides..
Colossus in attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy was the Energis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the deal was announced, it seemed like a real revolutionary step.
With two years of this, more and more candidates among these companies dedicated to traditional energy have always relied on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying technologies on ocean energy- said a spokesman for a company associated with the American oil colossus, the economic daily Wall Street Journal- and she is assessing the possibilities to cooperate with us."
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a deliberate permit by the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to give rise to a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that precisely in Alaska, the Usa continue to extract oil, and recently President Bush set up a project for further excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which travel the route of energy coming from the sea, and the sums invested so far, although their details are not known, according to observers, show an increasing interest.
Tecnology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology still in its early stages, because marine energy does not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size and do not seem to create a major problem for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies need to be used with a higher environmental impact.
" And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the sludge upwards and downwards, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
Pressure drives a turbine that, in turn, powers a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through underwater cables.
For the time being, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a shopping center and a parking lot using six underwater turbines from the East River of New York.
The movement of the water during the tides, turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant has announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electrical Energy, deserves at the moment, the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from the wind, from the sun, or from the waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, look to the coast, have invested $7 and a half million in 2008 and are planning to invest up to $35 million in 2009.
