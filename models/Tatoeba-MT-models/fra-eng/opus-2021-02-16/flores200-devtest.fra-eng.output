This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils usually cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown brown on the top and pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
This discovery also provides a better understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, which is called rachis, but nevertheless show other characteristics specific to feathers – beards and barbula – researchers have deduced that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development subsequent to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
Scientists say it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young person.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

The work was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the black matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts traction on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that black matter affects other black matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a sort of halo, and consists of a large number of small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally an experiment of low technicality: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put in an envelope a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the officers have checked his identity, the elector throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs his voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations fairly strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision, according to specific procedures.

She first took part in the slalom, where she got a "did not finish" (DNF) in her first race. 36 of the 116 competitors achieved the same result in this race.
His other race, the giant slalom, allowed him to finish in tenth place of the women's group seated with a combined time of 4:41.30, that is 2:11.60 minutes less than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, first finish, and 1:09.02 minutes less than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, ninth finish.
In the women's sit-ski category, four skiers failed to finish their race; in the case of the giant slalom, 45 skiers out of a total of 117 in this race failed to rank.
Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We arrested five people for violating the Swiss national, and we recovered her phone and laptop."
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhatha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, Commissioner of Police, stated that the accused had a hidden face when they appeared in court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit her, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The track where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked to allow the rescue services to extract the driver from the Red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh.
She is in custody pending her trial and trial, but the eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her portrait has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that "journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish pictures, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, has told journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will focus on the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of existing borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics discussed included the future state of Jerusalem, which was sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority consents only for a period of five years.
The shooters of the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers as the test was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Park Conservation and Heritage Officer at NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first slaughter campaign were properly trained and trained in safety instructions.
Martelly inducted yesterday a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
It is the fifth CEC of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to engage the country on the road to new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to the vast protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were scheduled to take place in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it had been aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed him of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "non-serious."
The department responded by describing Apple's postponement of the report as "very unfortunate."
The earthquake struck the Mariannes at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office stated that no damage had been reported in that country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Alert Centre stated that there was no sign of tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by detouring their buses to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the death of at least six of them has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical career.
He was trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working in the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature deliveries during his spare time.
Her research has shown that if a hormone is given, it will accelerate the lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... or even more... I love her and I'm going to miss her... I hope she's resting in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal elections revealed that the number of opponents of Australia's transformation into a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents think that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31% think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist had to swim 100 m and 200 m free swim and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, these being banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and computer professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number known to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor at the beginning of this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described rumours as "talking and political nonsense."
He is expected to run for President in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly over shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technologies, not on previously used ground radar systems, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transport is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and relay parks are not available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transport created the possibility that the game could be played behind closed doors, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published on Thursday in Science magazine reported the genesis of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden indicated that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although this process was estimated to be much longer, following reproduction between an endemic Darwin pine, Geospiza fortis, and the conical-billed immigrant pine, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces
It can be pulled in fine thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or laminated in leaves.
It can be done very fine, and glued to another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "enluminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes colour depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ion (H in pH) present in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean, wet hands, press them into a ball.
Moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and produce some kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush in almost all houses, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems were found in the houses of the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public baths where men and women met.
When you call a person thousands of kilometres away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent to space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greater advantage it has brought us is that it has made transport much easier and faster.
This brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below, there are more medium-sized felines that eat equally medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free companion cats) that eat smaller, much larger prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
The pack consists of one to three related adult males, as well as about 30 females and lions.
Women are usually very close to each other, their families being made up of a large number of sisters and girls.
Lion troops act as packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large felines) in their behavior, and also very deadly for their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficult), swim, jump long distances and tow with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (gender Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones able to roar.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the broad roar of the lion, but rather a phrase whose words would be shouting and rumbling.
The ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
According to scientists, the ocelots hunt and find the animals to eat (proy) by smell, sniffing their way on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they also move very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey by melting in their environment before throwing themselves at them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or moves to a new island so that it cannot easily go back), it often finds itself in an environment different from that in which it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all, it always needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce their food using the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and plant-based clothing. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosaic was the superpredator of the time, he feared nothing except the other mosaics.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth like razor blades, as well as an additional set of teeth in the palate, so that everything that crossed its path could not escape.
We are not sure, but he may have had the forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosaics, and he may even have been cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was no size against him.
Although the Romans consumed the food we know, they ate some strange or unusual feast dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and the evening, a sort of rodent.
Another difference was that while the poor and the woman were eating their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets together where they sat on the side while they were eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not include those foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced into Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could access.
Some pyramidal towers, the ziggurates, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was in the open air.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were only open counters overlooking the street. The houses were built of stones.
Since there were no large forests in Canaan's land, wood was extremely expensive.
In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder that he found Greenland — and so named it — traveling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Although each country is " Scandinavian", there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you saw the movie Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words “Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776” could be read. The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (which is about 29 inches three quarters by 24 inches) was stored rolled.
It is therefore likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landing and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the French of Vichy, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting him.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Forces de la France Libre had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means civilian and which is related to the Latin words "civis", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means large city or city-state and which also indicates, in a way, the size of the society to which it relates.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — the Congress being its only component — under the articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the State authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from tax laws or those on customs duties between States.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all States before they could be amended and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German national team, the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of its group of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing through made mention of it under the name of Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it Qing Empire province in 1885.
In 1895, after his defeat in the first Sino-Japanese war (1894–95), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it gave over Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been reconstructed to provide tourists with a better insight into their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues until today.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the analog film era.
It's still made today, but what's important is that its image format is inherited from the photo sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, and it's quite disconcerting, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
It is therefore said that the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. family of APS formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The third-party rule, which is highly abused and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that stimulates dynamism while offering protection to the image.
It indicates that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was called into question.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked European states to each other despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from king to rotter.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's money funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than 1000 years and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder whether this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain put in place a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting down vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain undermined international waters in order to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime areas, thus constituting a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic sparked only a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its limitless underwater war.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a tendency for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred in his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his director in his previous job) to the attention of Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known of these periods is the era of the Three Kingdoms that took place for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the most bloody times in Chinese antiquity history. Thousands of people died fighting to sit on the throne of the great 11th-year palace.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, the trades were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same applies to the army, because the classification of armies is no longer based on class, but on calibre.
The French Revolution has also inspired many other repressed working classes in other countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that were beyond the framework of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous under the name of "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists. When you entered the cave, you are completely isolated.
Above, you can see nothing but the bright and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, you can see or hear very few things of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many giant structures erected in honour of the dead Pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza necropolis", in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, includes several pyramids (the great pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Kheops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The push symbol looks like a V and the pull symbol looks like a staple or a square whose bottom side is missing.
The top means you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you have to start with the rise (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow to the top usually produces a softer sound, while a bow to the bottom is stronger and more assertive.
Don't hesitate to put your own marks in pencil, but don't forget that the printed bow marks are for a musical reason, and that they must be respected in general.
On 6 October 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of saleswomen.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrorized queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Naturally, the superprofits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of order.
These events took place in the period generally considered as the High Middle Ages – period of history in Europe during the 11th to 13th century (1000-1300).
The Central Middle Ages was preceded by the Upper Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological thrust or technological imperative to a strict sense that humanity's destiny is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place in a process far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on intrinsically conditioned rather than socially conditioned societies.
For example, it could be said that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive possession of cars also leads to a greater incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new health care techniques to treat bodily harm.
Romanticism was an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to that geography would have appeared. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to the laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the capital of feudal Europe.
His reputation as the epicentre of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders came back to take care of gifts such as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th–11th century and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow pace of communication, Western modes could lag 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the crusades, was the use of buttons to close clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is an agriculture practised to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system, using preserved seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas which allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
Criteria that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often report their belongings through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerism and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered to be "ferocious" or savage; some wild children have been confined by persons (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the parents' rejection of a serious intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child.
Wild children may have been severely abused or traumatized before being abandoned or fled.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When fully bred by non-human species, wild children exhibit behaviours (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who discover new teaching such as the use of a new program or the start of a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little trombone man from Microsoft Office is also one.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to interview, guide and explain procedures that could have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but that is the case.
We see the foster care system as a safe area for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to usages and gratuities.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are seen as major factors in promoting the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal Involvement" and "Continuing Relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such ability to interpret human behaviour can be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research of the twentieth century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the reserve of the variations expressed.
Segregation and recombination alternate the variations between the two basins at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its needs for amino acids from the available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ovens, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all vital amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" a little in the same way as the chimpanzees of the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening during your sleep period and sleepiness shortly afterwards (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively silent awakening, in order to make you regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself reset the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking a lot of fluids before falling asleep (including water or tea, known to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person opposes the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present vital force. Each person has the possibility to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the way of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras activated, and the awakening consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the understanding between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see real confrontations, through alternative armies, on battlefields in Africa as well as in Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most effective means of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the mariners has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and assets, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and assets.
One of the most notable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. Americans were trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean with soldiers and equipment to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using U-Boots, tried to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagro Mountains in Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on the hills or other pasture areas, often cared for by chevers who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the more known term shepherds. These pastoral methods have always run today.
The "carways" were built in England from the 16th century.
Although the railcar tracks were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses who pulled them to reach higher speeds and to pull higher loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
The tracks were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had an iron band on top.
This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the cars.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk standing two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ("right man").
Their predecessors, the Australopitheques, did not walk as usual.
Biped specialisations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, this is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not just want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly as a result of the scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that the problems have become more important because of the overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten project signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few streets there, to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, today known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Court of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap leaves still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them dinosaurs being given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs covered with scales and with claws, they lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic drugs or domestic chemicals.
See the label for first aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are very adapted to parasitize humans.
Both bedbugs and bedbugs are nestling, i.e. adapted to live in their host's nest or habitat.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may well feel that it is not in their or the child's interest to take care of a baby's upbringing.
These couples can choose to make an adoption project for their baby.
In the context of adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which guides most scientific research.
However, this is not the only experiment, and an experiment is a test that eliminates one or more of the possible hypotheses, asks questions and makes observations, but also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to mark either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially the fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
One can, for example, visit, photograph and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns by car to get to their workplace and meet other people who will work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a passenger car-based transport system.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they break down on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
The traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate manner.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape their enemies and find food and companions more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragon flies and ephemerals.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarque claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water from the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
No less than 20% of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed by their size and technical excellence in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the daily language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are found in nature in raw form and are quite simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consisted of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
Rather, they were the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also expressed the theory that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new methods of writing has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to rarer uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil cutter.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty comes.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms the energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
It's like climbing a hill to a heavy cart, dividing the core again, then releasing a little of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible face and 100 km on the hidden face.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker below continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to go up to the surface.
Theories of content are focused on finding out what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's theory of two factors.
In general, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the leader of former colleagues. From one end of the spectrum being trying to remain "the good friend" (or the good girlfriend).
This type of manager has difficulty in making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she has to change everything that the group has created so far and do things in its own way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This often leads to dissensions between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member is accountable and sets standards for each of them.
Why would an organization want to impose the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the substantive services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process to meet the client's needs.
Before an organisation is innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own learning culture.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus reducing the field of research and making it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of damage, injury, tumours and brain trauma affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and hardware to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often highly sci-fi, it is a very important part of the computer sciences that study the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The purpose of artificial intelligence research is automation by task machines requiring an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, ability to respond to clients' diagnoses and questions, and recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to separate disciplines, focusing on the provision of solutions to the problems of daily life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the army, as it has been installed in several home computer and video game software.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can watch the ancient objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a superb work of art while sitting with their class.
Practically taking part in an excursion is also an excellent way to think about a trip and share its experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often try the blog experience with a neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes the situation.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog's author is beginning to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "requires students to know more about the world around them." The need for public interest encourages students to be smart and interesting (Toto 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When good use is made of it, blogs "can help students to strengthen their analytical skills and critical thinking: by actively reacting to online content, they can compare their opinions to those of others and present their own views on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south you will find Niagara Falls and to the north, the Muskoka area and its surroundings which have a virgin natural beauty.
All of these measures, and many others, make Ontario what foreigners regard as Canada's quintessence.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more Afro-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the East African coast.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent by itself, in terms of wildlife.
Most small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known to be luxury seaside resorts.
Arabs have also brought the practice of Islam to the land and this religion has spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Town road linking Europe with India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear an alliance (which should not seem too precious.
Women need to realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviours that they consider to be harassment, because it is common for them to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing men's advances, and don't be afraid to hold on (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sinners in the 10th century B.C.E., and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after destroying it had rebuilt it and baptized Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading counters there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to make purchases.
In the vicinity of the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, narghiles and bevels of all kinds, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma must be researched to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for mountain gorillas tracking treks among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motor taxi) to move around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a small race.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World show on the PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the cities of the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located north-east of South Africa and runs along the Mozambique border to the east, from Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km2, divided into 14 ecozones, each with a specific wildlife.
It is one of the most famous amusement parks in South Africa and considered to be the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It may be advantageous to get a Wild Card that provides access to some South African parks, as well as to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main focus for many tourists.
The row of buildings drawing the horizon of Hong Kong has been compared to a scintillating bar graph, which reveals itself by reflection in the waters of the Port of Victoria.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and join the seafront of Kowloon located opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on the island of Hong Kong is concentrated on the northern shore.
This is the place that British settlers have invested, so it seems to me a good starting point, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called the Sundarban National Park.
The forests, however, are not composed solely of mangrove marshes; they also contain some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered with water/marcage areas.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, where you can find about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the Interdistrict Bus Station (located on the other side) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often complete, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese coasters, which are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a hiuban bridge. It overlooks the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque to Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two tracks of 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian Customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in subsistence farming.
Other indigenous tribes that populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or Payaguá, survived mainly through fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once known as "the giant province of India", was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and games are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and places to buy tickets for polo games, visit Polo's Argentina Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the pound of the Falkland Islands (FKP) whose value is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only island bank in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
Pound sterling is a widely accepted currency throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the surrounding islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if British and American currencies may be. Talk about it in advance with the owners in order to agree on a method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Falklands outside the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to the summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone and summer temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than what the thermometer says.
There aren't really any "rainy" and "dry" seasons: precipitation is roughly constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are wildlife; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, at least 100 metres from bears and wolves and 25 metres from all other wildlife!
As docile as they may appear, bison, elk, moose, bear and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid transporting or cooking smelly food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally in the city during the struggle of independence organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, as Auckland is riding on two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
North Shore Beaches (in the North Harbour District) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and allow to swim safely, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the port of Waitemata, in the chic suburb of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in the centre of Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes frequented by families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is the "Number One", a beer quite ordinary, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the "Manta".
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink local tap water safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "cream coffee" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", the cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many reef trips are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, box jellyfish arrive near beaches and river estuaries, and can sometimes be seen outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would deviate from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
The advance reservation gives the traveller the peace of mind to know that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, transportation from/to the airport, or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They may also retain the reservation for you if you need time to reflect on the offer or to obtain other documents necessary for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider this to be an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed camping area.
Don't forget that even if the musical performances are finished on the main stages, other musical performances can continue until late at night on other festival sites.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noises at the most exposed cabins.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are rarely found, and outings can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of dishes, drinks and entertainment in order to maintain the good mood of the guests and keep them there.
On some sites, locals offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. Nevertheless, drunkenness alters judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone travelling by car to high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During the blizzards, it can fall in very little time enough snow to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted all year round.
The safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important moment for many visitors.
In common language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion to African land, and in particular to the savannah, with the aim of witnessing the striking spectacle of wild animals in their environment.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars closely and standard equipment allows them to be observed.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a bush walk, walking safari or footing) consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations in 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March most cancellation policies based on coronaviruses do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing about 7,000 yen.
By ironing wet clothes, you can make them dry more easily. Many hotels have iron and ironing board that can be loaned, even if there are none in the rooms.
If you don't have an iron or do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if you find one.
Avoid letting the fabric overheat (which can cause its shrinkage or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some localities, it is enough to boil the water for one minute; in others, it is necessary to do it for several minutes.
The efficiency of the filters varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a renowned company.
Travellers may encounter harmful animals they do not know in their area of origin.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that may injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some communities, duty-free shops provide an opportunity to purchase property exempt from excise taxes and duties.
Travellers to countries with high taxes can sometimes make considerable savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your mind open: steep slopes, narrow lanes and tight curves predominate.
The speed limitations shown are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict compliance is even greater than before.
On the other hand, mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are rather good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common: apples are cooked and baked in pastry all year round, while cherries and plums point the end of their nose in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often blend particularly well with a tight cup of coffee.
If you want small but copious pastries, try the Berliner balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made of herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be "solid" or "liquid", depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, and Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualifier, it tends to refer to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of dishes that are simply seasoned, the predominant flavors that Javanese prefer are peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety problem: indeed, the user's feet can remain stuck there.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has a foot caught in the stirrup, it could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth and fairly narrow heel and sole.
Then, some stools, especially the English, have safety bars that allow a litter to fall from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the South American Yosemite, with many large walls and different granite cliffs.
From the top of the mountain, the panoramas on the mountains are unobstructed. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly discovering new paths on the slopes, where the possibilities are unlimited.
Downhill winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down a snow-covered trail with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many aficionados, sometimes called "ski bums", who organize their entire holiday according to skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings showing skiers date for some 5,000 years BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century; the first leisure ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking skiing.
This is similar to alpine-type hiking skiing, as well as mountaineering, but does not generally include these activities, which are practised on rugged terrain and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to travel a little longer than on foot – but you will only very rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries, and in traditional circumstances, travelling across several countries means having to apply for several visas and undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions a little like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without returning through passport checkpoints.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each of the space member countries, which saves time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition to determine whether a manufactured object is an antique. Some tax agencies define property over 100 years old as antiques.
The criteria vary depending on where you are; in some parts of the world, as in North America, the age limit may be lower than that in Europe.
Artisan products can be considered antiques, even if they are less old than similar industrial products.
Reindeer farming is an important means of subsistence for the Sami and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer farming, they were involved in fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer primarily as line animals.
Today, many Sami practice modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
Although widely used, particularly among non-Romans, the term “Gitan” is often considered pejorative because of its association with negative stereotypes and a distorted image of the Roma people.
If the country you are travelling to is the subject of a warning to travellers issued by your government, your foreign health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also use advice from governments other than yours, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East might face situations different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
The opinions are only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and too simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that could cause damage, serious social upheaval or loss of human life.
Very adverse weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of several kinds, depending on geographical, topographical and atmospheric characteristics.
Violent winds, hail, excessive precipitation and fires are forms and effects of violent weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea trombes and cyclones.
Extreme, regional and seasonal weather events include cold storms, snow storms with strong winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to learn about the risks of bad weather that may affect their destination area, knowing that this may have an impact on the routes they are planning.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
A search on the Internet of "Less Environment Course" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
Training normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes weapons-handling training.
Books and magazines dealing with wild survival are common, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning a change of sex abroad must ensure that they have in their possession documents valid for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports whose sex is not indicated (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and sex varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is equally variable.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Transsexual persons in the pre-operative phase should not expect to pass the scanners while preserving their privacy and dignity.
The ripping currents are the currents that return from the waves that break on the beach, often on a pit or equivalent.
Due to underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a rapid current to the deep waters can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from an attempt to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, returning to swimming is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you will not be caught again. It is also possible, that depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted or not, you may want to wait for help.
The reintegration shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who have had difficulty adapting to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to adapt to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost certain habits of your original culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the region's most interesting attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the beginning of the show.
Usually, you always hear the noise of tourists and sellers. The history of sound and light is like a book of history.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and narrator of a long history.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: the island of Livingston and the Deception, where the caldera flooded with a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural port.
Ellsworth Land is the southern part of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula melt in the plateau, then reappear to form the 360-km mountain range of Ellsworth, crossed by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Mountains, comprises the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which peaks at 4892 m.
In remote locations, without a cellular telephone network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a mobile phone, because you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure craft, as well as by shipments that have remote data transmission and telephony needs.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about the connection to this service.
Those planning a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them choose this possibility.
This formula is particularly appreciated by young people who leave school, as it allows them to take a year's leave before university, without compromising their studies.
Often, having taken sabbatical year courses abroad can actually give you a better chance of pursuing higher education in your country.
As a general rule, registration fees are required to attend these educational programs.
Finland is a destination of choice for boating. The "Land of the Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Recreational boating is a national hobby in Finland, with a boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most of the cruises on the Baltic Sea are characterized by a prolonged stay in St Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go to shore with cruise trips, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the seaside and no visit to this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
We must not be ashamed of it: it is not different from the personal fears and fears that many people experience about other things.
For some, understanding something about the operation of aircraft and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not having control.
Transportation companies are well paid for quick deliveries. Often, in the context of urgent repair, the issue of delays is crucial for the documents, goods or spare parts that relate to them.
On some roads, large companies have their own planes, but on other roads and for small businesses, there has been a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on certain routes, it would have taken days to pass the unloading and customs.
The only way to send it more quickly was to send it as checked baggage. Air regulations will not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that is where you intervene.
The most obvious way to travel first class or business class is to pay a large amount of money for this privilege (or, better yet, to ask your business to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for the business class, and eleven times for the first class!
Generally speaking, there is no need to seek reductions for business-class or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of travellers who are willing to pay very expensive privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their rates in an informed manner.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but recognized by no United Nations member country.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is Turkey's third largest city, the second port after Istanbul, and an excellent connecting platform.
What was the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern shopping centre, developed and living, set around a huge bay, surrounded by mountains.
The large boulevards, glazed buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional roofs in red tiles, from the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and houses an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures depicting doves on some graves.
It is worth walking for half an hour in this fascinating village.
The romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, located in the north, is easily accessible and has been made famous to strangers by Lord Byron's brilliant account of its splendor.
Scotturb's 403 bus regularly goes to Sintra, with a stop in Cabo da Roca.
As you travel north, don't miss the magnificent shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (temple), a place known worldwide for the apparitions of Mary.
Remember that you visit essentially a mass grave, as well as a site that has an almost incalculable significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who survived their stay here, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labour, Jews or non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not defigure the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, because the law establishes that this is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the subway are made only in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave at best, to act like a very high person. This will greatly facilitate your travel.
The abrupt exteriors of Parisians evaporate quickly if you show a minimum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly beech, spruce and fir, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a wide variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils and altitude levels.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal species and birds.
Rare animals such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and large tetras can be seen there, as well as many other common species.
When visiting a monastery, women must wear skirts covering their knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide stoles to women who arrive without anything, but if you bring yours, and in addition it has bright colors, you will have a smile of the monk or nun at the entrance.
Just as men have to wear pants covering their knees.
We can also borrow this garment from the stock at the entrance, but since it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. A unique size for men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and all available condiments, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, followed by the word Sie which means you, always start with a capital, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an excellent way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The main letters to be monitored are c and g, since their pronunciation varies according to the next vowel.
Please also make sure to say "r" and "rr" in a separate way: "caro" means "cheap", while "carro" means "caro".
Persian has a relatively easy grammar and most of the time regular.
Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
It goes without saying that if you know a Roman language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough to do so so so that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution in their time was not as worrying as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge infrastructure in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favourable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where plum flowers were the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first feasts of cherry blossoms were organized by the emperor only for himself and the other members of the nearby aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look the best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "one".
If you visit a strictly landscaped garden, the collection of "samples" will also cause you to be expelled without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to move, and where you can buy almost everything you need once you arrive there.
But, located in the "high tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to adapt to the heat (always) and to a strong sunlight (when the sky is clear, which is more rare).
There are also some buses to the north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you are planning to take is going to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kyriat Arba.
Inland waterways can be an excellent theme for holidays.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or make a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube or make a boat along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for hiking trails and popular bike paths.
Christmas is one of Christendom's most important festivals, it celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions related to these festivals have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians throughout the world.
It is a tradition to spend the night of Easter awake in an open place to see the sunrise.
Of course there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches often organize a Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into the feast at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived on these islands originally did so by water, swimming, floating objects, or by air.
Because of the great distance that separates them from the continent, mammals were unable to reach the end of the voyage, making the giant turtle the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can discover the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to admire the northern lights, as the sky will be dark almost all day long.
Because the regions are sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that to which Westerners can be accustomed.
Costumes are classic workwear, and employees are called by their family name or function.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial because it emphasizes collective effort rather than praise individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain the consent of their superiors for any decision they make and are supposed to obey the instructions of their superiors without asking questions.
