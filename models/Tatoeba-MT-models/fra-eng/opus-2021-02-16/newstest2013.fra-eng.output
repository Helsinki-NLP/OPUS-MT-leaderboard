A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre views the latter as a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
Indeed, Republican lawyers have only recorded 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments enacted new laws from 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which saw 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require electors to present a photo ID card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
These laws also reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day and remove the right to vote from citizens with legal records.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana's law in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they had sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have universal identity cards such as the health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID card.
Much more.
Students, who are considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID card issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote the cards issued by these clubs.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators sponsored legislation in 2011 abolishing voter registration on election day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states to reduce the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter represented only 13% of state voters.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
They accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In return, 76% of the voters were whites, representing only 46% of the voters voting in advance.
Of course the democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of the democratic governors.
The US Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could have partially limited the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as a clear objective to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Centre shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes necessary for the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: passing the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes present erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men who are already reluctant to take screening tests even more hesitant.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In studies in the United States, there was a lot of contamination among control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between those who had been screened and those who had not.
This study has also shown, with follow-up after 12 years, that between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if not tested.
So I recommend testing from age 50, or from age 40 if you have a direct parent who has ever had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
The patient must be made aware of the level of risk of his or her cancer, by offering him or her the options available, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect life in the long term, and by opting instead, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest that they do active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
Increasingly, precise criteria are being determined to determine who should or should not be treated.
So I still recommend taking the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with his doctor to determine whether we should go through it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the APS test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, the adoption of good lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of harm.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, this rate would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many also remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Cigarettes are related to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
It's very harmful to people's health.
"Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer falls by half.
Weight
Overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease, according to CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer," he adds.
Food
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
Too much, it increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
Charcuterie too, and they should be avoided.
The storage of meat by smoking, drying or salting may result in the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"These can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," it is explained.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research, however, is not conclusive at this time.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to CSC.
While one noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established either.
Mr. Beaulieu also stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his physician.
"To take a screening test, it doesn't give cancer."
The Higgs shelled boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created a whole stir last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that this is Higgs.
We know without a shadow of doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be absolutely certain.
Let us assume, however, that this is the Higgs, since the chances of getting wrong seem slim, and let us see what this is about.
There is, in this world, a fatally unavoidable law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
Even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - that "state" consisting roughly in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner there are good citizens named fermions, who obey the principle of Pauli wisely.
And in the other are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, depending on the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not approach here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosons, it must be emphasized here, are not all as exotic as we might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "messager" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "dranges" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a bit like a rock thrown into a pond.
From this "drangement" comes an electromagnetic wave (from light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "force carriers".
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, except that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" in order for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to reach very, very high energies, a bit as if it were a frozen pond, only a very large rock could ride the surface.
This is why it takes a huge particle accelerator like that of CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference! - to reach such energies.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and mass.
Not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold on to a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while others (like photon, hold) don't.
Now, what can "bring" all this research, asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to examine any discrepancies between observations and predictions of the MS.
There are many who want to find them, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has huge deficiencies, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oops!).
But we haven't found such discrepancies at CERN until now.
Impact
The impact of this research on Mr. and Mrs. All-the-World's daily lives is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
Here: in the early 1960s, laser pioneers in Bell Laboratories had no suspicion of the revolution that their work would trigger.
They were sending scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already told us the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 - initially the laser was rather seen as a "lab gandget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from the entire instrumentation that surrounds the search.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his optical work.
This sensor, although not at all its original intent, now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras in the world, and earned it the Nobel Prize in Physics 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die...
With its Commission to Die in Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this crucial area.
The Devoir tried to take a closer look at it.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was eating him had left him with a two-year respite.
"They had given me five years to live, I did seven years," he said, half-figue half-raisin, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents it from going alone to the toilet, and even eating alone.
Attached to an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, speaks to strangers who work around him, bring him his medicine, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is for me to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is pissing on his feet," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the house of Victor-Gadbois.
Regressing at the child's stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to accept regression," he notes.
Because, in the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a life prognosis of up to three months.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides so-called "curative" care.
For Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "conscious and suffocated".
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more wishes in life," she said, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, however, she is waiting for a last visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid are provided.
It is palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 people.
It's very little when you know you all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, says Dr.Christiane Martel, one of the home's doctors.
Whether in terms of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
If you're dying, you'll be willing to take care of your mouth with brandy or Pepsi, depending on your request.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, Mr. X was served a beer, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help loved ones as much as patients," says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At the house of Victor-Gadbois, the days follow each other but do not resemble each other.
Along with an old 93-year-old man who enjoyed his last family assembly in the courtyard, well-sheltered in his pillows while being toasted in his honour, a 36-year-old man tragically died, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, there are still three to five beds that are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients who are admitted to the house Victor-Gadbois arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal stage of his or her life, whether at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec's health care that makes many palliative care physicians fear the adoption of legislation governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care leaders including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health care system is not strong enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before they agree to proceed with euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency, in great pains, without being taken care of.
I'm afraid patients are only asking to die because they don't get the proper care.
And at the same time, several oncologists work on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard's life expectancy was already minimal when she dropped out of hard chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she told me.
But she told me I was done!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not having responded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Palliative Care at the Society of Home Palliative Care in Greater Montreal, patients would be resistant to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which amounts to sleeping the patient until his or her death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Sick people who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me", it means "I want to be relieved".
This report was made possible through a journalism award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, political party fund-raisers and specialists in the Italian mafia tell day by day what they know of a formidable "system", combining the building industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
A "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers a lot, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has crumbled since we took the big steps," says Jacques Duchesneau, MP for Quebec City and former chief of police for Montreal.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a thorough investigation into the malpractices related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had consented only backwards.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, hidden party financing and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the survey in 2010, he points out, the only Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars on contracts", some refretting their instincts to get a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors", he added, hoping that it will succeed in "showing the schemes behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also working with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More the officers of the "Marteau squad" who, since 2009, would have led the "cartel of sewers" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the swellings of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out mass searches and laid charges of fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as Mayor of Laval, the third city in Quebec.
He is suspected of having repeatedly taken bribes in exchange for public contracts.
There are also formal charges against Montreal-based engineers and Italian-born entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who paid the money back to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr.Zambito sowed at all winds in the 2000s, giving more than C$88,000 (about €68,000) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts, the cost of which he overstated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked roundly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, gave it detailed information before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totalling $736,000, in exchange for sewerage contracts, the costs of which he inflated.
Other road officials confessed to getting their leg greased by swelling bills from 30% to 40%, by fake extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget fuelling his caisses with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, immersing Montreal in a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected officials to sound the alarm bell.
Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, to the east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million to developers, in the middle of a real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, she says that she "draws on a wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin the wrongdoers".
The process, she says, is "painful but positive."
We're cleaning up the wound, but we'd need a Montréal-specific investigation unit and a wake-up call, so we don't have to see suspicious practices coming back.
Just like cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elected aware of the scheme", when they were not soaked in the mess!
Estimating 70% of the dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he ironically said: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but it will not change the situation, according to him: "As long as election expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He called for a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and party financing: "We cannot go any further; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will make it possible to rebuild the house on a stronger basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Every day, I progress by their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And in the game, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not inflamed.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training center to my visit to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced in steps.
So you take advantage of the competition set up by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
He is supported by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man in the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no match in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won a lot of titles with hupped clubs.
He's been with a lot of big players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a heartwarming discussion with him.
I then came out of a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of leader.
But we're still ambushed.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th finals with the way.
What is the club's objective in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
First we want to finish first of our hen, in front of Porto, so we can receive on the 8th of the final return.
Can the PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and register for the duration.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the MTP provides the means for this project to materialize.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really have a lot to do with this title of champion.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a really big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It's normal to expect a lot from us in view of what's been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
After that, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame for, it's sure it's a bit frustrating.
We wonder what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We've proven in the Champions League that we can answer the questions.
Look at Manchester City who hasn't been able to qualify for the 8th in the finals for two seasons, they've also spent a lot of money!
In view of the sums invested, we imagined you with 15 points in advance to the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can have a smile by telling ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
The PSG seems to be totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Good for us to say there's a "Zlatan addiction."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and has many goals.
He came here for this and proves that he's the Ligue 1 star.
He showed everywhere he went that he was a great player, a global star.
In the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did was really exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best advocates in the world, also allows everyone to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I was very keen to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grabbing playing time.
I've seen things there and I've come out of it strengthened.
Today, I manage to make good matches in selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized with the Blues.
Lessons have been learned from what happened in Ukraine and we must now have exemplary behaviour.
What are you looking at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Bleus?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifier group for the World.
The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the winner.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good draw (1-1) torn off on 16 October in Spain a founding match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never had a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite is true of current currency exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows peer-to-peer file exchange.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded with 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin price, after reaching a top of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $2 five months later, before returning today around ten dollars (the prices are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has been interested in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "virtual currency with the most success", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin stands out from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to advance in a video game that you win while playing or can buy (and sometimes trade back).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But each time, a central authority controls and processes trade.
With Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are both depository of the book of accounts, auditors, issuers of currency, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses like an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to make sure that the bitcoins exchanged exist in the public account book, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, which the winner, a sort of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file hashing phase, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hash" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to fraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other still orphaned because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, leaving a margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also met with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The flaw used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also mentions the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Actors of weight like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant balances" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, believes a lot in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus return less expensive.
The holder also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
All they need to do is communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that thousands of users are available.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for bitcoin to come in, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered to be high, if this currency is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for us.
Above all, we have punished Afghan peasants as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, as in the days of the Soviets.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, these will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done in order.
The convoys of trucks and armoured personnel joined Kabul without being attacked, flying over helicopters.
There will be no Taliban outbursts into Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood as a result of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then seen as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants, who have been overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mujahedin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a inferior position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into traders, seizing government lands to sell them to refugees who had returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge American subcontracts.
They have demeaned; most of them have not fought themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to benefit from the American vastnesses: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They lived alongside the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that will order it be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain degree of decentralization, like the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
No industry has been restarted, no dams are in repair, no major irrigation systems are repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise has been spread that Afghanistan has immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that Westerners were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine in Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the province's largest employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are heavily dependent, will also need to restore normal relations.
The departure of French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new Cooperation Treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: high school for girls, boys, French department at university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "gain hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has carried out, and has carried out by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, which is greedy of local labour, has helped to contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and an increase in arable land.
What will we leave to remember, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys often located at more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, which the farmers have told me they wish to do, a small, well-controlled civil aid which directly affects them should be maintained in their favour.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It's a new poker game for President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, it has decided to play its part.
Taking everyone short, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State granted this House an additional two months to complete its work.
Egypt has been relying on a provisional text for almost two years, several times amended, which undermines institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "cross his word" and "piet the law".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that this is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, by speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to give up their plans to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, this is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy as the protest rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since this use of a hasty vote is due to the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: "You are voting for my text, that is to say, I keep the full powers", they are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most Liberals were missing.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing that they had not been able to put forward their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added in haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it was most often unanimously that the articles were voted on.
Commentators were amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the hour of prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the constituent pendulum was wrongly settled.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
The object of all attentions, Article 2 remains finally identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to be able to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the Liberals replied, who saw only one communication.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
These include section 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, particularly in verifying compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the beginnings of a theocracy."
The Liberals' fears are further exacerbated by the fact that the next president of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" temper Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around section 220, because the terms used borrow from religious vocabulary.
It refers to "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question might arise in the future as to the extent to which civilian judges are competent to rule on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the former regime.
Another point at issue is the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will trials of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they considered to be liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially in the press.
In addition, there are no articles that echo the protection of women, says Human Rights Watch's Heba Morayef.
The only positive point, she said, was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
The support of the Head of State will parade them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the center of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the grandeur of Bible truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has chosen five main reasons to go to Israel.
Go and worship the holy places
Make yourself a must: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone entering these "baptical foundations" will be touched by divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the earth of Jesus' miracles: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
It was at this particular place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
The believers travel through the Rue de la Souffrance or the Way of the Cross (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the court), where the trial was held, then led by the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the Unction and the tomb.
Here is the Christian center of the world, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which is the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave small words with prayers that are then answered.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, former refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 B.C. for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can get there by their own means.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m of altitude, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to have once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
Unable to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth a visit.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It houses the ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
Also worth seeing is the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
The paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are exhibited.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of casts of visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter in total darkness.
Stars are shining.
You then hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and welfare
Israel's three major seaside resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each offers swimming pools, water parks, delphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the water temperature does not fall below 21° and the air temperature can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, that is, 417 m below sea level.
Azure-coloured water contains brine and very easily retains bathers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of surrealist beauty.
We come to perform a treatment based on salt water, silt, curative sludge and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also simply to relax.
Discover the secrets of ancient times
They are guarded by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially enjoy walking through narrow alleys that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile on you.
In Jaffa you will be able to meet newlyweds coming to make photo shoots of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll in the Roman theatre, "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you leave for Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, because they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar equals 3.8 shekels).
With regard to urban transport, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, composed of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturdays, markets, shops and public transport cease to operate.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes composed of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes made from lamb and beef, soups and desserts made from coconut milk but also humous, traditional Jewish paste, different sauces, balls of ground chickpeas, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are a lot of well-fed cats walking around the haughty air.
We can see them sleeping at night on the roofs of the parked cars.
These cats love passing places and don't refuse to treat them.
The rental of a car varies according to the brand from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of the numbers
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists travelled to the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011.
"Who language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists are debating what the law on mandatory language testing will give, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law had entered into force and stipulated that every migrant worker would have to pass a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, over time, promises the Federal Migration Service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language, as well as of the history of Russia and the foundations of law, will have to be validated.
You will have to validate your language skills in Russian in order to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Persons who obtained educational certificates or diplomas prior to the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not covered by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to take examinations in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law enters into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what will it do?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service respond, it will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery at work".
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains Victor Sebelev, director of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellow men will torment himself for months without food and paper and will have to trim between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing, and when they arrive, we deceive them, we take their passport, and they do not receive the expected salary," confirms the Head of the Directorate of Migration Services for the Work of the Migration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many Central Asian republic nationals who wish to come and earn money in Russia say that they do not only know the language of the country to which they wish to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to attend even fair primary education.
Indeed, their families don't even have enough to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave to earn money as soon as the opportunity presents itself.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they trust.
"You feel diminished and diminished."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the Language Act.
The examinations will be intended only for migrants with legal status.
Without status, there will be no formal examination or work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or defense to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then you can get a fake recording quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have a record, hence the cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," told journalists Oumed Khushkadamov, a national of Tajikistan.
"Make it quick, don't mess up and buy yourself a beautiful piece of art"
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that the registration documents of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The falsified papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: each migrant who thus hoped to facilitate the task of the examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Representatives of power and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "paper sticks".
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination for the first time time time to take language courses.
Moreover, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against the carrying of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it is the shooting at the weddings or the killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to prohibit the wearing of rubber bullet weapons in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining the weapons licence from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for Security and the Fight against Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the law on arms would be introduced in the State Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, demanded to abandon "this insane hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, said Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from obtaining supplies from the black market.
According to them, any weapon can be found today in Moscow for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market supplies itself through several channels.
There are five main channels, says Victor Baranets, retired colonel who served ten years in the Department of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking arms commands
The first is the "military trace", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians," explains Baranets.
The second type of weapons from the black market is those stolen by criminals from law enforcement agencies.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stocks and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
The illegal pistols go for sale from the military warehouses.
Many of the latter have often experienced explosions.
"Attested versions indicate that some fires were deliberately triggered to conceal the deficit," explains the former military officer.
For Baranets, arms manufacturers have something to do with it.
"We see private arms factories that don't compete with international competition and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," says one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A significant proportion of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply," adds the former military.
Where did the guns come from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on this issue was established in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analysed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data of weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers explain, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found there "because of the fault of the employees whose work is related to the weapons", it is explained in the report.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from military conflict sites, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture, and 5% are from "storage digs".
A seller and consultant of an armoury who asked to remain anonymous ensures that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these illegal search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, the sellers will pick up the new goods in the military warehouses.
The person buys through a sign a unit, e.g. a TT gun.
We deliver it to him by passing the goods through a fence.
"He transports it to the city and resells it for 900 € per unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so when crimes are about to be clarified, they make a purchase of control from illegal arms dealers," adds the seller.
"As in a luxury store"
The seller and buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I visited sites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to the Begovaya train station where someone was going to take me to a "corner" to bargain.
The price of the gun, they gave it to me on the spot.
Victor Baranets as Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the salesman. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers on the markets, but there you have to come also by saying, for example, "From such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of a person I trust.
He only gives it to me because he knows I won't give it.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Victor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The diagrams, according to him, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
"I thought I was in a luxury store," remembers the military.
There is no secret to the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, we go with the forest salesman and set up a target.
"They let me shoot and when I'm convinced that the weapon works well, we start negotiating," the expert describes.
A shop from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
There is no need for any documents and no one to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise amount of money," is written as an advertisement on the website "Buy a gun or a combat machine gun".
Users leave their request and ask questions.
And we sell to the miners?
"Without a permit, of course", asks the user "Ivan" (spelling retained).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of fake sites and picks up people who want to buy combat weapons.
People rush on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia

I have heard of this type of scheme: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of the Russian laws.
People take the lead.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden", explains the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, you can find yourself unarmed and behind bars.

A Makarov for 100 dollars
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "Right to a weapon" association, one can buy a Makarov gun for 100-300 dollars.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It was removed from the long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the official data of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes overall decreased in Russia by 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles while the proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
United States: Fast food and supermarket employees are on strike
Almost a quarter of American teens go through cashier work at McDonald's
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against the low wages of Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the time being, no one can predict whether this wave is going to increase or run out quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In addition to the modest wage increases received by basic employees at Walmart and in fast food chains, the organizers of the events want the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", at a time when a rain of sales grabbing millions of people fell on America and sometimes triggering esclandres.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs to organize pickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in the company's stores whose products are intended for consumers of the modest and middle classes.
Walmart markets everything: from diapers to hunting rifles to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
This is why many poorly paid employees at Walmart shop only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products especially because of the low salaries of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of portable forklifts or scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" protests asked for a salary increase, they complained that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the base employee at Walmart who gets $9.5 an hour, that's an amount he can't afford.
Scientists at the California University of Berkley show that if Walmart raised the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
This is 1.1% more than he currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all the wage increases to the consumer's shoulders, each race in the store would be 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12.39 more than now in a year.
Walmart's supporters noted with satisfaction that the protests had taken place in only nine States and had not harmed the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8 a.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5000 items per second during this period.
His caisses made a total of 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".
Dan Fogleman's spokesman assured in an interview at the left-wing Huffington Post that in any case "less than five" Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a "com' operation among so many" on the part of the organizing union.
"Next client!"
The protests continued this week in New York City and were not about Walmart stores (in this progressive city they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet established there) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and pay you the work you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food increases over time, but on average, its core employees earn $8.90 per hour in New York City.
No one touches less than them in this town.
For me it's inconceivable to live with that money in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal Forum there are comments that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
Protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that fast food cashiers and cooks be paid a minimum of $15 per hour, a multiplication of more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union protesters through bullying or dismissal.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking over fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the most important is the extraordinary turnover of staff.
They disagree.
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the gathering in the middle of the day near McDonald's in Times Square with the intervention of several local democrat politicians, including that of Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly!".
The protesters were supported by other New York Democrats in view, notably by Mayor Bill De Blasio's candidate who said that "we all need to support fast food workers to get a fair salary and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the most important event in the fast food industry in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated and not all of them were fast-food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
For the moment it is difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will make little ones.
"At the moment, we only manage to deceive the brain moderately"
Lately, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to seeing augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it appears from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already of ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to widen the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has for the time being remained at the pixels on flat screen and sometimes at the touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is selling without Kinect today because everyone is interested in the control by gesture.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although the Kinect has made the physical interaction, a lot of things happen on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information entry has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance at this time is not really good.
We try to change this and we work on truly 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out of ours, into the physical world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the surrounding space.
Thus, we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
It's appreciated, but isn't it overestimated?
It cannot be said that this is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of his actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the camera, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to put this can on?
You would do it with words and gestures.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at some point?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the very near future we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what don't you like about modern cameras?
They lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, adding work to algorithm designers.
We must bear in mind the resolution according to axes X and Y, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s are really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, of our Redmond laboratory, gave the sensor touch a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 μs, the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much it influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device of this type in my job, but don't need to touch, to have more frames on the second.
- But shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or worsen it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define the locations.
- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from a point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around all the time with a smartphone hands up is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be an augmented reality "transitory" that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and that is what makes them strong (the personal elements are the ones you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the augmented reality from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to mere mortals.
There is a problem that opponents of this idea point to: there is no tactile sensation!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your group's responses to this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
At the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image medium.
It perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasound rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the fingertips.
There are also wrist straps that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also an axis of work with perspectives.
- And you tried to deceive the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still one task below on which it will take a long time to get hurt: the way to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that he is walking in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the moment, we can only manage to deceive the brain moderately, there are still many years of work left.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "L'avant-garde petersbourgeoise" dedicated to the city dwellers who are in advance, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the art scene of St.Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city's border and who have found recognition in Europe, after having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extraverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that you can meet near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in trendy parties and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always bring together crowds, regardless of where they are exhibited.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical peterbourgeois storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a distinguished representative of the peterbourgeois avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took a barbarian organ into his hands and became the symbol of this instrument in St.Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role because of its existence, philosophy and image as a bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you travel the city all red and not yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a couturier specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not grey arouses aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to begin the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Cultural Palace where my work was located.
I realized it was my way.
So, the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, kind of, were misunderstood.
I began to associate myself with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina which gave birth to "Puchinskaya-10" and then there was no wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
- It was important for me to be at the centre of St. Petersburg culture where the best creative forces must gather.
In 1995, I took my place in Pushkinskaya-10 which housed before the works a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the bohemian peterbourgeois bohemian.
Many were born there: The NAMEs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arriving with the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in playbacks in tight jerseys, they were among them Igor Vdovin, composer today fashionable.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg played a lot of shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that's when his great career began, but his basic education and training, it was at our home that he received them.
Galerie "D137", Club "Grigoïedov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees went there as habitués.
I'm a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Paint of the Year," and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong topicality and acuity.
I'm going to have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum Through Clowns."
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it's afraid to be like this.
But with clowns, everything disappears, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we have to spit at him.
And the lie will be erased by the disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the organ player in Barbaria.
Who other than me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today, commercial art must be treated, delicate, liqueur.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into herds, bohemian supporters loved one thing, denied them another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw away who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come and at the end of the day it's less management, less money, less money.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that usually are the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
They say: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money precisely for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the reign of the good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow, there are today good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are out of the way, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and make a way for them.
At present, it is the "goose of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who have to find other museums.
- What do you think St. Petersburg is?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for that.
And on our stones, art has trouble pushing.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
In our home, this layer is very thin.
We have to make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Delivering in Space
Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with groundmen on board set out to search for a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a great question arises: how can we continue to live our species in weightlessness or on a relief planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
"It's Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg Astronomical State Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the surface temperature of Venus is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitudes or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, we were experimenting with plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from the Earth's varieties.
Then we put insects, small, reproductive drosophilic flies into orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to see how an embryo was developing in weightlessness.
At the exit, we get a completely normal chick.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is related to the fact that the chick has to find a support, he has to stand on his feet and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IPB) Vladimir Sychev.
By finding no support, the chicks were agitated in a disorderly way.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophying.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
"We have scarred their eyes twice, then we have given up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature arch" with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the "Bion" biosatellite will only carry species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"They were still biosatellites and then it's the only experiment. We have to do this kind of research," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions are not yet possible directly in space.
It's no small deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike beasts, man is able to do so, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the feminine organism is what humanity has the most precious.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could say if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the robbery.
"No one answered this question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadze, retired from the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been in orbit twice and even working in extra-vehicular environments, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts that have had nothing and that give birth to healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: mandatory step in flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train for extra-vehicular outputs.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults, the water is comfortable but however a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby progresses about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's stomach, it is easier to get used to water afterwards.
This is in principle logical, because from his birth until his first bath, only 2 weeks are spent.
"It's very little to forget," explains infant swim instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the stomach, of the pelvis atrophy very quickly, the ability of the baby to push is lost.
All right, let's ignore that by relying on the birth simulators.
Of course we can prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will manage to get him out.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite reflection on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the Earth's attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or muscle system.
You can't dress an infant like an adult with a special combination for workouts.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience, which we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely maladapted," says the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a theory.
However, with time this will become a reality, when the Earthlings travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their descendants born in space.
The head of the ISC (Superior Institution for the Control of Public Finances) said: "the control of pseudo self-employment (in Czech " Švarc system") failed because of politicians.
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and high-quality legislation, but it is lagging behind in its implementation.
This was stated by Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Institution in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in us," Kala said in his comment on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice Petr Nečas' approach to the "Švarc system".
Mr. Prime Minister recently said that the ODS was not going to bother contractors with controls, so is it allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it forbids something, even the head of government cannot prevent an inspection authority from acting to demand compliance with the law," Kala says.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project in which the public procurement laws of these two countries were compared.
What was the concrete question?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation and a practice itself follow it.
We have gathered all this together and although this monitoring procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "more severe and of better quality", however, according to certain parameters, practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continuously develop more and more detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote itself to the very implementation of the law.
How can this project help you concretely and what does it result for you?
A common control of this kind should contribute precisely to the end of our efforts to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and any criminal activity.
But lowering market thresholds will not necessarily achieve this goal.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by red tape that those who seek its faults will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there an institution similar to our SAI or a different method of organization?
As far as the institutions, like the SAI, operate there the Bundesrechnungshof which is organised similarly, it also has a council constituted a little differently, but these two institutions basically proceed in a similar way .
The competences are also, to a certain extent, similar, however, with a nuance in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has such courses of accounts at the level of the various Länder.
The ORH can only control federal money, which corresponds to the resources of the state.
The public funds managed at home by the regions and the municipalities, are controlled there at the level of the Länder's accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it does better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better detectives?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I don't have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we regard as a model, is also facing a whole range of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has been meant for you, as an institution, by the amendment of the law on public procurement, has its effect already been felt?
As this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our control operations.
As we carry out post-checks, we have to count with a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the time being, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument to "detect the risks of mismanagement" with which we have screened nearly 14 000 public contracts - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions for certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law to be a benefit or an additional burden for the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulations, the provider (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the contract law meant a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal mistakes without consequences for the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what's the solution to get out of this?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the SDO was not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect and demanding compliance with the law.
He can say: "We will change the law and allow it", but he can't say that we're going to act as if nothing was happening.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, precisely in order to protect the tendering process.
But it is also tragic that a bidder should be eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that, in my opinion, is what is lacking in us.
Roads are frozen in places, but most of them are still workable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snow-covered.
However, the network remains largely feasible, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary area, roads were practical this morning, but in frozen areas and also snow-covered.
Temperatures have fallen and fluctuate between -5 ° and -10 °C but are expected to rise slightly during the day.
Snowfalls stopped in the area and only a thin layer of snow remained on the plains.
The ridges of the Metalliferous Mountains (Krušné hory) are, however, covered by about 30 centimetres of snow.
Data from the Regional Road Maintenance Service indicate that due to fog, visibility was reduced in some places.
The R6 high-speed road and the region's national roads are now easily accessible.
However, vigilance is still needed, for example on certain bridges whose surfaces can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third category routes, including mountain roads, are also feasible.
Remnants of frozen snow and in traffic-tackled areas remain on some of their sections.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to be more vigilant.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové regions
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some East Bohemian roads are threatened by ice formation and that snow layers filled with traffic can be found on roads in mountainous areas and at altitudes.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in areas of the Pardubice area at altitude.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoke Mýto, mainly on departmental and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Knánou and Trutnov, a layer of traffic-tackled snow is present on roads in areas above sea level.
In Eastern Bohemia, the weather will be dry today, most often clear, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will generally oscillate between -3 ° and +1 °C.
Pilsen region
Roads in the Pilsen area are now feasible, although in some places there is a need for increased vigilance and adaptation to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures fluctuate between -3 ° and -9 °C.
After the last snowfall and subsequent cooling, some routes of communication may be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to cross areas of fog, however, visibility will gradually improve.
This is reflected in the information provided by the Regional Road Maintenance Service.
The D5 motorway is almost easy to operate, but road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between km 80 and km 131.
The surface of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the South Pilsen District and in the Tachov District.
The departmental and third category lanes are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on less frequented roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc region
Drivers travelling to areas of the Olomouc region at altitude must now count with a thick and soft layer of snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the pass known as "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský k
Snowfalls forced road maintenance personnel to go to the field this night; according to the road services, it fell more than three centimetres in the Šumperk district.
In the other parts of the region, most pavements are accessible without difficulty.
" On the heights of the Šumperk district are snow remains.
Drivers travelling in the direction of Jeseník should expect to meet a thick, soft layer of snow at the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" pass," the head of road maintenance services in the Šumperk district told ČTK today.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also visited the area during the night; according to them, after chemical treatment, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc roads are easy to use, however in the district of Šternberk drivers should pay attention in sections in forest areas to roads that remain wet.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
This morning, the maintenance services of the northern Bohème roads reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some areas covered by snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, and therefore snow and ice are expected to remain on the roads. In the plains, especially south-east of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there are, on the contrary, no problems and roads are generally dry.
No traffic problems have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice, particularly in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snowmelt during the day, clear sky and freezing during the night.
From the main traffic routes, difficult conditions are also reported on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees which have bent under the weight of the snow until reaching the pavement.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
It's just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh at it rather and we think that we are the only group able to collect a positive energy balance in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you set up a very unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
It is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end almost as the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island, which is in the Pacific Ocean, on a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who had that idea?
Initially I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world entitled "End of the World Cancelled" (in Czech "Konec světa zrušeno").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will it also be heard at these charity concerts?
Of course, at the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all performers in all three concerts.
The anthems will also join at some point in a live, quite unique, Czech television show.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tom+ Hanák who also plays the main role of Jesus in the music video, Xindl X also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize numerous concerts and charity events...
We strive to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world be?
To equip the Studeo training centre, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on as part of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedličkūv Institute and offer them activities that interest them and amuse them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to courses, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Several music groups and performers will perform at each of these concerts?
By what criteria did you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustrator with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji
Full details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega-events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the Prague Spring; here too, we will surely prepare a quality programme with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the Czech Republic's house in New York and personally, once there in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimal, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not that bad that it looks at first sight.
We have five members in an electric chair whose vehicles have to travel in hold, of course we also trimbal lots of luggage and boxes of instruments....
So far everything has gone more or less well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, from where we came back recently, everything happened without problems.
With your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that in the east is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to move alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there, too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities is being created.
How do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements are always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
It is still not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers among us.
For the time being, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this band?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And since I myself am a musician (I play, among other things, saxophone), together with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Lúa Angelovič says, we lost a little control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I'm not mistaken?
It's true that building ties with known singers and actively working to promote the band helped us.
We understood that, if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to the European Union's grants, we can also afford to have quality teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of stuff that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts for a long time.
Few are the original projects, and I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it's natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take pity.
They are people who can live a life in their own right and flourish, provided they have the necessary means, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities can achieve something, it is not just a step forward for them but for the whole of society.
Is your success not also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and demand some discipline.
But I think it's quite normal.
Some people arrive at home with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, L·a Angelovič.
We're an open group, people go in and out, we can't help it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, Brno in Fleda and Ostrava in the Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relay when the song of the band The Tap Tap "End of the World canceled " will be sung together.
The purpose of the concert is to gather financial resources (up to CZK 25 million) to equip the multifunctional training centre Studeo which is located in Prague in the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years old, presale tickets are open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as a twentieth member of the Agency, it is the second member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and in subsequent years participated in a number of Agency projects.
However, the road from Poland to space began much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles worked on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, A. Šternfeld's lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, at which he presented ideas from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr.Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his book "Introduction à l'astronautique".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagator of the world-renowned astronautic, his contribution was rewarded in particular by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the Moon.
As early as 1925, a train was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket should be used to propell or brake the draisin.
The only known information about this draisine is that of the press of the time.
Starting in 1933, Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was carried out by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
The records show that this research had reached the testing stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search stopped.
In 1937, plans for a photoelectric hunting rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all plans for the use of rocket technology were led by the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war put an end to its activities.
After the war, further work on aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, one company is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the Problem newspaper, which contains four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to Astronautics
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the international Astronautical Federation (created in 1951) and as early as autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This 1800-metre range rocket was 80 cm long and weighed just under 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version, RM-1A, was built, and during the summer of 1959, two-stage RM-2 rocket flight tests were started in the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded the first RM rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B, and -1C) were developed; they distinguished themselves by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B it was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C it was 0.62 litres.
The maximum range of all these types of gear was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the Aeronautical Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were later built.
Mention should also be made of Poland's entry into the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the Miroslaw Hermaszewski pilot became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this programme.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision raised a lively debate in public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means in concrete terms that the different economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour prices (wages) give rise to price pressure.
The following meaning must be put to the end: a producer tries to resist economic competition by importing low-priced goods by making the competitor's price "more expensive", with the aim of removing a greater share of the market and thus increasing its own profits.
On a large scale, this means that most entrepreneurs either transfer production abroad or buy at low prices or disappear. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social and hence no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the State's social security contributions are necessarily increasing.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of businessmen to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
Unscrupulous practices of private capital create a situation in the different economies in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to their homes.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to existing laws.
The aim is to compel its own population economically to accept the diktat of private capital prices, particularly in the area of wages.
This is due, on the one hand, to a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, to the restriction of employees' rights in the field of labour legislation.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, for years there have been public food distribution points for the poor who cannot support themselves with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the state is forced to pay a supplement so that they reach the minimum subsistence level.
Such a scandal has, for example, been brought up to date in the case of employees working as auxiliaries to the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all the Member States of the southern EU undoubtedly create a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century) or to live with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
The question here is: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will change from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media argue that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly supports the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory intervention.
We must then ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence and, even, does not control today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the entire state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that due to the lack of financial resources, the national ministries delegate the drafting of legislation to law firms closely linked to the industry.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
The totality of power does not come from the people, as Western-style constitutions say, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberalist democracies are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Time of Caesar and Pompey": "The state had long been in disrepair and functions were attributed by violence.
The bribes, the favours obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The lower-tables and corruption would proliferate without limits and the people would go to the elections with votes already sold" ... ... "The honest people were not looking for office, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls". ... "It was really beginning to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man" ... It is true that Appianos had in mind Pompey, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interest of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and promoting the interests of society as a whole.
Today, as in the past, the result is a decadence without previous elites, without any effort to carry out profound reforms.
We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the present state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises we witness today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them in ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international level and at the European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen the State's capital investment in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will," says Sting in the song called Fragil whose main verse of the refrain is "let's not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be war," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, there have been many reactions.
Some take Israel's side, asserting its right to self-defence and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and treating Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in his waves of recurrent killings; all in all, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view "behind the curtain", on the one to which benefit mainly from the tensions that have already persisted for more than 95 years (as of the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others emerge from my own understanding of the one, or more precisely of the group of individuals, which is the principal instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At each time, we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individualities acted independently or whether they owed their actions to the throne to someone who directed their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We have to admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration that generates certain powers could not be achieved in a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
From the 1990s of the 19th century, they acquired the first global news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their names and serious criminal acts in which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortune or both.
They have major holdings in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only of 4, in the meantime Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of a central bank to the Bank of America of the Rothschild and began to issue his own money during the civil war (I understand that government) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to sue the EDF for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The purpose of the first war was to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to suppress colonialism, especially British colonialism, and the third was to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and ultimately acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with the Rothschild at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to prevent crises such as those they caused in 1907 from recurring).
After having succeeded in triggering the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir Habsburg to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers allowed politicians to create a latent conflict situation: on the one hand, they imposed enormous war reparations on Germany, thus generating the conditions for radicalisation of the impoverished masses (it is then enough for them to place a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing at the guilty, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia made up of different nationalities, including a strong German minority which was to play the role (which it actually held) of the fifth column to set fire to the powders and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had broken the chains in which the international bankers had originally held him; or if everything he had done was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel lit up a fire pit that could cause a third world war.
If the international bankers manage to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong causes another wrong according to an endless circle of violence and where, at the origin of everything, there is the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
Here we have to make a difference between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as with us, international bankers only propose to people in elections their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything possible to trigger a war with Iran, which could, because of that country's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz through which 20% of all world oil flows (this naval corridor is only 2 miles wide) and causes destruction of the world economy.
In what light now appears the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of finance aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every new born is implanted at birth an electronic chip making it a totally controlled being.
"Let them compel all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to carry on the hand or forehead a mark with red iron, so that he may neither buy nor sell anyone who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that he who has common sense counts the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number refers to the man and it is six hundred and sixty six."
The Argo movie: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist students stormed the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the American administration a positive outcome, it could not abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, further aggravated by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The sequestered diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate in the United States created a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iranian debacle strongly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered America a small victory.
Just before she was busy, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated events, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran with a rocky cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who came to make scouts for the shooting of a science fiction film.
Genre combination
The plan of the expert in exfiltration Tony Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
On the one hand, it is a political thriller conceived in a realistic way but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful blow, of a treachery - like, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, Twelve and Thirteen.
The atmospheres follow each other: documentary-style Tehran sequences (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and the way in which, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no great differences),
lighter Hollywood passages, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
And then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting game stopped generating ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark police officer "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It's also Affleck's first film that doesn't take place in his home town, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where Tehran's role "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity which also suggests confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in fictional scenes (the fake shooting team in Tehran's bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to settle for a subject that actually offered few thrilling scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
He is doing very well, he sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is ruled out by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the airstrip is quite drawn by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have deserved a larger place and they are not, far from that, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he lets himself be seen with moderate interest, enjoying the realization and retro style of the 70's.
It leads the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story still, in a certain way, unfinished to date, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the job.
Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry into the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU has recently planned to adopt a quota of 40 per cent of women for the management of large European companies has been at the root of our decision," said the press freedom organisation, Patrik Nacher, for the Právo newspaper.
Among the absurdities mentioned are already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, however, women have been advantaged in terms of life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lesser risk to insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013", informed Nacher.
Among the controversial EU regulations are, for example, the requirement to add organic components to fuels, which has adverse environmental consequences, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, solely because they contain a relatively small amount of a hazardous substance, or the Directive on the size of hens' cages, which has led to an increase in egg prices.
Criticism has also been expressed in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter to spread" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of states (for example, the Czech Republic is currently imposing the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto power).
The interests of pressure groups are also at the root of the fact that bananas in the Union must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curve".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonising non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite opposition from some States, claiming that the existing directives result in a waste of food.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to last year's EU Regulation which requires a warning on inflatable balloons that children under the age of 8 must not inflate without adult surveillance.
The EU referred to an American survey according to which balloons are, among toys, the leading cause of death of children by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when blowing in fair trumpets.
We have some weird ideas in our house too.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this topic to Greece, anyone with an official position in the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and should instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the "Let Do" association of liberal economists, has named in this survey, in addition to certain absurdities mentioned above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food supplies that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then, for example, removed the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and, as a result, risked a heavy fine.
The organisers of this survey found it interesting to pay money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and to grant a grant to apply for grants.
These ideas, however, are not from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea handicaps us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund." Thus, in autumn 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) spoke.
He argued that, as a result of our wheat production, and as a result of so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks that it had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to Czech demand and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for grants were proposed to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which were to be used in concrete terms to prepare applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "Weird regulations are rare".
While the regulations often give rise to criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the field of its general development are rather commendable.
More serious, for example, is, according to experts, the problem of using EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which were imposed by the Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a struggle that it does not always win) arouses strong emotions among Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvar+ky", for what of the name "Tuzemský rum" that dates back to us in the nineteenth century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, not beet sugar, may bear the name rum.
The official list of EU registered products now includes world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, Karlovy Vary biscuits ("Karlovarské Suchary"), Pohořelice and Třeboř carp ("Pohořelický a Třebořský kapr") and Žatec ("Žatecký chmel") hops.
Pardubice's gingerbread ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Cornets de Hořice" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their Community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Senator, how does it feel to stand in the presidential elections?
It's not being a senator or chair that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn't be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer stand to see how the country has been looted for the last twenty years, that thieves are not under lockdown and taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I'm trying to figure out a way for it to change.
And since I am more than forty years old and I am independent, a member of no party, I have no other options to influence the situation than to run for office in the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but quickly set off for the Castle (N.d.T.: seat of the Presidency).
Don't you turn your back on those who elected you?
I've always said that I'll go into the battle for the Castle according to the results of the senatorial elections.
Subsequently, I indicated that if I was elected as a senator, I would run for office in the presidential election.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument for me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the widest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we grumble at the bar or in front of our television station, but it is also that we trample on those who are trying to bring about change.
To this is added the press that breaks people's reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was told that I bribed journalists or that I was the counselor of Ji ' Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You have begun the fight for the Castle with as a battlehorse the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax declarations beyond twenty million [of CZK].
To that end, you must change the law.
As Speaker, you do not have such a power and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I lobbied for tourism guide activities to be a liberal profession, I won.
The problem is politics: when someone arrives from the left or right with a good project, it is deliberately refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
You think you're a man of the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are putting me on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we're moving forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right, but that people are gathered together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I also act impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a business, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have talked about them.
But without the support of parliament, you have only slogans left.
You will not survive long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I must convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my side in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then eventually explain why they don't want it.
When there is a strong personality who will identify abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the election of the president by direct suffrage, it was obtained thanks to pressure from public opinion.
I confess, without amazement, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I've just started politics and I'm trying to get the majority support for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can't make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities and asked them to run for office in the Senate election as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed oil fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty per cent of the people did not vote and what did, for the most part, gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that will hardly be able to impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Do you intend to found your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I don't have any money for my presidential campaign either, I only have twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property at about 60 million.
I have in Prague a plot worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid's dream: I've always loved James Bond, who was driving, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You drive in Aston Martin, you have a 60 million worth of wealth and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I've already invested two and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program does not attract much interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign in my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live with it, for example, paying my son's English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I won't run for election.
So you're going to continue your commercial activities so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd be deafening your activities?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take over the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I was winning and I keep winning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I'd end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV firm prove that the real adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To be convinced of this, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in a large neighboring company, tells us: "Yes, it is indeed beautiful, this building".
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one goes of their own free will to one of these ringuard libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping town that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brains, the city decided a few years ago to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro notes in the form of pretty small miniatures of painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city's authorities realized that there was only one way to take control of statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, of the architect's office in Rotterdam MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of buildings full of mind and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and presented himself to the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a ricination on the face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at each other, disconcerted and shrugging their shoulders, Maas, beating him, stacked his choice books in order of size to make them a pyramid, and ended his speech supported by militant arguments by a: "common heart!"
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the €30 million mountain sprang from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a few adjoining buildings and houses for a total of 50 dwellings.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, this dull little town, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a town hall of a staggering ugliness, whose white facades invite to think that they are home to a dairy, has been enriched by a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Certainly, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open to you when you walk the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and the elegant reverbers speak unequivocally the language of the municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We're already looking at public benches, dogs and little boys and girls playing ball.
And all over books, books, and more books.
"Normally, the library shelves are located along the façade and in the middle there is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," explains Willy Maas.
We completely changed the classical spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from inside to outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been skillfully designed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the centre for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes panelling, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircase ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the hardened building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in Spijkenisse municipality, in response to the Standard.
One day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in a Frisian farm.
In the Netherlands, for years synthetic membranes of one millimetre thickness have been used as substrates in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and you save time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into four centimetres thick plates.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and potted ficus.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the new soul
"It's incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in the field of ecology," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is controlled by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only illuminates the interior for a short time, even on days of fine weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted across the glass façade serve as a sunshield, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
Fully automated blinds handle the rest.
Stefan Spemron, the above-mentioned septic computer scientist, has already ventured to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig too was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as "the soul finally recovered" from Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his or her personal library.
This has made it possible to fill the voids of the library which was not yet fully stocked (today, it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has achieved the master discipline called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
Even though she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role."
Germany chose abstention in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on relations between the US and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request for observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must exercise caution, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but was not too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 insurgency in Libya, Germany also chose to abstain in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany find it difficult to take a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so to speak defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore clashed with several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to find this role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
What, then, does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for the Germans?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions that are independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany first has important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to clash with public opinion, but also with the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a determining factor.
However, I would not place too much emphasis on it, because it is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is at least a determining factor in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany undermine its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I believe that the fracture is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States has announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do the views differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing a great deal of understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the true differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you observe the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm for Netanyahu's policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think it makes things easy for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore fit within a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
That is what they are doing now on the issue of the euro.
In my view, Germany will assume a role as a locomotive in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been a delicate one.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that is more important to their independence.
Does Germany see itself as an important player on the international stage, does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or does she still have difficulties taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still has difficulties playing a more important role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make things easy for the Germans.
In fact, it's always the same problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to deal with a wide variety of neighbours and opinions, and it's not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only diminishing, but at the moment the EU does not fill this void, so who remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant and if they're less appreciated, it's life!

"Trademark Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is an officially registered trademark in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys protection such that the undertaking bearing its name cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, it is not certain that she would win the case.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, lawyer for Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in violation of property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators need only a few additional letters to register their trademarks.
So instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet in which the registrations made at the Beijing Trademark Office are located.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company filed the trade mark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become world champions of copying and infringement of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping centres that sell virtually only counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his constituents instruct him to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are designated.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame for.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," demands Pattloch.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation is enormous."
The financial losses and legal costs are in millions for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to expensive flagship products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest growing one.
However, it is not easy to remove questionable registrations from the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch refers to the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time the name criticized had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist because he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the builder of the Sany construction machine, the same company that had just bought the producer of Putzmeister concrete pumps.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's acquirer, used before a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW's. The conflict was settled and Geely had to modify it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the plagiarists of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO trademark office in Beijing admits to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office would have passed last year from an "emergency situation in the course of work to a recovered normality".
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22%.
Almost 57,000 such cases were reportedly closed, an increase of 75% over the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 proceedings remain outstanding at the Office.
It's expensive to act
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the Board, this is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office would have recorded 1.8 billion yuan of registration fees.
In other words, each record has averaged 1.280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
Of course, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
"It's our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," says Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office had therefore rejected the objection of the Munichers.
Freudenberg has certainly won the case in the following two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is on the table.
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "the procedure is long, difficult and we cost a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to estimate internal costs. The archives department has even had to review the actions of the last 100 years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg had even unsuccessfully proposed to the opposing party a "big six-digit euro amount" to settle the dispute.
"This is what we see for us," Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East threaten even to overflow into Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region were to ensure the exploitation of unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to register Freudenberg in Germany for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "vigilance is in order."
Pattloch and advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, in their view, to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should rather "register also in China everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, costs may be much higher than registration costs.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of its legal drama, the company would have to pay licence fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place in the segment of the market in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland rejoice at their arrival.
This is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we hit the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, ladies' skirmishes and men's moccasins look for the rhythm by hitting the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers grow slowly - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they get carried away, bewitch and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lost his canvas shoes when he led the orchestra with his wildly flexible gestures.
We are Monday night, the Imbongi choir repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years of age have come, from geneticist in human medicine to man in the home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, every singer has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
To be helped to help each other
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are living with the disease.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected persons.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany through the "Voices for Africa" association.
70 of them attend secondary schools.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a godfather.
This money guarantees the child money for the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the Gogo centre.
Imbongi means in Zulu "story teller" or even "singer of praise".
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this area, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany to return it to its native region: South Africa.
For at 8,733 kilometers as the bird flies from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of straw or land and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, for HIV has taken away their parents.
In Esitjeni, we can observe on a smaller scale the ills afflicting Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population is infected with the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in spring 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis mainly saw many children on the street who were not only lacking parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
At first, they were just a few people who personally committed themselves to paying a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since been dealing almost professionally with the AIDS orphans of Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and blennorrhea (or gonorrhea).
Common STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The pubic lice and scab belong to parasitic STIs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhea often occur in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany result in sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections are among young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany, human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the trend in the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure has risen from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one-tenth over the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white loss, pain in the lower abdomen as well as the appearance of buds and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through lubricating infection or close body contact.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who changes sexual partners often take regular exams.
Most rapidly tested STIs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds that the singers collect thanks to their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
She also ensures that orphans are well housed, for example, in one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, so called the old Zulu women, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them host up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and ensure that they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is accommodated in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare daily meals for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chicken coops. With the help of the American health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many inhabitants.
This is not self-evident, because even if the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's a subject that affects sexuality."
It's quite curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned customs, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
However, condoms are found in every corner of the street," adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to encourage some cultural exchange, Imbongi's choirs travel together every two or three years to the South of Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still know during the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in the African language is a sign of recognition such that it not only generates good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears out a tear from a few fearsome border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the choirs visit their godson.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you'll find light there," people say.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometers as a bird flies, back to Heidelberg, in front of those singers who hit foot in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Straße, there is also light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could be 20 metres thick.
The American Space Agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of an ice cover in the world's ever-dwelling area.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimetres up to 20 metres.
The water probably comes from comets or maybe from asteroids that might have hit Mercury.
However, no one links the discovery of water to the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other life-critical elements have arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Unseen of the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like small interstices through which one observes infinity.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "new-born" in the delivery room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where stars, called "W5", are born, a name not very romantic, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flamboyant glow of a star dying.
The donut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when she dies.
In the huge trifide nebula, at 5,400 light years of the Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
Pleiades, clusters of stars also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope enhances colour.
In this infrared photo, the nebula of Helice, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
His similarities with a land continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest riddles in astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving any traces.
One of the largest and brightest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
Depending on the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the trifide nebula in the Sagittarius constellation, several thousand light-years away.
Trifide's name comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), for three dust drags divide the glowing heart of the place of birth of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation of the Serpentaire: at 400 million light years of the Earth, the nuclei of two molten galaxies rush towards each other, collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Southern Fire Wheel".
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a detail of the Iris nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light years away and consists of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than the common domestic dust.
This photo was developed from optical and radiographic photographs taken by different telescopes.
It shows the circle of black holes at 430 million light-years from the Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the Rosette nebula, also constantly create young stars at 5,000 light years from the Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists think he was born shortly after bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our View of the Universe: The Main Telescopes
The telescope was allegedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image was five metres in diameter.
In Arizona, in the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also attached to the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great ability to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help with the "Search for Extraterrestral Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by using the computing power of their machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take photographs until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 metres each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory which observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A huge new telescope is also expected to be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 metres.
This illustration makes it possible to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble space telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, he has been giving us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space as soon as possible in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
The telescope's mission will be to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that Mercury's South Pole is also home to ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this theory, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury's North Pole.
Radar data for decades indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
With the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the Bible patriarchs.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the Bible patriarchs.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is a long romantic journey.
At the turn of the many turns of the road, the small bus cahoots along forested hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, it's almost like the Black Forest.
But here we are in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group, called Talysh, lives, about which we do not know much, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azeri and that they have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plastrons with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not at all agree with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel 323 kilometres, because the road has only one lane.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, 48-year-old Pilata Fatulayeva is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Bakou became famous in May with the help of Eurovision, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world here," explains Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, the only museum of this kind in the world.
We can discover the lives of about eight dozen Talysh of the region who are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather. He's 120 years old.
Have one more child at 136 years
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when one thinks that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems more than dubious.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a daughter.
Would Şirali Müslümov have been wrong for a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of man in the great age of Central Asia.
"Amazingly old people also live in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz explains, "in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the lack of documentation, and there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
It is, however, true that people in the Lerik area often reach an age worthy of the Bible patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
What, then, is the reason for longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have special genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the museum director, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who like meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At age 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a baritone, whose contents she beat tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two little kids smack in the house too.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical Armadus glasses in the shape of a belly.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf hide long braids of a dark blond that his son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and they kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never bought any food in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda is surprising in an old lady's mouth.
However, the cult of the fatherly figure of the nation, a man who has led his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, after which his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any event, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not experience distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats a month (about the same amount as in euros) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-grey son is right: "The elders enjoy great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "human rights" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
rival demonstrations reveal the deep divide of the country.
The draft constitution based on sharia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian President is not staggering with words filled with emotion.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was intended for the entire people, but especially for Christian Copts, Liberals, enlightened Muslims and lay people.
Because all members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost on his apologies, that he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 hastily written articles by the majority Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour night power tower are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that case law is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
This was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists will use the vague formulation and the resulting legal room for manoeuvre to apply a stricter interpretation of sharia law.
In any case, it is suggested that a newly introduced article stating that, with regard to all matters relating to Shariah, al-Azhar University should be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance shines throughout the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will supervise the legislature, which would de facto lead to the guardianship of the judiciary.
Many points in the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts tried to repress opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, as the project says, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that State institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
In short, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, there is no specific article that guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a cartoon of the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a man of law?
There are therefore many points for interpretation in the draft which Morsi put to the vote and which, according to his own words, will "very soon" be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution Reborns"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual harmony on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring the sharia down before it came into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the trash of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to foment a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," exclaimed Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned", said Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its nullity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of Cairo University.
The veiled women and the supporters of the Salafists, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, claiming that "the Qur'an [was their] Constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tharir Square, where everything began, would soon have led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, this is what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that opponents of the draft Constitution, along with its supporters, had spoken loudly.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot box on the direction the country must take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process, which should have lasted until February and encompass all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or before the courts under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights were indivisible.
That is why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant breaches of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto takes away all his powers," Saeda deplores.
Yet democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, who looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could be paid for.
A protester on Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway's rakfisk: is it the most fragrant fish in the world?
The five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to local appetite for an extremely fragrant fish?
Have some advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty soccer clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can last up to a year.
When the darkness settles and it's cold, Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," explains Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter who is also known as "Rakfisk General", responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people get small pieces of fish and a lot of drink.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," Havard adds.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it's not bad - it reminds you of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in airtight water barrels, then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, when well fermented, the fish came out and - without a doubt with the senses diminished by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so much richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital though smelling element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to displease it.
Here, people are unwilling to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about the "July 22 incident."
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country one of them may have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has owed its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the unique reason for our success," explains Anna, our waitress, with blonde hair and the eyes of a piercing blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk tray by hand.
We are - how do you say - cautious people.
His English, like most people who live here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw money out of the window, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep its purse tight.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Not to mention the rakfisk," she adds in a carefree laughter.
I stand under the snow and line up to buy something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a burger made of elk, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I stay in is one of many places where we serve rakfisk for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most fragrant of them.
There's a TV show where the presenter wears a papillon knot, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It's like the Eurovision contest.
"What score did you give the best fish in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls out of his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of fish fumes.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, is interested in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, which are many.
Road traffic in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In a town where traffic jams are usually legion, a safety dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the objective was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, with results from outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the midst of a drug war that has already cost the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Pena Nieto was Governor of the State of Mexico before he met with the American President.
A densely populated and sprawling state that engulfs the capital. On its favourite land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic commune of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises attribute it to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once bumped and full of crevasses.
Plates bearing its name are hung outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to bring about lasting change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and the party of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejected the critics of the opponents who reproached the new president for lack of charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he can listen.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more obvious.
Hidden under the automonts of the highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military were called to the rescue to fight the drug gangs in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, the bodies of dozens of women who have been murdered in the past two years have been found on the edge of the dump.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's critics say that, at best, he failed to stem the problem of murders against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality face to face.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version refers to a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says the Señora Buendia.
Signs indicated that it had been beaten, and cadaveric rigidity was already initiated.
As her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana dresses up the wall, next to a cross where the word: Justice appears.
However, this is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old gossiper, a troublemaker, a whineer.
They want us to accept what they say and shut up.
"But it's not normal for there to be so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised that he will make it his priority during his term of office.
"I hope he will be as good as he was when he was governor," Olvera told Congressman Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, state the prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning allegedly suffered during detention.
The trial concerns Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to close the case on the grounds that Manning's sequestration took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of causing the biggest leak of confidential information in the entire history of the U.S. Army -- has missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein claimed that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a motion requiring that the Manning case be closed on the grounds that the detention was carried out under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified that he wanted to commit suicide while in detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
During the Friday hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after meeting with Manning, during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment his guards had given him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had had in the prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not mention any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers interviewed him directly about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about certain problems orally and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the problems mentioned.
"They wrote "no problem" (after addressing the concerns), and yet it did not mean that I had not raised any problems," Manning said.
Military judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military stated that they assigned this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for its protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was okay, and I wanted to be removed from my status... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison of the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he had considered suicide while in Kuwait and had fainted once because of the heat.
He added that not knowing what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning stated that he had spent the most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items at his disposal were mattresses, blankets, flip-flops, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or lying down during the day was contrary to the rules.
Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so that he could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation in his Thursday testimony -- that after being forced to sleep naked overnight in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to be naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the appeal.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning stated that he had inferred from the order of his guard that he should release his cover that might have hidden his nakedness, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to release it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the night before, as he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning allegedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or flip-flops to hurt himself, but that he had not done so.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he experienced during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is to be found guilty before a court martial, a trial that should be held early next year.
The defence has stated that Manning is considering pleading guilty to the least serious crimes and fighting for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, illegal publication of information on the Internet, and transmission of national defence information.
If all charges are brought against him, he shall be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says Mexico-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two routes: one for "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), and another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I remained motionless for several seconds, not knowing which line to lead me to.
I grew up in central California, where I've been called the Mexican all my life.
This is an ethnic qualifier, just like the one my Boston friends use when they say "Irish," or my New York friends when they say "Italian."
Then I became Mexican-American.
But, here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that saw my grandfather born, there is no need for any special qualifier or line of union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to manage an interview in either language.
But I don't have native vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed for the "foreigner" line.
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favourite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risking themselves in the United States.
He wants to join forces in the United States and Canada, and create a Union for Trade like the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to hand over half of their territory to the point of the gun in writing.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and no minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as an official U.S. casts any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans violate their neighbour's sovereignty.
And Montezuma's kids are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer.
The only reason that explains the great number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, did not find any opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, have gone to good schools and have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that this is the American dream we are living, not the Mexican dream.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is evident.
We grant it to the United States.
On the other hand, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
Feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they hold us as if we were inferior individuals and not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we wouldn't find ourselves stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexico Americans, because Mexicans more firmly claim their identity and Mexico Americans are upset about it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels like she is part of two countries.
On the other hand, many Mexico Americans I know don't feel like they're part of one country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexico Americans to work as makeshift ambassadors to Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
It won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the pervasive wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to take care of yourself, amigos.
That's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexico Americans always blame them for the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there never be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is in vain.
While the same futile arguments persist as to who started, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has caused everything to be shattered, and whether we like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify even further.
Yet there is every reason to believe that this could help them to break this deadly impasse.
A war that doesn't make any losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Even though the ceasefire granted on 21 November continues, this week's fighting has reinforced the supporters of force on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has been leading Gaza since 2007, will boast of forcing Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza has been beaten.
Having killed some of its leaders and pushed the 1.7 million people of Gaza into one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals in Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might think that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a booming regional power, once the Muslim ally closest to Israel, has taken a stand for Hamas; as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states of the Gulf.
Hamas members jubilate and say that the growing Islamicist is bowing around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where Hezbollah's militia exercises its domination, through Syria, where Islamist-oriented rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas' allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders rely more easily on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel's hard line will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put back in a box.
The Iron Dome missile interception system has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America reiterates its unfailing support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being the source of the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although rocket fire from Gaza has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared from suicide bombings, including through the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality under international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose party Likud merged with an even more belligerent party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the election on 22 January, has the beautiful part.
Why are these damn Palestinians pampering by giving them a condition?
If they were heading the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they get their heads out.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will prevail; but the Arab spring may change the situation.
Even if Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to secure a ceasefire, which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel — a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains that advocated by the reasonable people on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to stop the flow of weapons to Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with exchanges of ground and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal for a pseudo-state in the United Nations.
Obama also has every interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for Neutral Cigarette Packages came into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of brand
This law came into force in Australia as a world first, the logos and colors were replaced by a dark olive green and horrible photos of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to deter youth from smoking by eliminating glamour.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have revealed, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on multinational profits, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers stated that this would boost the black market, which will make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
"There will be adverse consequences from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others stated that this law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, stated that the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has increased sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in the high court of Australia.
Ha stated that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only trouble, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the segment of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting commercials on TV, sports sponsorship and the obligation of retailers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and have only a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the best place to go," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some lambda citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves whether this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry is focused on the new regulations in force rather than on marketing.
Industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries have told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in 2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and put the package away," said Victor El Hage when buying a package with a tumor picture of the mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'll be arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in central Sydney, said the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on displays.
"Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government only had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's okay, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising the arms to heaven.
In a world that is constantly connected, it may be good to be bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during Thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the issue of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in child development praise boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to be bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, even to nourish creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the open-armed boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll come back to it.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The trouble goes back a long way," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they go back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and discussed, in various ways, said John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After going through many publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consisted of "to want to do something, but not to get involved in a satisfactory activity."
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although he or she would like to do so.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the process of attention, associated with a gloomy mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
The boredom can be very much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while both can be related, bored people tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the next room, the too high sound of a TV show that had no connection, others just heard the TV show, and the third group didn't hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low noise level said that they had become more bored than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this concentration problem to boredom.
When you try to focus on a challenging or challenging task, a break in attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "like looking at objects on a editing chain, music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when you twist or scratch, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to giggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay unmoved," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Scale of Predisposition to Trouble" in the 1980s.
The scale includes assertions like, "Among the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and in particular need numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blasphemed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of adolescents reported bored at school and while homeworking at home, while 23 per cent reported bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 per cent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether today's boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents don't have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: Is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"Entity is the way the brain found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at the N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't get bored anymore, but he won't have learned to take care of himself or self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation changes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, he gets more mastery of himself in other fields.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant excitement generated by activities and technology is the goal we should strive for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this.
"We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it's hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his condition: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco stated that one day, in September, he and a few friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons to appear for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his use - minor offences, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr Orozco.
But is it one of them?
During the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado's vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences involving the use of marijuana have been dismissed.
The police have stopped charging adults 21 years of age and older for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative ridings have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to charge those who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana shops in their neighbourhoods.
"Things are moving so fast that I don't know what the future holds for us," said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora Chief of Police, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators are also asking a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidance on how to install a licensing system, allowing for production, manufacture, distribution and sale - before the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most states in the area of marijuana regulation, first with respect to therapeutic use and now with respect to personal use.
" Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith admits, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves," he said.
The Washington law, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, during which the licensing system will still not exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal.
In the meantime, practical issues remain unresolved: how to balance the mandate of the state which guarantees appropriate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales shops within a 30 km radius around a school, park, playground or crèche.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up a licensed cannabis sales business, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson for the cannabis legalization centre, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City Attorney" (representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office) would no longer prosecute persons 21 years of age or older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should cease charging persons for this type of "immediate" offence.
Chief Oates stated that the police would implement the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, the "district attorney", Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, primarily in order to pressure users to get detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are charged with other offences.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those persons who committed an offence that, at the time of the offence, was a recognized offence," said Mr. Buck.
Reactions have been complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative to restrict marijuana use.
The police at Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer summon adults for possession of limited quantities.
The representative of the county prosecutor's office, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to discontinue all marijuana detention cases.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time continuing to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and government framework for personal marijuana use is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different American cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with representatives of the Public Prosecutor's Office, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing people accused of marijuana use and speaking as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They spent much of their lives prosecuting people who used marijuana, so they find it hard to accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to treat the restricted use of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are about to become a case law case law for the legalization of drugs.
While defenders and government officials are planning a new legalized sales border, they are awaiting the direction of the federal government, which still sees the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will yield.
Despite some mediated arrests of therapeutic marijuana patients and vendors, the federal government has primarily allowed medical marijuana sales businesses to practice in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police are probably not going to break down the doors to seize small drug bags, there is a strong bet that they are opposed to licensed personal marijuana sales businesses authorized under the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political advisor to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments have approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales businesses, even if it is only a one-year carry-over.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a moratorium of 6 months, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
"We don't want to end up in a situation where a permit is given to someone and then we face a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mistreated and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not just today's students who are being attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me a prominent place to know, a kind of Greek amphitheater of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal in my life.
My father collapsed and began to cry.
My friends were confused.
The L'Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson said with a facety that I had left after being forced to drink in chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I had been subjected to intimidation and constant bullying.
Not because of my rather outspoken name, not because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one single reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behaviour: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential counsel to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about this today, you'll tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of centre-right students suffer the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Student Hall (JCR) stated that they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable" because of their political views.
They want to have a representative on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Wonderland: Young, Intelligent and Right"), devoted to student politics, which portrayed the "Tories" as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
In particular, the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who moves in Rolls-Royce, wears a silver complete and moves with a chromed head cane.
At other universities, conservative students claim to be treated as scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper "that there is a growing left-wing bias in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate was "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the UCA, said that there had been a deterioration in the attitude of the JCR members towards people who were centre-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one who thought that way during my first weeks at Oxford.
I entered September 1986, when I was 18 years old and of paralyzing shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted against granting Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was filled with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students met with the others and the professors, I had a taste of what would happen afterwards.
I discovered that teachers not only participated in sarcasms towards Tory students, but also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy on striker miners, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were engraved in the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm of which I was a victim was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a small man with a pustular face, was easily carried away.
"Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears were burning my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he said in a funny tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and then felt a slight slap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student, named James, who introduced himself as a member of the UCA.
"I know who you are," he said, nicely.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Any person suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be harder for you.
Most Tory youth claim to be Labour (workers).
Later, at the local pub, I loosely tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher had said.
This scheme failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political and economic science who, ironically, had studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students have taken over the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I have only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
Have I been forced to meet people who share the same points of view only after dark?
Should I have become Labour and denied my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only teacher openly Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his adherence to the Marxist-determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents' home in London, finding refuge with my more open-minded family and friends in town.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I told him why.
He was unbelieving.
During his studies in Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But this is the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreaming bell towers.
Even my communist friends had faultless ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a session of work conducted the following week, when another history teacher suggested most seriously in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Rumbling inwardly with shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and called them "old fools."
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who put the last nail in my oxfordian coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed in my room, and after five minutes, my chasers gave up.
When they left, I packed and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can call me a whining chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic was that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Prime Ministers Tory, but also enjoyed an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place of British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his sewing house over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the highlight of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there is an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, via Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascension: from the modest designer of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least they don't crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet as some pop music stars do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of the beauties of time such as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance over fame.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentinian model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charisma of the designer.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Square in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated", recalls the "top model", which started working with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He will never pass from fashion, because his creations are works of art," she concluded.
Parade of lineage of nobility
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He likes the very high people and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre wide podium that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to parade on the podium to admire a dream "public" carrying Valentino's main creations, such as Jackie Kennedy's tailor for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, Monica Vitti's costume in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Among these models are names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria and Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of her clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
These were pants, shirts, vests and jackets from the fall-winter 1971-72 collection.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to all others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimes our beauty," adds Feria's ex-duchess.
I really like the colors he uses, they're bright and light up the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashioner Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot, either, forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of being the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward of Line.
It was a red evening dress, with a flying skirt, a draped bustier and a cleavage to fall.
"It was a dream come true," said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the intemporel," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the evening dresses of the couturier with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that she carries".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the designer thus calls his seamstresses) to make this dress in ivory silk with inlays of pearls, twelve different kinds of laces and a four and a half meters long trail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the haute couture of the end of the twentieth century, "the return of the clients of the high society".
Obnominated for years by the "know-being" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani has as many honours as any spouse of her clients.
"His refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance have always jumped into my eyes," admits d'Arenberg.
Last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was impeccable, years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says it...
The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the porters of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by carrying the sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas emanating from the entrails of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After collecting large sulphur rocks, which weigh a total of nearly 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 meters up to the peak of the volcano that peaks at 2,386 meters above sea level, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a tortoise-like pace, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 euro cents for each kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once at the top, he made a way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and painfully carrying the heavy baskets, they walked the 3 kilometers to the scale that a mining company installed a little below at 1,850 meters of altitude.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) per kilo of sulphur.
She then sells it to 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euros) to the petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serves to whiten sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes him 3 hours and he finishes exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is the triple of what it would gain in the fields.
"The income of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)", says the bearer who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, her salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as the sulphur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and her eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life defying the danger on the Kawah ljen, but sulphur has already begun to charge him the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and her eyes are irritated by toxic gases released by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work for another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in an English that is more than acceptable.
Misled by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unhealthy wood massure with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because sulphur does not cease to spring at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater by lighting himself with a small lamp fixed to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the baskets of sulphur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own and are paid by weight.
Moreover, they also do not receive a sub of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) of increase per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), that the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protestes Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left college.
Able to carry up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which are obviously added their usual breathing problems, arthroses, pains in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on its back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometres away by a weed-infested goat trail.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says, opening his mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of her five children, aged 30, also works as a carrier of sulphur.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult jobs in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame this lack of children on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfil our civic duty and let us give life!
It may seem implausible that these words come from an advertisement for mint pellets, but despite that, or perhaps because of that, the video spread like a drag of powder on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's go put a polchinella in the drawer" to make fun of Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music so that people would fulfill "their national duty."
It is intended solely for the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt that it was a theme that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried a number of things like throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative but they did not necessarily work.
So we said to ourselves: what more creative to solve this problem than to make it a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singapore government does not take it so lightly.
He spends US$1,300 a year in politics to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favour of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its national population distribution, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2, considered the renewal rate, it was in 1976.
Why, then, do Singaporeans not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, says that this is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family building," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and delayed marriage and birth, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound only disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese who are accused of drawing wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's party has had its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as the shoebox, that can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the EL Developers real estate company, claims that its "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to developers, who were previously put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small housing units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new regulations may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by discussing with Singaporeans working in the central financial district, they do not seem to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, as is education, which is why people put it back to later," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it is important to be able to dispose of my money and my time," another young man, about twenty years old, tells us.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as reasons for preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government tries to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for those under 16 years of age?
How can this definition be applied in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share off-line?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, who were frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" personally with "password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
"I won't reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says ten-year-old Jorge when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I won't share one of my photos or someone who would make the fool," he said.
The young boy acknowledges that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked people, crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge assures that he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are family members.
Her mother is one of them, and she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends quickly," he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust someone who would recommend a stranger to him.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
"It doesn't worry me because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one made any advances or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If they put the pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today under the name of cyber-harassment are no stranger to the young boy.
A close friend of mine was ragged on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only put it in a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or angry.
"Even if I know it's cyber-harassment," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of searching for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras points out that academician Marc Prensky, who has a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are they, children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are learning ourselves," she says.
He added that the topic is complex, "because we ask them to have a definite criterion on what it is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or say at an age when they are not mature enough to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents confidentiality is to use questions that make them think.
"Their saying not to do it is useless," she says.
Then Porras lists some examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to publish a picture of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"In the Internet, everyone has to act with respect, morality and other principles, it has to be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and education counsellor, says it is essential that parents carefully read the conditions for using social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that we should not talk to foreigners.
The Unasur Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was announced earlier and theoretically adopted by the seven representatives present.
Efe has tried several times to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be disclosed after the closure of the summit, and then said that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian government's website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit has been constantly restricted.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The lack of information between journalists was the result of press officers from some of the Unasur governments who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were calling for more important information.
Later, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Summit of South America-Arab Countries (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although this was requested by the press, it had also not circulated the statement also known as the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited the gathering of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement between Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court which divided a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and stated that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleas of both parties in the Lima trial against Santiago, which begins on Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are bringing to this international court today," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of controversies, treaties and international tribunals," added President Piñera, giving a handshake to President Humala, next to the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia had denounced this week the Pact of Bogota by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua which it considered to be gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host President, Ollanta Humala, was instructed to open the proceedings in the morning and close the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read out the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action for 31 projects had been established between South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve “cooperation in combating urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters”.
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalistic matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to see a better future for our populations", concluded President Humala.
"We decided to focus on a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a speech.
Of these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were located on the transverse axes of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a larger connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide further details.
Similarly, the outcome document referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme discussed at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos, stated, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss calmly the maritime dispute through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogotá.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to revise all these avenues, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua which will ask for a discussion with that country," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," added President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City where they plan to attend the takeover of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, in the framework of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc will meet in advance to approve the Action Plan for 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of Unasur, although it is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who took part in the 6th Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, TV Péru, that Europeans "had killed themselves during the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but they were now almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by the Unasur member countries.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the President of Ecuador expressed his support for the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, but we, the South American, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not betray his principles, but instead respected his "profound democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish courts for demanding that he undergo an interrogation in his territory concerning an alleged sexual offence, while “Swedish legislation allows him to do so by videoconference, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London”.
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's mental and physical health will deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said the President of Ecuador.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"It affects everyone's health," he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be the award of a safe conduct to allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and points out that he had discussions in London to find a solution to the detention of WikiLeaks' founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of proceedings in various European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted safe driving as early as tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as its legislation quite allows, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate was "the mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression".
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not malevolent or perverse politicians, but bad journalists for greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed the fact that this is not the kind of journalists "not the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate in Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution in order to pursue the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised attempts at coup d'état", because in reality "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the President of Ecuador considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We must resolve them as a whole in order to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the successful resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that it was "benefiting that Latin America would seize international forums if both countries agreed to accept a judgment as firm as it was".
Referring to the possibility of his being nominated as a candidate for the future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the primarys of February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador's, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this eventual victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I will withdraw from political life.
If we lose, I will.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for better regional integration in order to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when he was confirmed with the HIV test.
"It was as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to find out about him and his hard work was such that he had just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was speechless."
In those days, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same", said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes as reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
HIV/AIDS infectiologist and expert, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a life-threatening disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of affective immune system of patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years for CD4 levels of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reach 500 CD4 levels.
To put it simply, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at age 25, "as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years", explained the scientist interviewed.
In order to put this progress in context, it is important to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years on average.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died as a result of AIDS has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients identified on the national data basis have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
Then why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the past 12 years at least, we've never missed drugs, the problem is that patients come to very advanced stages because they don't know they're infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to carry out earlier diagnoses and, for that, to offer massive screening tests, to all those who ask for it".
The experts and members of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida) agree with his proposal, as do the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and, despite his young age, he was already carrying AIDS and suffering from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better if I have three times a week," they say, "I don't.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To date, his parents only know that he is suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and to the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of World AIDS Day.
Let them do the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and the better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they must know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message sums up the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programmes and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "the distribution of condoms has actually been increased, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, it is very good, but it results, that still today, some do not have access to condoms", he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, says the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold at counters, but be found in public toilet dispensers and in places where young people attend.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor was it a question of paying the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had said when asked whether there would be a distribution of condoms in his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, the best is to provide condoms to people already sexually active," he stressed.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 of AIDS and 1.317 of HIV).
The State is the fourth largest state in the country in terms of the number of new and cumulative cases of AIDS and the 13th largest in terms of the number of HIV patients.
92% of the contamination occurs by sex, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who do not know.
A judgment ratified on appeal by a United States court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt through commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario sets a bad precedent for all domestic companies with ramifications in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
It therefore seems that the procedures for the survival of societies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with a starry banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgement handed down on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the North District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenceless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's main glass manufacturer to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the trial judge states that creditors must register under the United States Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Appeal Court, based in New Orleans, states that the main proceeding is formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in insolvency cases of companies with a transnational profile.
Indeed, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been created for that purpose by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by Vitro's subsidiaries towards the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
Here there are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since there remained the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case Vitro's creditors who fought against this in the courts of the United States, that is to say the "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A data omitted by the appellate court.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has faced since 2008 without stopping at the serious economic crisis facing the United States, passing on costs to the country.
For the time being, the González Sada family society will appeal to the same appeal court to have the vote taken in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance remedy will demand non-prosperity and requires a review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("court friend") in which Vitro's procedure under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act was detailed, pointing out that it freed him from the agreements signed by the two countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he pointed out that the country had adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which guaranteed fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they sit on Vitro and they sit on the country.
General review
The complaints of the Mexican Aviation Company's trade unions against the company's former boss, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were ignored for several months, the latter was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviateurs has already encountered problems.
The case, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just submitted a criminal application against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw F/589 trust from the bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're besieging the Dragon Mart.
Meeting at the weekend in an amphitheatre of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and civil society members approved the creation of a broad opposition front at the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the South-East zone in order to oppose the monumental project which is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead.
The government has put forward a requirement of the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under his English acronym of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already in ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was well done that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "Basball is my whole life"
The globetrotter of the basketball "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, traveled all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as great as that of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage condemned him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether it be as a player of the lower leagues, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or as president of the basketball federation.
"I have worn several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his unusual itinerary, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
From all his memories, the ones he loved most were those who reminded him of his career as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
"It was my best years, the ones I took the most advantage of because I had the chance to compete in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
It's been a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead in the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a strong player for you, he's two meters tall.
Do you want it?"
That's how to start Mincy, one of Puerto Rico's best players.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win one championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He was delighted with the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only remotely since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his duties and those of Mincy on the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if that Canadian judge hadn't had us play the last game again," said Reyes.
Is the 1990 World Team the best national team you've ever seen?
She was one of the best, as was the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is that of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won the gold and we beat the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the suspended players with the improglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all the predictions.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Undoubtedly, it is Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level as Piculín did.
And that does not take into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like Leo Arill's work.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Having been one of the most glorious times on the national team between 1988 and 1995 and the fact that by the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have wanted to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys play only in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island during national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when it is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch videos of my time on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide by the leading role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied an unscrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of complications of a cancer, according to a statement from the family sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in her dear hometown of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved the most," said the family.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who interpreted his wife's role in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he was living his life completely," Gray said in a statement.
The doctors had diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he had admitted to having drunk a lot for many years.
In 1995, he had been detected with a malignant liver tumor and had undergone a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television as an ordinary type in the series "Jinny of my dreams" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also played in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in the cinema are well received roles by the critics in "Le groupe", "Harry et Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman enjoyed his greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and their loved ones was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated speculation all over the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the response was revealed in an episode in November 1980, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had made her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave town, but others also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to intern his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R," said Hagman in 1988.
We should write, "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he's lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as a man " immense, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already finished for the second season and a sixth is in progress, informed the channel.
For the time being, neither the Warner nor the TNT channel have communicated on how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who knew fame with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she was born in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps in New York theatres in the early 1950s and served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': J.R.'s merciless memoirs)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect him in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I trust them again, I come with them when they come for surgery and after," he says in 1996.
I'm trying to give them some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a while, but it's gonna be okay."
He has also been an anti-tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion teacher Stuart Charmé decided to give a lecture on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing there an irresistible hook: the end of the "big count" of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, to which many people refer as proof of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what he was waiting for in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax abyss that some dubbed the "Armageddon of Debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end times thought that the apocalypse would trigger.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," said Professor Charmé this week to his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey.
If we look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, it was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is evil is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to teach about "the end of the world" this semester, which, in theory, will be the last in history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply entitled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world does not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In Pennsylvania, the final exam will be spent the day before the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses have proved quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-level students, made up of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked if there was room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, University of Rutgers-Camden.
For the fear of Revelation, whether secular or religious, is only a question of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Infirmary, claims to have watched all apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone one professor, told us that they believed in the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it," says Julie zegle, a 21-year-old student in Temple from West Chester.
The Mayas have never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I concede that there is an anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to a rise in these speculations.
"In other places around the globe, people don't think about it," he says.
This is the majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that we were teaching here about "the end of the world".
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years, we've talked about the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or to philosopher on the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many told us they thought they were going to "end of the world" parties.
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh at each other," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
