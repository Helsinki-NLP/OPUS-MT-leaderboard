Barack Obama to be the fourth U.S. president to receive Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours and be the fourth U.S. President in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be presented to him, among other things, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy program.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the very first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then includes an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will be crowned in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, but only the third who will be awarded the award in the Committee's own forum.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he receives this award as a president who is currently waging a war in two countries.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to emphasize.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of 10 million Swedish krona (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate it to charities, but he has not yet concretely decided which ones.
His busy program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at that price at first.
He mentioned, for example, that he felt that he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that this is not a price for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as the announcement was made, he said it would be an "invitation to act".
A nature defender charged with blackmail
The police in Litomáice charged the president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litomáice with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction works procedures and asked for money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesman for the police of Litomáice.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litomáice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and faces up to three years' imprisonment.
Waste sorting bins are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packages, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on sorting bins at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you'd have to take several minutes to find the proper dumpsters.
I don't mean we wouldn't sort the garbage at all in Brno.
But I have the impression that the city councillors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of the number of dumps dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city center?
It's a whole science, which mainly requires time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found right now is Moravia Square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't blame me, but it doesn't seem so damn good.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it's not a sinecure either.
So, finally, many of my friends don't sort their garbage.
By laziness.
Makes them a trot to get to the dumpsters.
I'm not surprised at them.
I myself, after a party, offered to throw away a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any coloured dumpsters on Kunicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place to go on the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing with it.
It's after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city best, right?!
It is probably that ecology and so-called aesthetics do not interest the Socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city a spot in the first hockey league that is embarrassing the city all over the country, instead of buying some extra dumpsters and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad to have been able to reinforce my impression with official statistics after having dragged a moment on the internet.
According to EKO-KOM data, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravia region.
Paroubek's budget has taken away pension money and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's advice, farmers or civil servants may lack money for pensions, sick leave or savings on housing.
But also for interest on the debt of the State or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make loans for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting the problems back to later, undermining the ground," Janota said.
It should be noted that interest on borrowed money is increasing and will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state has no real choice as to where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social assistance or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those who the left has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and must not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater debt of the state - next year it will not miss 163 billion in the caisses, but more.
In spite of Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will grow faster and faster, and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The state will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
Another five billion will be needed to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly parts already decided and started, and it is not possible to modify the projects in order to reduce costs.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major projects, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very adroitly - it will draw from the dividends of the ČEZ (supplyer and distributor of electric energy), which the state mainly owns and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of the dividends is never certain and in no case is it a well without substance.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of environmental damage, to supplement pension accounts or to serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 per cent of GNP according to EU rules.
And this is far from the end of the carnival of transfers.
The budget for various compensations to the victims of communism and crimes, or even savings on housing, has fallen by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the side of the department or, at worst, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a shortfall of $100 million in the $2 billion Crown Fund project, which is designed to track on-line the expenditures of each administration.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just one button and you move from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the objective of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware company in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and it was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is by no means fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to devices during 2012.
Snow shortages in the mountains bother hoteliers
Desert runways are not a problem only for ski lift operators.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users go through the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they ask right away if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operating the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend the New Year's Eve of your dreams in Špindlerěv Mlýn, you better not hesitate too much to book.
If we give priority to savings and the quality of the accommodation comes only afterwards, then we can try to wait a few more days.
Hoteliers in Špindler only offer a week's stay for New Year's Eve.
I think they're going to try to put them in for a while, but they're going to give up too, and they're going to accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura estimated.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
Christmas week is of most interest to us at the moment, it is not sold completely.
There's still half the rooms in our offer, let's say.
That's why we've already prepared some cheaper last minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourist agency can also offer the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February leave just as well, the remaining winter stays sell moderately.
This year, interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the snowless mountain.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will also be complete," says Schiefert.
On the other hand, the occupation of the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sn+kou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We've got a few last places left for New Year's Eve as well as Christmas.
There is a great interest during the Polish holiday of January and February is also selling well," informs Karel Rada, manager of the best hotel in Pec.
Hotel Omnia near the central car park of Jánské Lázně is also 80 percent complete during the New Year's period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupation at the present time.
February is a little weaker for now but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše will certainly grow again indicated the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
However, Krkonoše hoteliers should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be cooler and if there is precipitation, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But later, the weather is expected to warm up, informs Ji­Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: Repetition Is Mother of Wisdom · Global Voices
It even becomes comical, the tireless effort with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of wise, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan issue, which he himself considered to be quite simple.
When he ended up letting his doctrine sweat so eagerly awaited, it turned out that he had copied it to carbon paper since Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending further reinforcements to an Iraq consumed by the civil war as being "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which came from the recommendations of the campaign commanders, was the only one possible and likely to succeed so much that the newspapers at present do not speak at all about Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, however, objectively speaking, he left his successor with a much more favourable final situation than one could expect.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan the miracle will happen again
It was again the campaign commanders who asked him for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House's reticence despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months but, in the absence of a better option, he at least swindled the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to extirpate the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though he originally had 10 000.
What brings the most problems to Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and complete this whole process within three years. Obama's whole doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that a half increase will bring the same benefits as the increase in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out by the exact opposite - no one can be relied on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, who are accustomed to changing their leadership on a day-to-day basis, depending on what suits them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain nothing but powder in the eyes behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is singularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity in the relationship, which is further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "early-to-act state", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The temporal horizon of Obama's strategy is perplexed by his voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of war with a view to their "prompt return home" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will regard it as the indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the strengthened sanctions do not affect Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of resolving the problem through the use of military force.
This will have to be answered, for example, at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
Obama's only rustin is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for him to plan on a new strategy, in case it proves to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executive employees of Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced this to respond to strong criticisms of its wage practices.
The group of 30 chief executives will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell for five years.
Actions may be withdrawn from management in the event that they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus the leader of the effort to link compensation with long-term performance at Wall Street.
I guess Wall Street is well aware of the global sense that needs to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after setting aside almost $17 billion for bonuses over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters agency.
With the onset of the financial crisis, high premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to allocate a one-time tax of fifty percent the bonuses of bankers in excess of 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics
It is five women, a record number, who today received in Stockholm from the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prizes in technical and literature disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists there was also German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine with their fellow countryman Jack Szostak for their chromosome research.
The Chemistry Award was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn't have a winner this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the pecuniary award.
It reaches 10 million Swedish kroons in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the award among themselves.
The highly awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
He, in his speech, recognized the controversial nature of his reward since he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the expense of his policy, he added that in some situations war is essential to achieving peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning finance minister Eduard Janota, who weighs his stay in the government due to his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that Janota's budget and possibly Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda for their Friday appointment.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further deepens the crisis in public finances.
President Radim Ochvat informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be subject to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion kroons that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, on Wednesday the Chamber of Deputies approved the Left's proposals on money transfers and increased the remuneration of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the Social Democrats' proposals on the fact that they would increase the budget deficit indirectly.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, which challenges the future of Fischer's cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the SDO, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by the MEPs, removes the package of savings measures passed by the Fischer government, which, in his view, must stem the debt of the state.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but is not obliged to do so, said today during a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "unreliable deficit" of public finances.
Now there is, in his view, no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if it could build on a consensus of wider political parties, according to the president.
The president of the ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is frightening and that the government should question its future existence.
The vice-president of the ODS Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "radical verdicts".
The leader of the ČSSD Ji­ Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is staggering and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday already, the ČSSD has declared the ratification of the state budget to be successful for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman to play Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood movie
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood Invictus - Invincu film will expose to the world many things about the country, its fights and its victories.
History talks about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an Oscar-winning American actor, plays the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was an ninety-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him, "If I have to play you, I should be able to see you personally..
The seventy-two-year-old actor who was awarded a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's Milion Dollar Baby drama in the middle of boxing, for example, incarnate the leader of a movement against slavery that became himself a slave, a fictional US president, or even God in the movie Evan Almighty but never someone still alive and as important for so many people as Mandela is.
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work in support of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and it is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. Newly elected President Mandela knows that his country still remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually advance to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela's story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role in such a way as to bring it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I get back from your energy, it is transmitted and I felt like I know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I rang at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, "I look much bigger in the movie."
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the leadership of director Eastwood received positive opinions and we even talk about ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews at rottentomates.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive ratings.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the Bulava-type missile, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly away, or she damaged herself in full flight.
Russian newspapers talk about "Bulava" as the "missile that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test was normally conducted at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was damage to the aircraft again.
It was obviously the engine on the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew off the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can just be set on fire from a moving and submerged boat
This is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably caused by a defective Bulava.
Besides, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket resisted and the damage touched only the third.
In previous cases, the engines have experienced failures on the first stage.
Although none of the test launches occurred without a hit, the Department of Defence management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and they therefore always claim that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will carry even ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at age 51
Legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will be back in a professional game at age 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will assist his Moscow CSKA team in need and will probably make his entry already in Friday's game against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at age 40 in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details about the form, says club coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It was not specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player would concern only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and got 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
In the colours of the Soviet Union he won gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven world champion titles, and triumphed at the Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also received tributes in the NHL, where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai listened to the unions and canceled all overtime
The management of the Hyundai factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by spokesperson Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai plant.
However, management still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday that is still working this year.
We can't give up our production plan, it's essential, that's why volunteer overtime was offered on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The Sedmička.cz website indicated that the company offered a Czech 400 kroon bonus to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be awarded posteriori for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, has decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can place a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their holiday year-end indicated Vaněk.
In addition to this all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and demands of unions as well as employees who spontaneously ceased production last week, management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, employees at the car factory were forced to work almost two hours of overtime in addition to their eight hours on a daily basis.
The unions intend to cancel the strike after the agreement has been signed.
The next negotiation between the management of the car factory and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the strike if they agreed on their demands and signed a common document.
The situation in the factory peaked last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of unceasing overtime.
They also protested against the poor conditions of wages and so-called hazing.
The management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work additionally to meet the requirements in terms of automobile production.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the trade unions also asked that workers who have ceased production be not subject to any sanctions.
The unions ask the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a reward of 5,000 kroons (approximately €209) for them.
The Hyundai car factory in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started production in series last year in November.
It manufactured about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, having a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "hardening" HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also affects viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality, in some cases, takes precedence over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on common variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
However, the lives of patients can be radically extended through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their use leads to a series of side effects.
Moreover, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of developing so-called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of the experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are an assemblage of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bindings on virus proteins.
The metalocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by boron, hydrogen, and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease, mature infectious particles of the virus would not be born.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases was tested in test pieces as well as on its resistant variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical drugs, but it does not weaken on resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations that need to be explored further to move towards the development of effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína Öez­ová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The ODS is attacking Fischer, who defends himself
President Mirek Topolánek of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party) described the budget ratified for the following year as "effrant" and, according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister described the words of the ODS as a drastic verdict.
He says he's taking time to analyze.
SDO spokesman Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, the SDO and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether he is supporting the minority in the Chamber of Deputies who is concerned about fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about remaining in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the SDO and the Social Democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
On Wednesday, the Chamber of Deputies ratified the budget for 2010, with proposals for amendments amounting to 12 billion kroons included by the left.
The House increased money for civil servants' salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's complaint to the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of SEK 163 billion.
The SDO left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that a modified budget is a less bad alternative than a temporary budget.
Deception and inutility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of inutility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave his post in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment Monday with the Prime Minister after his visit to the government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering whether he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the negotiations on the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who have imposed the changes in the budget, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws that increase the deficit, such as those that affect health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the SDO are not at issue.
This is the case of the Leader of the Fischer Government and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the SDO did nothing harmful, said Topolánek in a text release from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some departments claimed TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the level of the public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
Having said that, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I haven't thought about it and once it's on the agenda, then I'll focus on it, said since the Chamber to journalists, Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected to the government precisely by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew away in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The SDO reversed at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the SDO would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday had it not expressly asked the Democrats to allow the budget to be voted on.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not small children, did he react to the question of whether the SDO had not been criticized by the president of the Party in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew at the time I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a Bolshevisation of the House and a destruction of everything positive, reacted Topolánek himself.
According to the new timetables of the ČD there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit from 13 December certain less loaded express or regional trains and will instead strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will decrease on the day of entry into force of the new timetables by two percent compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic and reduced rates.
For example, it is the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a ram pendolino.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the Prague - Letohrad direct line will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the Hradec Králové region by a total of eight percent, but Prague and its surroundings can be pleased with an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the circulation of some express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the greatest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change at Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main railway station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nádra­).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart in two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
This year's bill for the regional railways: an additional Kr 200 million.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Railways next year in total four billion kroons to settle visible losses, which is the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for their total eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate in almost three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
Railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they did not use a price increase for the vast majority of transport tickets.
The changes will affect only ČD Net day tickets and eLiška discounted internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroons.
The price of eLiška will newly depend on the journey travelled, while so far it was valid between cities of a region of choice and was at a single price of 160 kroons.
Filipino rebels are still holding more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels have abducted 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed it, but that spoke to the origin of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields during a flight from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to reach an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the military wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police initially prosecuted the kidnappers following violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in Maguindanao province in the south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the elections of the governor's administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of that province of the South Philippines was arrested following suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
South Africa's history concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in American theaters in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was awarded to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theatres, feedback from critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
By his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Mind, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes since it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full preparation for the football World Cup, and because the media are agitated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants by the ruling black majority.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are for the time being rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations expressed about the main roles where Hollywood stars "pavante".
Morgan Freeman is, however, proud of the film by taking up his own terms.
I dreamt of this role for many years and I prepared myself well.
I have also met with Nelson Mandela many times personally in order to be able - as they say - to recover from his energy, he said during the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember Mandela's personality and message through the film.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns each individual.
Wear the national rugby team jersey
The film based on the story of the novel by the British writer John Carlin is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave his creation to the people portrays the South African human rights defender during his term as president.
Morgan Freeman tries during the film to put together two racial groups of a long divided population and as Nelson Mandela entered the South African team's national jersey on the World Cup lawn, which South Africa had won at the time.
For showing up on the jersey lawn, which is considered sacred in South Africa, Mandela had been long ovationd fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by the white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in uniting people again into a single nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
South African whites, however, are sceptical, as recently told in an interview with LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of wreaths in flames in the Louny region
A fire swallowed up in the morning a transformer of the company Čeps of the distribution center near the commune of V
According to Ústí firefighters spokesman, Luk­Marvan, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer consume, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to Pavla Mandátova's spokesman, the incident does not endanger the safe functioning of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
She added that in ten years of activity Čeps had not experienced anything similar and that incidents of this type were isolated.
Electricity supplies have not been interrupted, says ČEZ's spokesman for the Northern Bohemian So+a Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator on Czech territory of transmission sets and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, refurbishes and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transmission systems to distribution systems and lines of 4339 kilometres in length.
Jančura will bring charges for defamation against three prefects of the ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, is now filing a defamation complaint against three Social Democratic Prefects.
And concretely against Michal Hašek of the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesa
Jančura indicated it in Dvacet minut of Radiožurnál.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions concluded long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of us attacked us and claim that we're doing the fine mouths, while we've only made an offer for what they want themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
It's in exchange for slanders about Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
He also indicated that he had evidence that no region had proceeded in accordance with European law.
This is why we are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr Jančura's complaint represents the continuation of his media show which serves as a free publicity for his company and for his person.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek.
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable steps taken by the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he will interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he intends to resume it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign would be aimed at corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura started its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of approximately SEK 150 billion, without issuing a tender.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought to Jančura threats from a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licences.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is, but I won't say his name," Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcals will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voices are already rising, saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for August children.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal diseases.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination started last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the 3rd and 5th months of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
Yet the parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for a dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Specialists estimate that each year sickness insurance spends 300 to 450,000 kroons in vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
So far, the State has spent approximately 500,000 crowns per year on all immunization of children.
The vaccination reimbursed was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcals cause inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age due to pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible obligation to immunise in the future.
From January, it must be paid by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský said that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose this at least.
I think this is a direction that must now be followed, Kalovský said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We do not envisage it at all for the time being, said its spokesman Vlastimil Srše
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Paediatric Society, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, one could consider a decrease in vaccination renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional", says Cabrnochová.
Specialists expect that as of next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Vaccination against pneumococcals is also a break because it is the first vaccination of children that is financed by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should free up funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
This, however, is linked to the concerns of paediatricians in practice, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by the insurance companies, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products supplied by the state.
However, some Members were concerned that this would allow insurance to "deduct the sums from health insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to reimburse them.
It is estimated that paediatricians will have to individually invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Flight"
Frank Frazetta's son, a well-known illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth GBP 20 million (12 million) from his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police stated that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and a trailer.
According to her, Mr.Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the museum into the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr.Frazetta Senior, aged 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press (AP) news agency.
AP cited a police official who said that the young Mr.Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, said 52-year-old Mr.Frazetta Jr. claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denied that he had given such an authorization, said the agency.
Labour defends the increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the tax increase and expenditure reductions announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor has also attracted lightning by attacking low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, we can see an increase of 0.5% in Social Insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public wages from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
The trade unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession for which they are not responsible and warned that "problems" were coming up.
The reduction in social insurance - which will get around GBP 3 billion a year - has made the business world angry, because he believes it is a tax on jobs while the goal should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than GBP 20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PRINCIPAL ISSUES OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social insurance will increase further by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
The increase in corporate income tax for small corporations has been abandoned.
Tax rebates for electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, one person earning GBP 30,000 will lose GBP 90 per year and one person earning GBP 40,000 will lose GBP 190, while one person earning GBP 10,000 per year will gain GBP 110 more.
Ministers said that their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 led to "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would weigh on the first 5 % of employees.
Stephen Timms, Secretary of the Treasury, refuted an increase in the tax and pointed out that a decrease in spending was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, and they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely indispensable over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident and that economic growth would restart at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts of economic growth - which will influence the amount it will have to borrow and the speed with which the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor had to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the decline of 3.5% predicted in April - while the borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Missed opportunity"
The Conservatives who will launch a new publicity campaign this Thursday warning against the "debt crisis" of Labour, said that the plan to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to pay back, they added, eluding "cynically" difficult choices until after the elections - to be held in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary of the Treasury of the Ghost Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
"The important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, contrary to Tory's proposals that would lead to a faster and larger reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised through tax increases and lower spending would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "wind-built".
Nick Robinson, Political Editor of the BBC, said that the schedule of announcements - such as the increase in inflation for some disability benefits next April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor facing propaganda accusations, the money being simply recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is being provided as people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Fake Budget"
While ministers did not publish details of spending beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that restrictions on public spending would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Etudes Fiscales) said that the Chancellor's figures in the future imply substantial reductions in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only postponed," said its Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report, and the markets are well aware of it."
FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American reporters suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in eastern Punjab province, announced the US Embassy in Pakistan, at the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether they were the same men who were reported missing from their homes in Virginia State last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are detained," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, FBI spokesman, stated that the agency was aware of the arrests and that she was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing," she said.
The Embassy of Pakistan in Washington claimed that the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
She said that the house was already being monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been laid against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, reported the news agency Reuters, but she said that the United States must "cooperate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students had been reported missing from their homes by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuse"
Human rights have been as poorly respected as ever in the last 20 years, according to Amnesty International's report.
The report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the presidential election campaign in June.
One man named in the report stated that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another stated that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its failure to respect human rights.
The authorities have stated that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the detention centre in Kahrizak.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"Fause confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook networks' and protesting against the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, in front of my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still in blood and half conscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the losing candidate in the elections, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said that he had been locked in a container with 75 other persons, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary should establish a committee to investigate post-election disturbances and the government's response, but said that the mandate and powers of these bodies were not clear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested over the past three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn the Bristol site into a competition track.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders competing for cash prizes.
At the top of Brandon Hill Park Trail, a small springboard preceded a 100m long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the view from the top of the track was beautiful but that it was quite intimidating.
It is a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city shining below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowborders in the country - real talent," he added.
Prizes were awarded for the best flying - or figures made on the runway.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be abandoned to cast iron.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted to this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French do not like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious picture.
A good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country now.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for 5m-6m Muslims.
He is very good at listening to and reproducing the debates between teachers and pupils on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to obtain a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that are of concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't push the debate to the end.
The conservators do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their fellow lawyers of a Sunni purist Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who nowadays make up a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wonders how much the French politicians (and the intellectual elite so virulent in secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a "closeness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the far north, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and policies of whaling, he described the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were proving themselves by hunting the polar bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson, then a courageous 14-year-old aspirant who had only to fight the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, captured while swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous spectacle brought together 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the size of a zoo is usually one millionth of the surface required for a free adult.The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green because of the algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often goes back to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two nations of hunting that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating glimpse of what the future might be like there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither amospherists nor oceanographers can accurately relate the speed of change.
It's not because of trying.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering voyages gave the first information on the melting of the ice cap.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the sub-surface relief changes.
Satellite surveillance and probes on icebergs are of great help, but the bulk of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice-dependent system, formed by brackish water fillets pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it'll be our turn"
Marines, of the 6,000 people who laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington
The first class De'Angello Robinson, 19, made a seven-hour bus trip to lay a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who travelled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who one day were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on veterans' graves in various sections of Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery Ceremony.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen travel every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honour of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the Memorial for Victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, stated that she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who sacrificed themselves.
This is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Embedded in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the lawns and the extensive hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as from the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited as the new graves, said the organizers.
The mood was optimistic, as the children played and the couples stood by the hand, carrying the crowns of fresh pine on the grey graves.
Each round crown had a dark green colour, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Close by, silenced Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan were buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals were crying without hiding, others were praying, and families and friends were supporting themselves in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others leaned to see the small black and white information maps, buried in the wet ground for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many weeping mothers on her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and had driven eight hours to come and collect on the grave of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget how free we are... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I've disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American national arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American national who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, said the services of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific accusations have not been made public, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, lead to the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how husbands are and is being followed and harassed by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but authorizations have always been denied.
The detention of an American national may increase tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a "soft" approach in order to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new American policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country where an official's average salary is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for text messages or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a pay day.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to sign in must communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few American prisoners in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press secretary to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that in any other open society would be allowed -- free distribution of mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country to replace Fidel, his sick older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when both countries were beginning to engage in a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization supposed to be plotting a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they hoped that this case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who are foaming the Internet in search of radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed that they hunted a hidden insulting personality, known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video website on the Internet.
When they arrived in Pakistan, they were guided by Saifullah, who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani secret service representative who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north-east becoming a refuge for terrorism.
They were considered undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition that they remain anonymous because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to gain entry into al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential and perhaps more important terrorists in the determination of those who trust them.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the priority of the United States intelligence services has been to infiltrate men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of barrier guards, refusing entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propagandous value.
However Evan Kohlmann, expert of the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups must also pay more and more attention, in recent years in the choice of people they accept because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model than so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen call for "action" for climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked in the streets here on Saturday, demanding more action on the climate from negotiators working in the city's Bella Convention Center convention hall.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but estimated at 25,000 by the police.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On this day when little happened during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city, deploying signs in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish saying 'The Earth says it has enough'.
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travelling to her mother's home country, Peru, has opened her eyes to the heartbreaking problems facing the country because of the impact of climate change that is already happening."
That's one of the reasons why I decided to join the big march -- to get the word out and to appeal to leaders around the world to make decisions that are fair, ambitious and committed, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella centre and said that they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing masks or were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella centre and said that they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing masks or were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in the climate discussions, activists who wore black masks and clothes, lit several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the demonstrators have failed to awaken the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's climate representative.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "In fact, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then went on to Mandarin, declaring "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful depending on the outlook.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others."
Test results reveal persistent differences between races
Last week's federal report on mathematical results brought good news for Washington D.C.'s public schools.
Although the District is still far behind the leading institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) have made much greater progress over the past two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between the performance of African-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white children in Grade 4 (cm1) in Washington, D.C., have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but those of their African-American classmates have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling only from one point, from 245 to 244.
The average result of the blanks was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overall view over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1) class, when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262-22).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by group director of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean that we raised the aggregate by looking at the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates for equality in District education.
I don't jump for one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (apparent Democrat), member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said the message from the test results is that the city's middle schools (college) desperately need attention.
Really, you still want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what scares us is that we do not devote enough time and energy to our middle schools (college).
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at school children in the late elementary and early secondary school classes who did not integrate the basics of reading earlier in their school life and who are quite late compared to their peers.
Every day, the mathematics program, for Kindergarten (motherhood) classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they were set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply think we need to continue working to offer better interventions to these students at a lower level than the class," said Rhee.
Others felt that NAEP's results raised the question of whether Rhee could continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with lower results in order to narrow the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education trainer at the University of Berkeley, California, who is studying the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also, this targeting may have political implications that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like other school superintendents, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We are focused on developing a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, wherever they come from, are assured that their children will be able to obtain an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendant of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the essential elements to narrow the gap was the length of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of his teachers last year to get 185 days, that he considers a "start point" to get another increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise of the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descends and blinks a moment from the eyes in view of the white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents were only able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students in the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of a newly impressed student than enthusiastic.
That's where I'm going to study! Graciela exclaimed who would like to study medicine, as the guide directed them to the entrance to the science building.
"Youpi, really?" she said, thinking, when she was told the low ratio of law professor to student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you are going to university:
The question is where.
Although this question remains largely for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents in adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one in five Hispanics of the "second generation" pursues high school education -- a notable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, researchers say, they pave the way for future generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study the batons claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many parents also set high goals for their children and found ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, won't help them," said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepare yourself), it provides over $300 million per year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been attended by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent entering university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry secures agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract significant oil companies to rebuild its troubled infrastructure during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry, which has been invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
The American companies have left with a stake in only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who put on an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies obtained contracts for the auctioned fields in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way," said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an information website on the Internet.
It will take a long time for another offer to be made in Iraq.
Concerns about security, supported by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as US military troops retreated, hampered US oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with greater force, which has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, analysts say.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The largest United States companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided technical advice, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
China National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has bid more on contracts than other companies and has left with significant stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The pre-selected auction companies made offers that were then compared to the per barrel rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the main al-Qaida organizers was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that an American missile, which struck along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, declared on Friday the US counter-intelligence authorities.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles thrown into their cars on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that the missiles had been fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA within Pakistan's anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of the Pakistani Civil Secret Service, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
Representatives of the authority said that suspected local activists rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what remained of the "completely shredded bodies".
It was totally impossible for the local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two US anti-terrorist representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as one of the military organizers of al-Qaida who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy to attack the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic directions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the United States stated that Somali had made rapid progress in the ranks of al-Qaida's and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the general public in the United States, but that does not diminish the threat he poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major al-Qaida figure or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a militant faction in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has declined since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to the figures put forward by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, says the site.
United Nations Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
The UN Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate with allegations of widespread corruption during the UN-supported presidential elections.
Eide's departure came at a time when the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States' timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community," said Eide in a telephone interview with Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he was not resigning but would simply honour his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives stated that the name Staffan di Mistura had been mentioned; he was a citizen of Italo-Switzerland who had recently presided over a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who had previously led United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September of promoting President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and of concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but stated that Galbraith's accusations -- which was thanked -- "were detrimental to the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism about international election observation."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of United States forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN leaders to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration about the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy United Nations hiring regulations were hindering his ability to bring new talent.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran needs additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the world's major powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a parterre of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week's visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, defiled the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a conclusion. ̈
One of the things that weighs me the most is that if I've learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it's the unpredictable side of the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He said that a "set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be less secure with nuclear weapons" because "his people would suffer enormously" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme back in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experience solely for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon a significant portion of his stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for the desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a way to build confidence on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have moved away from attempts at agreement - in part, say the experts, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, Iran's stiffening in the face of some of the international community's proposals for which they had in fact agreed in early October, prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in what they had not envisaged, in terms of significant additional sanctions against Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set 31 December as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement made on Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "unsubstantiated allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and affirmed its agreement to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the rich oil region of Kurdish to meet the troop leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly regarding borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in US plans to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the Kurds' anxiety about the pending withdrawal. The US authorities quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you."
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters preaching them, "Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An extra baby is an extra grave".
They have learned so well the lesson that the authorities of the Shanghai Government, alarmed by the low birth rate of their city and by the ageing of the population, have radically changed their course this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction has been instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We don't have a second left," said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources, who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, nicknamed "little emperors", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from six to 1.8 children per couple when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050, well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the resident population registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, stated that fertile couples must have babies in order "to help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a lack of labour in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive mitigation
Written in the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of the single child is, without a doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and face discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have given the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the execution of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority forced pregnant women of a second child to have an abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys to girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Beijing University, said central government authorities recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive birth promotion campaign.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city's government has sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and slip leaflets under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the family planning officer, the response was disappointing.
Dissatisfaction
Although officials in a rural city in the suburbs of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in applications from couples wishing to have a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there is no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly more than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the family planning committee in the municipality of Caolu of Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly consider the policy of the single child to be a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the first child of the couple.
It's true, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she wanted only one child because she was one herself. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone take care of us."
We don't have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company says it more seriously.
For couples working two, middle class, who lower the birth rate, he says, one must be selfish if it is to succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 grew up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and do not want to have this lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even one child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his resume to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations group has draft emission reduction plans
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- has returned to the spotlight on Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations supporting most of the burden, in the coming times.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as it informed the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that are running out of time, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Drafted by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not say how rich countries would give to the poor to withstand global warming, both in the short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Sierra Club's representative in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN Executive Secretary General described on climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the complete picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent of 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, over the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched the negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
On Friday, however, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, US Climate Negotiator, rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared to the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if not financed by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the main developing countries, says Stern, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister, He Yafei, said that the US main negotiator, either lacked "good sense", or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the US would not help China financially to combat global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives of acting more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were struggling to find out who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which is developed a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries that are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say that the negotiations will lead at least to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a 24-page treaty, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the Climate Unit of the European Commission, said that the action of small island states "has put political pressure on the complete political process", partly because they are now unified and they are asking emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The discussions became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on the need to resolve most of the outstanding issues before Heads of Government reached agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Minister of the Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister descended from their aircraft and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend in-house meetings and information conferences, so that they could make claims that will be considered in the following week.
The real image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Congress Centre every day -- guitar player activists present nocturnal shows mocking the countries that they believe are betraying and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the courtyard of the greats, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice-president for global policy of Conservation International.
The heavy goods vehicles are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday's syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. Monday morning, a whistle will break through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed commuter train will reach 225 km/h, while travelling from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first commuter train Javelin outside London.
He hoped that the new service would allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and would link the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The small lost holes will become thriving suburban cities, business travel will be much shorter and the passage of the aircraft and car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and the fears of environmental dangers risk curbing British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will deliver its document to Lord Adonis on December 30th.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new London-West Midlands line will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where environmental impact can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up up to 25 meters from the final itinerary.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a larger, northward high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch going west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another going north-east, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option" said a rail professional.
When this is over, travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400 km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m long and capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts state that only St Pancras International or Euston offers this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it starts the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
First of all, trains will be forced to run off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, maintaining journey times between London and Scotland in excess of three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a passage from aircraft to trains, which is a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay GBP 75,000 loan for Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, the main member of Parliament Tory, had the taxpayer pay thousands of pounds a year to pay back the cost of an orangery he built in his home in his riding.
The leader of the party who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that the members of parliament were "stored", increased his loan by GBP 75,000 to build an oak extension to his second house in Rutland.
He had been authorized to charge the taxpayer for the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducted a control of members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan stated that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The surrounding houses were sold for almost £1 million.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the emoluments office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe her as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee regarding his pre-borrowing arrangements.
The Committee cleared him last month of any charges of non-compliance, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of borrowing GBP 271.406 from his London property at his constituency house, which he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan claimed about GBP 1,400 per month of interest on loans until March of last year.
In April, its requests increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the GBP 75,000 loan.
The RBS variable standard interest rate rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Duncan lost his position as head of the ghost cabinet in September, after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed him saying that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the expense scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated as "de la m...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and I asked for a small part, based on what was right.
and I could have asked for more, but I didn't."
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former post as an oil trader, began to explain his expenses in May, after it became apparent that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a £-shaped hole in Duncan's lawn to protest after it was revealed that he had applied for GBP 4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for major improvements, approved both by the fee office and then by Legg."
He added: "There's no problem with robbing or developing or using rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn't be clearer or simpler."
Faithful, come and see the calendar of Brighton Advent.
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each day of December, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1st, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., each day, with free blocks and hot wine.
Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the booth presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest from the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should get closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
"The idea of the Advent calendar of the beach cabin came right after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent it through spirituality."
Strong climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police carried out several hundred arrests.
According to the police, at least 30,000 people, some 100 thousand according to the organisers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the margins of the UN Climate Conference, which will reach an agreement by Friday that can enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilisation on climate around the world, illustrated by these events, helped to make "the political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the procession, when a group of 300 demonstrators, entirely dressed in black, broke windows with cobblestones and hammers, a journalist from the AFP observed.
Anti-riot police immediately intervened unabated.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these ultra-violent groups, who had notably illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", stressing that about 100 of them "were still held in the street on Saturday night "handled and kept in a sitting position despite the extreme cold".
From Parliament, the procession, rather good child, took over the direction of the Bella Center, site of the negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building, without seeking to enter it.
A scene had been created to welcome the speakers planned, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of demonstrators had come by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue waterproof, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue pools" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are going down the streets to demand reparation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying up in Africa, rivers where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, wearing bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, rallies of a few hundred demonstrators have also been held to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, the events organised by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
Abkhazia separatist elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 1700 GMT.
The turnout was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the outgoing president Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which resulted in thousands of deaths, Abkhazia seeks to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a nice white building with some palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential in this region with sumptuous landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed throughout this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the western part of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to Russian officials who came to monitor the elections.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations," replied Alexey Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as the one transferring control over the Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, said he did not support the current power or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be held within two weeks.
Climate: protests around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the alert, called nearly 700 people on the margins of a massive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, about 100 thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts until 18 December delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement that will enter into force on 1 January 2013.
As a party to Parliament, the procession, generally a good child, took over the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the centre, without seeking to penetrate it.
A scene had been created to welcome the speakers planned, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the procession left, a group of a few hundred demonstrators, entirely dressed in black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, a journalist from the AFP observed.
Anti-riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened indiscriminately, throwing several of them down.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups, which were notably illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a policeman was injured in the jaw by a cobblestone and four cars set on fire near a squat during incidents that led to the arrest of some 20 people, according to the police.
We look at the extremist groups, warned the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces turned in the sky.
The majority of the demonstrators, who came by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue waterproof, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue pools" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are going down the streets to demand reparation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, told the AFP that he had come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam has mobilized a number of personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who was to speak to the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas boasting solar energy in front of the Philippine capital city hall.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, rallies of a few hundred demonstrators have also been held to demand action against climate change.

The history-geo emerges strengthened from the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were "enhanced" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in scientific terminal.
From now on, first class students will all have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the minister, "we have to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "S is no longer a scientific sector" but "in general, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L channels cannot remain sub-wires of the S, he continues, stressing again: "I have also not heard many historians and intellectuals indignant at the absence of the history-geography at the terminal in the technological high schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) disagreed with the government's plan to eliminate the compulsory teaching of history-geography in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some elected from the right.
On the other hand, the minister added that there was no "no way" to remove the philosophy of the S terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which in their opinion sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will focus on their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, said the Minister.
They will also attend internships during the year of M2 and then be a first year in front of students as trainee teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more attendance in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister said that he would propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the plan to delete the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the stakes of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure de la rue d'Ulm, met on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a series of expert speeches, each of fifteen minutes, filmed and open to the public, noted a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the sidelines of the Edouard Hannezo conference, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day that takes its name from the one given by the students to the fish of the school basin.
Some 20 stakeholders were selected from among the experts in their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
On the subject of global warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes", said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes, but with the help of graphs, in front of about fifty people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the listeners will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
The videos from these conferences will be posted on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delays in payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
Unions of prison supervisors called Friday for "general mobility" to demand the payment by the end of the year of bonuses and overtime, whose payment was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd supervisory union) asked staff who will not be on duty to demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and to "block them", to "denouncing the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd trade union) calls them "to meet in general assemblies in the different prisons for a strong mobilization", considering "honest and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtime, night, Sunday and public holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Corrections and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime has increased significantly in 2009 and not all have been budgeted, but ensure that the remaining amounts will be paid in January.
The Chancery stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the supervisory unions guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by the staff to operate and modernize our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I have asked the management of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation, which is the result of a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours, does not happen again in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The pay of December will therefore be meagre, except for the management staff benefiting from the famous bonuses of functions and objectives, lamented the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budget constraints have good backs".
It is a pure scandal, has outraged the interregional union FO of Marseilles, announcing its decision to boycott until further order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and public holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, idem for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff's money, believes the CGT-penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less poorly distributed than others.
But anyway the account is not there, noted the general secretary of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he's offering "niceer things" than the ones he gets.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, told the "paves" of the little Oprah Winfrey screen that he had a simple gift rule: "I'm giving things nicer than the ones I get."
As part of a special show that will be broadcast on the ABC channel on Sunday evening, President and his wife Michelle provide an overview of how they intend to celebrate the end of the year celebrations in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be part of it.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would have "of course" a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcasted in advance.
And Michelle Obama went against her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he receives: "Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year," she teased the president.
Absolutely, did he have to concede before replying with humor by pointing out the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "Who gave you this?".
During this one-hour show, in a relaxed atmosphere, with the famous host who was a staunch supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the President and his wife also remembered their favourite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember that time when I met my dad came to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball, said the president.
It was only much later in my life that I realized that it was him who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operates, RTL says he's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-opted in Los Angeles because of important "lesions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors had found "leavings resulting from the operation" of the herniated disc suffered in Paris on November 26, said in Paris his press service, stating that these injuries had "need a restorative operation".
The singer's press service, however, sought to reassure itself that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was, however, plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens an eye, adds RTL.
When asked by the AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to certain sources" no drain would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for this herniated disc.
The surgery, scheduled for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux , a doctor well known in the artistic milieu.
This one was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL information.
Following his operation on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a relative of Johnny Hallyday, estimated Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but assured himself that he was "no worries" about rocking him, who is "a fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because doing twelve hours of flying after such an operation is not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure himself, claiming that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "endorsed".
Mr. Camus had also said that he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed a "little colon cancer" surgery and then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed the singer's difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: Bousquet's first on its fetish distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medallist at the 2009 World Championships in the Great Basin, won an international title on Thursday over a distance he particularly likes, the 50 m freestyle, during the Euro-2009 in small basin in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while waiting for a surge.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relays gentlemen 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, who was staring at the world record of the 50 m free, of which he holds the mark in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50 m free, it is the 28-year-old Frenchman who won in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet was ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world brand (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better and in this case, I said that if the world record was within my grasp, I would try it.
Just like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1.
At the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finished their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of combinations has not been used this time by the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the big basin this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer did not manage to lower the mark he holds over 400 m freestyle (3:32.77) but nevertheless won by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't really get into this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: Sarcophagus panel owned by Zola awarded US$1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging in particular to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded on Thursday 1.5 million dollars, well above its estimate, announced the art merchant Sotheby's.
This front panel of two meters long by 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world", explained to the AFP on Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice president of the Roman and Egyptian antique art auctions at Sotheby's.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one on which the buyers have bid the most so far, told the AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back a few days.
The panel remained almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively to the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bathtub in his Parisian mansion, and to Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
Remained a shadow zone of about fifty years.
By searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola Succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart".
Attempted aborted departure from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico considered that the conditions no longer existed for the transfer to its territory of the fallen President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied a safe conduct by the putschist government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for carrying out this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived Wednesday in El Salvador to take Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government plane left to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migrations.
The putschist government wanted to force Mr Zelaya to "resign" and to seek political asylum abroad in order to grant him a safe conduct.
But the fallen president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as guest head of state.
The putschist government "had another failure in wanting me to give up my office (...), they wanted me to resign", said Thursday Mr Zelaya on Radio Globo, on which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has been going on for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some chords the fallen president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, said on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, on Honduran Radio HRN.
I do not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to take place as President of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumours of Mr. Zelaya's departure had mobilized on Wednesday supporters of the fallen president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military reinforced their siege.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the putschist government's position.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had come closer to Venezuelan socialist president Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, the day he had organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he came back by surprise on 21 September and took refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he goes out, he will be arrested to answer for the crime of "high treason" accused of justice, according to the putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Mr Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with US trade balance figures showing the recovery of both the US and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced by 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, technologically dominant, by 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index awarded 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But it remains anecdotal, she tempered, believing that the market was focused on "half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on US trade balance figures, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The US trade deficit fell in October by 7.6% compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
In contrast, analysts expected the deficit to widen.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States increased against all expectations last week, reaching 474,000 applications.
But over the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest level in a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury Bill increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% on Tuesday evening and the yield of the 30-year bond to 4.492% compared to 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of power consummate the "Ladies in White" · Global Voices
On Thursday, a few hundred supporters of Cuban power consummated wives of political detainees gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which ten dissidents were arrested.
About 40 "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were consummated in the street by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they marched towards the centre of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP observed.
Down with the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Vive Fidel and Raul!" chanted, with a raised fist, the supporters of power to dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes agents who came "to ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighbourhood of Vedado, about ten dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for International Human Rights Day were arrested by plainclothes police officers, a journalist from the AFP observed.
The police forceed dissidents into civilian vehicles who were consummate by government supporters, according to the journalist.
Interrogations of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain under lockdown.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" for the sake of their declared enemy, the United States.
Sadly, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
Forced man kills an octogenary with a knife and wounds 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
A forceed man armed with two knives killed an octogenarian and wounded five other people in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hautes-de-Seine), at one hour's rush on Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant was allegedly beaten with two knives and, for unknown reasons, an octagenary, in or in front of a pharmacy on 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, was learned from police sources and witnesses.
Grievedly wounded, the old man, born in 1929 according to an official of the Alliance police union, died in hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, about thirty years old, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenary died.
The other injured person's days are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became ill and was reportedly hospitalized "in shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He reportedly injured two passers-by, apparently at random: one thirty-year-old and one four-year-old, the latter seriously.
The script remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he wore in cross behind his back, explained on site a leader of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies collected by the AFP, tried to control the forcible.
I saw a guy about thirty years old with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was strong, said Alberto, waiter of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Always boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of n°61, two municipal police officers, including their head, tried to question the armed man and were wounded with fists, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Some passers-by came to tell me there was a wounded person outside.
I went out, saw a 70-year-old on the ground, put her in a safety position, and I saw a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later a second person, about thirty years old, was wounded with a knife.
It was the National Police that arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office has referred the investigation to the Department of Judicial Police of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The forceed man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in custody.
A police source did not rule out his being interned in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six policemen to control him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
It was "in a state of overexcitation" as "all the forced of this species whose forces multiply under the effect of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer once again calls for the prosecution to be dropped
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again called on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), to drop the prosecution against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a matter of more than 30 years old.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", denounced before three judges of the Court of Appeal of the second district of California serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
I demand that the charges be dropped here and now, said Mr Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "were cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who had died since -- had discussed, before issuing his sentence, with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which was a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and wanted" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But at the end of September Mr. Wells had finally declared that he had "mented" the author of the documentary.
In case the court refused to drop the prosecution, Mr. Hummel requested a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, that no drop in charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old had fled from the United States in 1978, before his sentence was handed down, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He's never set foot in the United States since.
The Deputy District Attorney of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, said Roman Polanski "must be there to appear at the hearing."
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "requests a favor from the court, while disregarding her authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to render their decision -- also pointed out "that there were other alternatives to the flight."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one calling for the abandonment of the prosecution of Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, has also once again called for an end to the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer bears to be harassed at every turn of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends up without direction, restrained by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended up undirected on Friday, in a market tiring between better than expected indicators in the United States and the rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, noted Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which "helped to improve market opinion on the soundness of the economic recovery", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence rose significantly in December to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan Index.
The indices were, however, hampered by a further increase in the dollar, at the highest level in the last two months in the face of the euro, which "pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury Bill increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday evening and the yield of the 30-year bond to 4.497% compared to 4.492% the day before.
Miss World's election once again in South Africa
After a month of traveling through South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are about to cross the last straight line Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this grand mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sports or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a veritable whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was amazing.
I've seen so many things and had so many experiences!, exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to put my crown back on.
This experience has been fascinating.
I am happy to have experienced it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery "of breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Misses are now focusing on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both becoming Bollywood stars.
It's every woman's dream of being crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launches Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costumes and of course in swimsuits.
The show will be moderated by a TV presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and an official of the Miss World Committee Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to match, says Julia Morley, President of Miss World.
The candidates as last year did a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their greatest memory will probably remain the draw in Cape Town (south-west) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been with people I never thought I could get near.
I'm definitely going to come back for the 2010 World Cup, is excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive", according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive", assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport where he had to go to his father's bedside hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's going very well, told the press David Hallyday on his way out of the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13.00pm local (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured that he would go "very quickly" to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be re-operated during the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went on Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade was educated to attend a school show, a photographer from the AFP observed.
The head of orthopaedic and trauma surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catone, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer violently challenged Dr Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, said Mr. Camus.
I've heard of a possible judicial process to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus felt that Johnny Hallyday was "going far too fast to Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem with this trip and it was amazing to me, since I myself had two hernia discs, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "departed without drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the arts.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practising at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resolve a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, convicted several times by the courts, in medical liability cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Mr Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Doctors' Order, accused him of being "unscrupulous man" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of Order, and who is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Mr David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was "perfectly well done" and that post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The association UDF raises the tone and calls the New Center to no longer use its acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to OPA's attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardian party, calling on him not to use it on any support, under penalty of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
To support his approach, he received the support of Member of Parliament Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP transferred to NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF trademark for being the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday night, the office of the association UDF, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to let themselves be dispossessed, came out of its silence to issue a warning to the minister and the deputy, urging them no longer to use the acronym and to transmit to them the property of the brand, under penalty of prosecution.
In recent days, you have multiplied the statements indicating that you are going to propose to your political movement to take back the UDF acronym, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it appropriate to forward on your militant material and on the guard page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New center+, of the slogan +the UDF of today+, also notice the signatories of the mail.
As you are not unaware, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF office, which calls on the NC to "immediately withdraw the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as from (its) website".
He also asked Hervé de Charette "to pass on the ownership of (the) mark to its legitimate successors".
If you did not do so, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a political movement in its own right since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave him in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others did in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, continues the office, "when he filed the mark", he was no longer "member of the UDF for three years", but at the UMP.
He uses scandalously and fraudulently the abscence of deposit of the acronym UDF to perform it on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironing out on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for itself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled".
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses him, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenary to deprive her of part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by up to three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear each other apart while holding the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical examination of Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, should be conducted collegiately by three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, at least not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre prosecutor's office during the investigation.
Designated physicians on Friday will be required to submit a report by March 10, 2010, stating in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she'll do it.
I'm going to talk to her about it, and she told Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman, at the end of the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers's lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will demonstrate that he (Mr.Banier) manipulated this elderly lady who must be protected, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has brought criminal charges against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and a touch-to-all artist, whom she accuses of having taken advantage for years of her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt, for her part, has always refuted having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a long-time friend.
While the court had to consider the admissibility of the action brought by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleadings sometimes turned to great family unpacking on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Can you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her since her marriage."
For its part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office again held that the complainant was not entitled to take action, especially since in recent days a guardianship judge refused to grant her application to initiate judicial protection proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in her place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the big French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than a decade, the management attitude of large companies towards its employees has been reminiscent of the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of making employees adhere to "values" determined from above as it was formerly, of imposing on consumers products designed by the technicians of the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering the markets in the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from the factors of customer preferences returns regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives in particular.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires on the part of employees a commitment that the revenues of authoritarian management totally contradict.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put employees at the centre of the company's concerns on the same footing as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – incite this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
First of all, because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, every structure finally, after many detours, gets to do first and foremost... what it has always done.
- Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
Coming from the major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the United States 'neurosciences' and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "leviers" (sic) of the commitment of executives, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reinforces the leaders in a posture of mechanistic governance, inappropriate to the world today.
Identify and measure drivers of engagement
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, presupposes adopting a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It consists in integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental finding: for employees, commitment for the company is only possible if it is clearly seen as a means of realizing part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
At present, only the studies resulting from the Functional Pattern Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their business on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the business, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilising factors, business leaders can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and hand over their human resources management "to the place".
They thus create a favourable ground for the concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: "Just War" Worth Right Praise to Obama
On Friday, the American right welcomed Barack Obama's previous speech in Oslo, who was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who brokered the award to Obama on October 9, applauded the presidential speech this time, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice-president in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Mrs Palin, the right wing geriatric of the Republican Party, in the daily USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the topic of war "sometimes necessary" in her memoirs that have just been published.
War is, of course, the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be stopped there, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found the speech to be very good, welcomed the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some sides, I found this speech quite historic, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, was delighted to have seen "a leftist president" remind the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and would not be able to award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former George W. Bush converti columnist at the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it", said Mr Gerson.
Among the few on the right to be unconvinced, a Bush-era hawk, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "ternal, ampoule and uninspired" on the National Review Online site.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed at Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we wrap war in the notion of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained laudable to the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel was prematurely awarded to Obama, described his speech as "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression" has ignited the Californian daily.
Obama "made the right speech," said the New York Times, judging him "both gloomy and edifying."
Roads: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three negotiations-marathon sessions, the trade unions in the road sector and TLF, the only employers' organisation to have remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that puts an end to the slogan of strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday evening, Secretary of State for Transport Dominique Bussereau "rejoiced" this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, started Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators left in the early morning of Friday, hoping to sign the text of the agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
Even if three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took even more than six hours of a meeting that started at 11:00 a.m. for everyone to agree and at 6:00 p.m. the text to be signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "there was a concern that it would disrupt the end-of-year celebrations," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text foresees a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low wages, "from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but we're going from a long way, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
It's either we're going to order our militants that there's no blockade, no blockade of the food centres.
But we can still have some recalcitrants that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed "a good deal", even though it was "difficult to concede increases on high wages in view of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros monthly for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3%, and the maintenance of general conditions for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow in particular to address the question of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of 100 million euros in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending finance law for 2009, which was voted on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in identical terms".
TLF's signature allows the agreement to be applied first to companies affiliated with this organisation, and second to the whole profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "as soon as possible", said Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dupe market", as the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate urgently, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the turkey eaters of the next New Year, lamented the Unostra.
For the Otre, the agreement risks "to dig the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disturbances on the RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the second day of strike between trade unions and the RATP management left them on their hunger as to their demand for a premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important purchase weekend before Christmas, there will only be trains between 10:00 am and 8:00 pm, one in two trains on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one in four trains outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture, which will force passengers to switch trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which wait for 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is making efforts to serve department stores".
The RER A crosses from the west to the east of Paris.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains travelled during peak hours, and almost no trains in off-peak hours, as planned.
Like Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, the Francilians having organized themselves.
Thus in the early morning, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye station (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, especially because of the absence of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "an hour and thirty before, to make sure he arrived on time".
The station Saint-Lazare did not experience saturation, said SNCF, which had provided for the supervision of officers and law enforcement officers.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the Saint-Lazare train station to reach the metros.
New general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon, deemed to be "mighty" by the unions.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, who demand a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in brackets, outraged the CGT, stressing that the direction "was not doomed to solve a problem while in the truckers and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled Monday for "a broader examination of the conditions of practice of the profession", the RATP said.
This also made the trade unions say that the company "does not care about weekend users".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the Paris headquarters.
It was then that the management, which until then refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "for the sake of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to expand to the RER B on Tuesday, after notice is given by Unsa and Independents.
The trade unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the daily million travellers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, receive between 2,200 and 2,700 euros gross, as well as 600 to 650 euros in bonuses, for off schedule hours, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court pronounced the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision which was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-eastern part of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision may greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "foyer of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", told the press the president of the Court Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required for the dissolution, said Mr Kiliç, adding that 37 party leaders, including President Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "guidelines" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered as a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party assures that it has "no organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the Court comes at a time when the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to stop Kurdish support for the PKK and to put an end to the conflict.
DTP leaders had claimed that dissolution could lead to renewed tensions in southeast Anatolian, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the leader of the PKK Abdullah Öcalan have escalated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
As soon as the courts announced, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP's premises in Diyarbakir, the large south-eastern city, populated mostly by Kurds.
Law enforcement fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators threw molotov cocktails or stones, with fronds.
A hundred people also protested in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk asserted that the decision of the Justice would "enhanced despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this question (Kurdish, ndlr) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can, of course, expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a harsh winter.
But the head of the road clearing and sanding service (FES) says that it is not to bother the citizens.
It is simply so that agents can test the technique of vehicles and learn to master them well.
And according to the meterologists, it could be for this weekend.
More than 300 officers and 120 vehicles stand ready to attack snow and ice.
The FES follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr Brauburger explains that as soon as he starts snowing on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, large sandblasting vehicles run 20 main routes (known as routes A).
This includes busy streets, main arteries such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire-fighting access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES officers begin duty at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with a well-adhesive road melt in up to 3 hours of time.
This is why the FES service begins at 3 a.m. "so that the roads are cleared when the daily migration traffic begins".
Where it gets harder, it's when the snow starts falling at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the head of the road clearing and sanding department "because no motorist is willing to let the salting vehicles pass".
Then, if it no longer snows, access roads and service roads - like the Rat-Beil-Straße - are taken care of.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr Brauburger is well aware that this still causes a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES hiking team set off to clear priority areas deemed dangerous and passages.
As for bike paths, the services of the FES are generally unable to handle them.
Mr Brauburger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the condition of bridges between 22 o'clock and 0430.
Since ice is formed very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also call on this special service when necessary.
The cradle of dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae looked like other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long by 1.50m high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was equipped with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with claws in sickle and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin reports and his colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine, Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the supercontinental lands, the Pangea and was towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of the Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
In fact, he tells us about the relationship, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
In 2006, Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team tells us that sometimes they find a dozen bones in one day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
The researchers named him Tawa after the word Hopi Indians for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a very exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to some incomplete bone fragments.
Not all experts in paleontology share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he points out that it makes it possible to confirm certain theories concerning the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
However, most of the oldest fossils are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the very first dinosaurs.
The experts wonder, among other things, at what time the saurians were divided into three major evolutionary groups: the theropods (carnivores) which include the later tyrannosaure and the velociraptor, from which the birds, the sauropods, quadrupeds in the long neck, and those related to them and the herbivores ornithisches, which include species such as triceratops and stegosaure.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species has an interesting relationship of characteristics that are both primitive and developed, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers found evidence that Tawa hallae had small airbags in its bones at the level of the skull, as well as birds that are descendants of theropods.
These small pockets of air make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It appears that in Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small airbags in its bones.
Since the related lineage of the immense sauropods also possessed airbags and a light frame, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
Since the most primitive known dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers concluded that the saurians had appeared there.
As a result, the three major evolutionary lines divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, that is, all the land that formed the Pangae Supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the paleontologist team also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor that would have migrated, advance the researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History in New York and co-author of Science Studies magazine said there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says there is an even older species, the silesaure, which lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him this could give an erroneous view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while there are virtually no dinosaurs on other continents.
On the other hand, how did dinosaurs become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of present-day crocodiles and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Trias the dinosaurs spread throughout the planet thus promoting the development of many new species while others, which were related to them, disappeared between Trias and Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a massive extinction that the dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or else, dinosaurs were better suited and they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favorite meteorite blossoming of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and which since then had been vegetating in the shade: they were mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
There are those of lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec City, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the casino at the J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt makes waves all over the planet.
278 professors and teachers from J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English they condemn the intervention of the police demanded by the university's steering committee.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers on strike after walls and works of art had been barbed with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories consider that the degradations did not justify "such a violent intervention on the part of the police commando against the students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation is an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and teaching.
Focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitize and criminalize protest" and tries to make the reasons for mobilization forgotten.
The University's Steering Committee has thus avoided discussions that would be essential.
Court officers require that criminal proceedings be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not participate in the degradation.
Legitimation of protests
The young people of the Verdi trade union in the services sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
Protests are only a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Regional Secretary for Youth of the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took charge of the action initiated by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and deterioration of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday on the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism," said Regional Parliament MP Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD opposition, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Link)
Instead of thinking about the arguments and demands of the students, they are evacuated.
The Left Party has tabled a motion that calls on the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new Silicon-valley
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place for the search for secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
As of September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, a place of francfort science – with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Protocol of Close Collaboration".
The signatories were Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz Head of Project Section for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose main focus is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the rapidly expanding Russian market.
In contrast, Russian scientific companies wish to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
There are the Moscow Electrotechnical Institute, the large Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika firms.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literally translated "Green City") derives its name from the wooded hills at the heart of which the research centres are established.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The size of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be high enough.
For its supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, into a desperate chaos of construction sites for about ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
The head-end stations, with lanes ending in the city, had a reputation at the time of being the relics of 19th-century transport technology that had the effect of a brake hoof of modern rail traffic because it used to take a long time to get the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that's what you have to do.
This is why the head stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train crossing station, which is about half way on the Trans-European Rail Magistral between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project is really going to begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long been incompatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of burying the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, head-of-the-line stations are no longer a real problem of entry and exit since there are modern, reversible trains with railcars and pilot car at both ends.
However, the construction of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and communal policies have prevailed.
The railway company is in the party because it is the taxpayer who incurs the costs of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From the urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – according to computer-generated planners’ graphs – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the expansion of the section are designed for trafficking in persons, which was, and is typical of the 1980s, an enormous growth.
At the time there was not yet competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than trucking on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabian project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other junctions and congestion points in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport's list.
One of the most important is the widening of the section through the Rhine Valley by 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be very urgent to press the fungus thoroughly here.
But project S21 has the effect of a braking hoof.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of international freight traffic in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews judgment on airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government raised the possibility of appealing to the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Court concerning the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the coalition CDU/FDP had instructed experts to examine from a legal point of view the judgement rendered by the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document with more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case where the proposed construction of the northwest landing runway at Frankfurt airport would take place.
The authorisation of 17 aircraft from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nocturnal air pollution.
The coalition must have decided by 4 January if it wishes to appeal against the judgment.
The opposition criticises this deadline and tries to pressure the government representative to appeal to the Federal Administrative Court of Leipzig.
The leader of the parliamentary group SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel calls on the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections to ban night flights, otherwise it will be deemed a total breach of a given word.
It is quite difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's election slogan "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's criticism that the Land government is still trying to allow night flights by using "avocassery and roubles".
It takes time to conduct a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "first quick impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of its fraction's statements on the prohibition of night flights is completely wrong.
U.S. banks repay aid
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, are losing their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully repaid 45 billion dollars (over 30 billion Euros) to the Treasury, corresponding to the assistance provided under the Tarp rescue plan.
The American television channel CNBC indicated during a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid received.
Banking institutions are thus seeking to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the sums, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to managers as well as the settlement of higher fees.
The Bank of America launched an increase in capital through the sale of securities to investors, which brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the sum comes from the bank's credit unions, which are well filled by the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, Managing Director of the Bank of America, expressly thanked the American taxpayers: the injection of capital has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution assumed its capacity by buying the Merrill Lynch investment bank at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup is also planning to obtain money on the financial markets in order to free itself from state supervision.
As of Thursday, the US bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase, reporting the CNBC channel citing the banking community.
The spokesperson for Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
By June Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
In the end, it all happened faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current incumbent of the post of editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey who runs ZDF's Berlin editorial was the big favorite.
However, the channel did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a willingness not to further harm ZDF steward Markus Schächter should the proposal not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14 members of the Commission.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years, but this was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had expressed their support for the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted against. Brender's removal by vote was a far-reaching but predictable failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is the majority on the Board of Directors, had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to take Brender back to his post.
Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly regarded editor-in-chief on the grounds that the rate of listening to ZDF news programmes had fallen under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, casting a shadow over the increasing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end, there were even 35 experts in public law who had interfered in the debate and who felt that Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it won't have served anything.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (radio organ of Rhineland-Palatinate) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily national).
In 1983 he became editor of the ZDF first of all in the news magazine "heute-journal" (newspaper of today).
From 1988 to 1990 he was deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then until 1998 he was chief and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bimonthly news programme presented in the morning); until 2001 he was head of the foreign policy department of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial.
After Brender's disgrace, when he had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialist magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch's opponent on the Board of Directors, Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of political figures from the ZDF monitoring committees.
Peter Frey, the probable successor of Brender had skillfully handled the Board of Directors by criticizing the commission vehemently in its decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as well as the Board of Directors could elect him without being supposed to place a political partisan in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a left-wing liberal.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the conference of rectors, an agreement was drawn up stipulating that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of examinations: a single examination should be used to close the study module chosen.
In addition, the workload will have to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also undertaken to organise more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor's and Master's courses.
At regional level, there must be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Länder's education ministers and university rectors have constantly expressed the fashionable expression: "stuability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to have a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module should normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", can we read in a document of about 30 pages on the future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, we should be able to stop the slippages, which significantly harmed the studyability.
In addition, "stuability" should be the decisive criterion for the organization of studies in the future.
Modules as well as the background need to be carefully examined to see if one can avoid this feeling of suffocation that one sometimes feels in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition considers that the Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and flexibility to allow and encourage personal initiative".
The new regulations will cover access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing ones.
These cycles must be "re-accredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory which depend on the accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to put pressure on the agencies so that the programmes were not too busy and the examination system was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate has so far been the only Land to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities have to organise tutorial programmes and strengthen educational guidance offices as well as examination offices and the international relations department.
The Länder and universities have a budget of EUR 10 million for this purpose.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wanted to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
As a result, only one examination will be required to complete his studies.
The organisation of studies must be more flexible, and it must be possible to guarantee the recognition of transcripts from other higher education institutions and access to the Master's degree must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "stuability" of all university cycles should have been examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the question of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated, but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students has indicated that he would like to see the organisation of education policy no longer "behind the closed doors" of ministers and university rectors in the future.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as concerned persons should be able to express themselves a little.
Future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of students is very useful to us", she said on Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a common reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for each graduate Bachelor to enrol in a Master's degree.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder ensure that today's Bachelor students will have enough places tomorrow for Master's studies and as good study conditions as possible.
The Länder must therefore hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of reducing access to the Master's degree.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with these words "Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he thematizes in bits of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who gained freedom but lost at the same time his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a professor of German and English in Bucharest and later a collector at a youth publishing house before moving to Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry from the Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the artist's house in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the deforming mirror of your Securitate files".
Obviously destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged before his fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner was awarded the German Language Prize in 1989 in conjunction with some of the participants.
Enrollment trials began insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, "so someone who has not been able to withstand enough of the intimidation trials of the Security."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honour of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his exemplary literary intermingles with the mechanisms of dictatorship power, the literary scene is shaken, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and lowsse of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from current knowledge, not only guilty but also victimized.
In his own dossier Securitate, IM Walter played a role, assured literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favour.
"He had been able to pull him out of all the difficult situations at the time," Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before this audience was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of his own file.
We can assume that the victims will have made speculations and sometimes guessed what real names were last hiding the names of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
In contrast to Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been constantly thwarted and slowed down in previous years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was set up to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS), but the return of the files has since dragged on.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very disdainful way towards the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it was possible to express itself here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Of course, many inescapable issues are associated with the Söllner case as happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been dispossessed? The weighted reaction of the listeners, at Söllner's admission, let us hope that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
Tumultes at the Champions League
It seemed that a representative was coming there, shot at four pins straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread out his goods when the new coach VFB Christian Gross climbed at midnight minus a quarter into a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier by hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, let himself drive into the city which was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our quinquagenarian could have taken the wheel himself – he had not drunk alcohol and he was not drunk of happiness either.
He had had a nice evening, but tomorrow we had to get back to work.
Because it's now that it's about to start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just engaged three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth in the final", that is to say in the league of champions thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall back".
The "big job" is waiting for us on Sunday.
Here it is a question of repeating to Mainz the results of the league of champions on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three quick goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Drawing by lot
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16./17. + 23./24 February/retour game 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on December 18. in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel's successor's fulminant entry into office was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only in the lucky one, who had passed on to the destabilised Stuttgart professionals, an unfailing motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them that they had to focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "Plumbing of souls" – Gross – the recipe for success that sounded so well but that no longer had any effect with the nurse Babbel.
He triggered a certain magic, admits Jens Lehmann - Babbel's supporter -, "in football when there is a new impulse sometimes happens things that one would never have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of break for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" observed by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "It is someone who takes action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the course, warned manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs tenacity.
Like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with the 0:4 , objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, pointed out that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We have not yet passed the difficult course.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday doesn't have the heart to party, even after the first home victory in three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a television interview with goaltender Jens Lehmann bounced back just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others take and not Jens, counter-carriage Heldt, in response to Lehmann's bitter criticism.
He accused the management of style weakness and said that she had decided to change her coach under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also considered it a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his free day after the matches had been suppressed.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness" and announced consequences for the goaltender.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends for life these two quadragenaires.
In any case, they agreed with everything else, i.e. without the group's previous work by the replaced coach, strong sports and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "to a large extent in success" retort Heldt and Lehmann in choir – and even the man in the plastic bag acquiesced.
Heavyweight World Championship
Warm battle in Bern: Kevin Johnson challenged him constantly verbally and gestually with world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds Ukraine defended its title as world champion of heavy goods vehicles according to the version of the WBC federation.
By unanimity of the judges he insisted on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as world champion of heavy goods vehicles.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a single-point victory against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time, Klitschko has been defending his title with honour since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously Ukrainian had already won twice the title of World Champion of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately he didn't succeed in the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, 39 times winner in 41 professional battles, had to confess twice his defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Arena of Bern, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted above all to dictate the fight, from the height of its 2.02 meters, by its left counter.
Johnson, eleven centimeters smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champ's blows, thus preventing Klitschko from bringing into play his dangerous right-hand side.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, tried mostly to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his blows rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having surpassed with Klitschko the distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko calling him "bad zombie" who "is not really capable".
During the weighing on Friday, the champion couldn't help but provoke Johnson by knocking his sunglasses off his nose "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered "his" WBC belt which he had previously had to abandon without a fight.
This year, defending his title as champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just took a hit in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His reverence is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having detonated the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Haye cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko which was due to take place in September.
It would appear that his promotion company is now planning to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Green parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused Defense Minister Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz Affair.
The SPD and La Gauche (die Linke) parties ask the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz air attack, the opposition accused Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a counter-truth" on the deadly strike of two tanker trucks last September, said the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD chain "Tagesschau" (the 8pm newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report which NATO has at its disposal and which has been read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the aim of the strike was in reality not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured in the American air attack, which was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
On Saturday, the Greens, the SPD and the Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to speak in the Federal Parliament as soon as possible and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and her colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Government if the chancery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancery has in no way influenced the army's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were increasing voices expressing doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had provided to Guttenberg concerning the attack on the tankers was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden some embarrassing details from the Minister.
In the entourage of the two senior officials, it is suggested, however, that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert has meanwhile requested in a letter a clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these charges and referred to the Federal Parliament's committee of inquiry, which would be convened the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The worlds of the dream
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the psychically ill, or under the influence of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie down in our darkened rooms, we can unfetteredly indulge in the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, the one who, awakened, experiences the state of dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in the psychically ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes incites the limits between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can be presented in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and effect stand out, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitting substances of the brain - in the first place dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - breaks and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts often occur during schizophrenic psychosis.
The Earth's attraction force no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakened; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
It's autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic book character.
His body is in two dimensions with loud colors.
The Earth's attraction no longer has power over it, it hovers at the ceiling.
He's feeling a blow.
Behind him are winged, grimating devil creatures, bloody mouth, showing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Sounding voices, mean, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of its stereo chain, makes it a loop and attaches it to a hook fixed to the ceiling.
He goes up on a baffle and runs the buckle around his neck.
He's jumping.
The buckle's loose.
Let it be a lesson for you, shout the voices in a choir to rip off the eardrum. "Go to a clinic and get treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has lived six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, moreover it is manic-depressive, it takes medication against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
Approximately one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitation, which makes them suffer hallucinations, megalomania, relationship madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter out disruptive signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the psychiatry department of the Heidelberg University Hospital (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is in the centre of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time it finds itself in a passive role, it is like a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience a hallucination once in his life.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is basically preserved".
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real setting.
Why does our brain make these kind of convertibles, is always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to temporarily lose their perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the individuals involved have minimal brain damage.
It is assumed that neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is the way in which the abnormal neuronal system occurs and, moreover, the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, however, if there is predisposition.
Similarly hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains get hot.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive medicines to get rid of them while others buy very expensive drugs to get rid of them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
For ten years, Kasten has been gathering reports on hallucinations and illusory image phenomena: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The unreal world in our head".
Hallucinations are well among the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also an impressive number of many other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising to note that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions, are hyperactive or not sufficiently refrened; when our brain heats but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as a brain injury or psychosis.
But also lack of stimulus, stress, love sorrows or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants acknowledge having experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old and lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania and goes to high school.
A young girl everything to do normal, actually.
If there weren't images and voices.
During recreation, a young boy, thin, with long chestnut hair, may speak to him.
When she answers her comrades look at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a whimsical dreamer, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl who is sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this young man friendly.
Am I crazy?, she wonders sometimes.
But she knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night apparitions are, in general, frightening.
Often visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to take the class because the teacher is just presenting a new student in his eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations to the table.
At night apparitions are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for sleep that happens too rarely and far too late, she can often not make the distinction if she is awake or dreaming already, if the images she sees, the faces grinning or the young girl with bloodthirsty cuts on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she yells at these creatures.
She doesn't tell her parents or friends, they'd think she was crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact with psychologist Kasten on the internet, she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the probability is high that they will have hallucinations after some time.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, makes sure there's animation.
Sarah K., the only girl, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played on her own.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was of thinking age, was not her real father.
It is the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience", according to Kasten "has taken place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychoses.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That's why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness we unfortunately quickly tend to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and physician head of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious illness, painful but which also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oniroid form of experience, a particular form of modification of the consciousness awakened by the dream.
Oniroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is in a state of awakening.
The oniroid state of consciousness occurs during trauma or in situations of extreme pathology, as for patients with fully conscious polyradiculopathy, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and of the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that undermines his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It's a mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
In fact, it is an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, a capacity of organization that is given to us, to us men, so as not to sink into the nothingness of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
Zurich's art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as a saving action of the soul.
He is 49 years old, when his conscience leaves for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain immobile in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he has created from all parts, visit foreign places, travel in time. He sees himself as an old man bed in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages among nobles who make blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a Greek motorcycle who takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the neve of the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It completely absorbs itself in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen these interior journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes, describing what he has experienced.
On the contrary of dreams, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and intensive than real life.
The intensity of this experience sheds light on the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oniroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a state of sleep.
Any change in the state of consciousness, says psychologist Kasten "can cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snow can fall
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over from the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of the Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly committed to becoming part of society," said Hubert Burda, 69, at the Spiegel.
All details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
It will also be necessary to see if they are capable of doing so.
One cannot impose his children on 7500 collaborators without knowing whether they have the capacity to take care of them.
This would demolish children as well as the company.
Burda had indicated last Thursday that he was retiring from the post of President-Director-General in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technology sector.
Later he took care of the treasury sector, that is, he was responsible for the company's capital and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's departure he also took the lead in marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
Thus, for the first time, it is not a family member who is at the head of the Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, respectively, her son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's name is also used to link the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda states that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families that have been driven by a bulimia of capital, which have made huge unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
This has never been my strategy.
I never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I do not see myself in the role of the country's tutor as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken on too much importance.
Integrative beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the objective that El Corte Inglés has set itself, which has just opened in Callao shopping centre (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food section, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relax area in order to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, it is 250 m2 divided into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide customers' steps, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos show us how to perform our exercise program properly.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching), are enough to work all the muscles of the body.
And if, after having made our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi sign has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Various decorations
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated cleavage. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, get the electric car
The company Endesa, in collaboration with the Ayuntamiento in Barcelona, created the "Oficina LIVE".
It is a project to develop and promote electric vehicles in the Catalan capital.
The "Oficina LIVE" (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the installation of the electric car in the city and will put in place agreements concerning mobility, by carrying out steps, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "Electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will get involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVE Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
The company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa is involved in promoting the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has ongoing a series of complementary projects such as the G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a future of tranquility" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a peaceful future" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
During the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without a plan for the competitiveness of the automotive sector, we would now have a landscape of abandonment and closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can envisage a peaceful future for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integrated Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), has allocated EUR 800 million to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilised an investment of more than EUR 3 000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended for both the development of new models and the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles on the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased by "40%" in November.
20,000 m2 of vintage cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Exhibition of Collected Cars, a meeting place for professionals and enthusiasts of the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at Pabellón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only will it be possible to find vintage motorcycles and automobiles, but it will also be possible to find in ClassicAuto Madrid items of any kind related to the world of the engine.
Thus, at the exhibitors of the pavilion, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make the happiness of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, automotive sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, automotive sales and catering, or Cochera Clásicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
External aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this show will also include parallel activities: rallies, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Proficiency tests with automobiles and collector motorcycles will also be conducted on a circuit outside the exhibition centre.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sport spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sporting spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the engine shut-off and start system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is only available on the 150 horsepower gasoline 2.0 engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good rating it has achieved as a whole.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixing.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control board and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
This is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to surpass.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this is a large chest with regular shapes.
The automatic engine shut-off and start system, at least for the moment, is only available on the two-litre, 150-hp petrol engine with manual change of six speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its finesse, its low noise, its performances and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the Mazda3 most demanded are diesel models, those who do not perform a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Concerning the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, i.e. the one with the highest number of standard elements.
Among the standard equipment, the Track Changer Assistant (VMA), which removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly noteworthy.
Moreover, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes, among other elements, bi-xenon headlights and a BOSE audio system with disk charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
In particular, it is illustrated by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not operate many kilometres per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 150 horsepower gasoline 2.0 engine.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between 21 770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23 270 euros for the model tested, the Sportive.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
Luxury « Premiere »
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever dazzled us, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as ever, had opted for a dark "lady".
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows to watch its email, without offering the possibility of even seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see him on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, which is less than half of what the iPhone data subscription costs, for example.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the The Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third embodiment.
It is just as limited as his American grandfather, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately look for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) so they can access their mail.
The idea of a fixed price roaming is incredibly attractive and it has been working for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
Repeated reminders from the European Commission to propose affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we're not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have Wifi) offers this type of rates, means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals allowing them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no trouble.
This is a connected device and you pay when you buy it, not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a lifetime access shopping option as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a more just formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is, no doubt, the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the office of Barack Obama as President of the United States with a dress and a coat of that color, she chose, in fact, the same one to accompany him in the second moment, without a doubt, the most important of her life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on these two occasions: besides their similar color, a yellow pulling towards the green with brilliant reflections, on both occasions, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So at first glance, it seems that the first lady of the United States follows the wake of Princess Asturias and has chosen to put on the same outfits.
But the fabric in which both sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick lace for taking office, on the other hand, it wore a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with medium heel for the first occasion, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now raised while she was wearing them released the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for young women who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study "Fécondité et career professionnelle des femmes en Espagne", carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, carried out on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers have had their professional careers limited because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of couple life and the number of children, whether the woman is working or not, and the type of job she is employed.
Those who do not work outside the home, work part-time or have little stable work, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women in stable employment, mainly in the public sector, push back entry into marriage and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling in a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector."These data show that women in stable employment needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised largely influences maternity, but less the date of beginning of a common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years respectively on average.
"Another distinction also emerges between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary education marry and have their first child before finding stable employment, those who have completed middle- and upper-level studies reverse this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the brand, atoning the universal motto "Because I'm worth it".
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, thus joins other celebrities registered at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if select were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr.Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
British fashion prices
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His greatest representatives, creators and models, both yesterday and today, gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vincent's Ace Poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de asses (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have traversed his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
It does not do so according to the foreseeable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by seeking something similar to the core of the created character's ignition.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither fear nor illumination.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and rereading.
I'll leave you a few snapshots here.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same one that I felt without naming it: pleasure against fatal destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand metre peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north face, on which the best mountaineers still let go and always take it."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
On his own, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and on other occasions that he was the son of a black and crocodile.
These two dreams were great."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer gathered the crève dement pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo until the end of the night of the 20th century, in its literary form, and he did so in the flight of himself and invoking post-eriority with a violent speech to the maggots."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed, "Beloved God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser: "The sleep after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after the life, tired death delights."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally that she told her that Edward VII was spying on her between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We've never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was beyond madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it wasn't to try to hide Joyce from Baroja?
What else would it be if Faulkner had Baroja shot?
What did this do, except to aspire the glory of this man to serve him as a pedestal?"
A cowardly assault
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people aged between 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, a mele-blood, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they beat her two kicks that left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what fun there is to attack for free a small defenceless animal that was also on a leash.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energumen who attacks an animal is able to do the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., on a Tuesday like any other, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been moaning all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint with the police station in the neighborhood, even though we doubt that this is of great use and in order not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly assassins were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is going on among young people so that they find it fun to treat a defenceless animal for free, which gives us affection, friendship and company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, helmet sets
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as the two structures have indicated today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing helmets, as this is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is in line with its commitment to road safety, which " goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products" and stated that it contributes to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet in two wheels, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure the widest possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are increasing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6 per cent compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employers' union of the Anfac manufacturers and Ganvam, that of the dealers.
However, the good news should be nuanced, since the benchmark used for comparison in November 2008 was particularly poor, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound of last month, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, adding all vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (passenger cars, pick-up trucks, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95,853 have been sold.
The big clouds that most affect their demand have not dissipated, however, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of cases pay through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in limiting bank loans, there are other factors to be added, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In view of this situation and the difference between passenger vehicles, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E has not been used very much.
In addition to individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre may also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) was reiterated.
The dealer association foresees a year 2010 similar to the one that ends, for which it calculates a drop in sales (tourist vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency brake aid is now mandatory
As has been done with the ABS anti-lock brake system and as will be done with ESP stability control, emergency braking support systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been set until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure, imposed by the European Union, is to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear impacts.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the brake pressure in the event of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the kick given by the driver.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study by the Bosch car component manufacturer, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident were unable to press the brake before the collision, and half of them did not take advantage of its full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The aid intervention, by going back, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of element, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: one in four accidents with injured persons would be calculated to be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, by means of radar or camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps him by increasing the pedal pressure, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is unavoidable, the device exerts the maximum force on the brakes in order to minimize damage.
General Motors rejects the Opel plan until January
While the workers of the Opel factory in Figueuelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably on the 8th – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude Opel's rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be submitted first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the American manufacturer to take a decision as quickly as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with possible new buyers.
One of them might be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the application of Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, supported by Russian group Converg, is gaining importance.
In the event that there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
Driving the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest and precious jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to thin it with nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to do without, in the first place, the automatic roof, which was replaced by a hand-painted roof, allowing them to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, another 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of wins, to mount sports bacquets, still 12 kilos, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, earning another six kilograms and replacing the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual clutch PDK, the test was performed on a six-speed manual gearbox model, mainly on roads in California's secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly twisty turns.
His behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car from riding on the ground with a plumb.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we tested such a small and lightweight model which, at the same time, guarantees as much safety in turns, including at high speed.
He's a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at low speed for the time we need, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
This is what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Motor sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is abrupt, either when stopped or when recovered.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The pavement of the roads we travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car handled the chicken nests well.
Electronic assistants were barely present on the entire route, while on some turns we found ice in the early morning and gravel later in the morning.
In the end, an ultra-light car, the most entertaining to drive, which is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of €70,831.
Bag Girl
An intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house shows, the singer displays her face of bad girl with as much capacity as her Chanel bags.
More than a Bad Girl or an It Girl, it's a Bag Girl.
Baskonia takes victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant triumph at 91-82 during her visit to the hard ground of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic. She is thus at the head of her group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight three-point baskets was the best of his team (29 of evaluation).
The Vitoria team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and collective work, even though it had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 three-point baskets scored, largely determined the final victory.
The game began quickly for the blues and reds, who took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of Vitoria's team were marked from the perimeter was a sign that they had jumped into Israeli terrain with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's indoor game and Eliyahu's work, which was received by cheers and applause back to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to be noticed as the best player in his team, with 13 points scored, although Splitter's "less six" rating already signalled that this night was not going to be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria's team that we don't win so easily on their field, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the yellows taking advantage of the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from dead, needed to chain up some skillful actions to get the air, and it was at that point that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun appeared which, with three consecutive three-point baskets and the help of English and Ribas gave the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the locals succeeded in accentuating at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play for the whole thing in the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they would not tire anyone of what they had deserved for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign themselves and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis got closer in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against the Olympiacos and gave him the lead of Group B of the Euroligus, in a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the indoor game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the size of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter, made it possible to dream the Andalusians. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the interior game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to overturn the score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to operate by showing its superiority in both camps, while the injury exit of the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal faults weighed on Unicaja.
Indoor players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, created the 44-32 advantage in the nineteenth minute.
An impossible recovery
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos, who, despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to equal the difference of the meeting held in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, causing the leader of the group to stumble.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the encounter.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis's support, left some hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was almost impossible because the Olympiacos was relentless when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine having the largest number of classified real estate ads, jobs and vehicles in Spain.
The tool "How much should you be paid?" calculates user salaries from more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you have to register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For a week since the application has been running, the search engine has detected that, as a general rule, the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45 226 gross euros per year and a French one, 31,059, while a Spanish one receives 24 000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34 247 euros gross annually in England, 25 751 in France and 16 420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid work in Spain is that of server, with 11 592 euros net yearly, followed by that of seller, with 14 725 euros, and that of worker, with 15 667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are that of driver, part-time and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overturned president will have to abandon the diplomatic delegation by 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term.
Francisco Catunda, head of business at the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, told TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he has to leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since 21 September, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, at the end of his mandate, he must seek another destination."
The channel also quoted the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: "My position is to leave as quickly as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the 29 November elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, in the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After days of uncertainty since last spring, in which asset inflation has been the dominant market score, uncertainty has arisen again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about an uncertain future by nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been virtually finalised and, without calling into question their non-conformist liquidity policy, are beginning to put some sand in the workings, as the ECB has done, with their one-year auction next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction in risk premiums.
Stock exchange volatility and corporate bond spreads are increasing again, although they remain far removed from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
There is again a shift towards quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the safe havens chosen by investors, provoking an increase in the differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely hit by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened with a further downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the advocates of moral risk, who were again trying to provoke a case of conscience among those responsible for world economic policy who had slowed down the destructive effects of credit limitation on the destruction of employment, whereas what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the rose pot.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area member country to fail to meet its commitments.
What makes sense, however, is that the Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt gaps increase to the extent of European corporate bonds, we do not have to worry.
If European differences narrowed and ours continued to increase, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery models and to revise upward their forecasts for 2011, with in addition the OECD and the European Commission, which are coming back to the burden with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not augurate much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment "precaution is a mother of safety".
Connected sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday, before the sub-committee of the Congress of Deputies, where the energy strategy of Spain is discussed these days for the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán sketched for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommission, eight-close.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 million euros until 2020 and 60 000 million more between that date and 2030, in the event that nuclear power plants now in operation remain open.
If not, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
Starting in 2020, the issue will change, and the power will have to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal power plants, with mechanisms for carbon dioxide recovery and, above all, renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that an additional 18,000 MW are needed, along with other "supportive energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Law that the government has just approved is in line with what his company wants, did not wish to attack the royal decree aimed at encouraging the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this direction, despite the "one-off" measures, as the President of Iberdrola described them.
In any event, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although they are long-term, should start to be taken, as they take some time to reach maturity and that a stable pay framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling market at ten airports
Swiss company Swissport, Ferrovial's subsidiary for airport services on land, will play the role of privileged partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaborative protocol to create the Centre for Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures.
The alliance expects an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to conduct energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes for its first highway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first highway concession in Australia, a market on which it is already working as an energy company and water manager.
The project at stake is a tunnel estimated at A$1,700 million (approximately €1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and highway dealer.
The City Hall wishes to be able to dispose of these by the end of 2014.
After choosing the public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Ernest & Young, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 047 million euros) and in the last phase confronts three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only smooth Spanish company, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest manufacturers, while the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe's leading underground construction specialists.
Against Acciona's team, the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer group Bouygues, is building.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major construction projects and privatizations, but entering them is a major difficulty, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which still remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just won a place in this market by its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona relies on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the area of desalination.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waura (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the grouping of companies responsible for erecting and managing Adelaide's desalinator, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The toll underground road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the Northern Link (north link), is intended to link the western highway from Toowong to the peripheral road at Kelvin Grove (see map), per 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the Administration indicates that the tender will take place in the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be opened to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will consist of two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide $A 500 million (€308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to grow widely Hochtief, who mentioned yesterday the contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national fibre optic broadband network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have quick access to the Internet and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has divested the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the town of Brisbane. Work has not yet begun and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for an amount of EUR 64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after having been given the task of widening the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The project is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Sra. Rushmore gets adjudicated Renfe's advertising
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, said the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was chosen from 16 agencies that presented themselves to the tender organized by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity over the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Télécom to curb competition
France Télécom was fined €63 million by the French competition regulator for its anti-competitive conduct in the country's Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony through the signing of exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it places on its competitors.
The sanction imposed yesterday has also been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore repeat offenders.
An application shop
On the other hand, the mobile phone subsidiary of the French company followed the trail of other operators and opened an Internet application shop, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, Orange's application shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries like Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has brought 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation.
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have won 467.4 million, which puts them in third and fifth place of the clubs that have taken the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
Indeed, the competition allocated €5,362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish teams) who have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third in the continent to earn the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams which, moreover, charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend $413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification games (including the Atlético de Madrid) received $2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth of the finals receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarter final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are spent.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four seats.
The champion of the previous year took 40% of the allocated money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other game will be paid based on the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the offer to purchase shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not require it to issue a public bid (PPO) for all securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers €1.5025 per share, which will be paid in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this carry-over.
Yesterday, Sos' shares ended at €1.85; Nueva Rumasa's offer therefore estimates the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects Sos' actual valuation.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of the securities.
CNMV stated that it had not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company stated that it had contacted the regulator.
If it were to take place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos's capital is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos is continuing to restructure its management.
In an attempt to remain outside of possible offers of purchase and goes and comes judicially from its former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as Internal Audit Director.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a leadership position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will be directly dependent on the group president.
And it is not free from controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the supposed diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal further misappropriation of funds cannot be ruled out.
Concerning credit to the Salazars, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the JCC and Unicaja) said yesterday in front of the National Hearing that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing its destination.
CNMV authorizes Paternina's exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorised the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it allowed this transaction because it understood that its terms were in line with current standards and that it considered the contents of the explanatory sheet submitted to be "sufficient" as a result of the amendments implemented on December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95 % of the share capital, composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, and that they could not in any way be transmitted before the finalisation of the offer, of which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of automobiles that have suffered a loss are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each claim is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and labour time can be a long and complex work.
Calculation by hand of the cost of a repair between 20 000 and 30 000 euros, including parts and labour can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the help of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use these types of systems.
Providers of services and solutions for the assessment of claims and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
The other companies competing in the field of assessment tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial manager of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous 15 years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very difficult job, because it is necessary to catalogue each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and record its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image of each model is created that can be clicked on the different parts of a passenger car.
If it is a massively sold model, the work can be ready within a week if the process moves forward very quickly.
If it is a low-sold car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information about Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in use, the figure exceeds 99 per cent.
To carry out the work of documentation and development of databases, Audatex has eight centres throughout the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas, Madrid.
There, more than 100 technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests $90 million each year to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer different products.
The most common application is repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing the break parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does so in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting schedules.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is €5.75, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiates its award with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it is removed from the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows to bid on vehicles declared wrecks.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geo-demographic analyses or knowing common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious claims for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to developing such tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of accidents, breakdowns or car maintenance.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its volume of business has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the past three years, with a turnover of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it began its internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex, for his part, was born in Germany in 1966 and moved to Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be 557 million dollars, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Solera Group was listed on a stock exchange of $1,000 million, and today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, he has been on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark.
Internet Auctions of Accidental Cars
Last October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of damaged cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimation and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, breakage and professional sellers, who must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650 000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 vendors and 4000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collected cars can be re-recorded, although they have been removed, after complex steps.
garage price in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex guarantees that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are resistant to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, increases or discounts, and then he can print the quote to hand it over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated labour time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to make these images in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and rotate it to see the inner face.
