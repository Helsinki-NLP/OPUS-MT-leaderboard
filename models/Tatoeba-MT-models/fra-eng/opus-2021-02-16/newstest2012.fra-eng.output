Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the liberation of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament refused, as part of an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph relating to the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
MEPs refused in second reading the proposed amendment to reduce penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having concluded a seemingly disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgement is not final and the court must decide on the appeal of the convicted in December.
Tymosenko described the ruling as political revenge of the regime and provoked a process of suspicions of bias of the court also in the west.
The plan to annul paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was sentenced, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victory
Libyan liberation or rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners have yet to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners of the elections are Islamists, but are they moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the customary right of Sharia and we already know what this is about.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because for a robbery we cut off the hand.
Women can forget emancipation, the possible non-respect of faith are punishable by capital punishment...
It is the Qur'an that will unite in place of the dictator's personality the society composed of opposite tribes.
In Libya there will be such an order as we cannot represent ourselves and as we would certainly not like.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not benefit Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors have accepted aid with recognition of unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an Americian general who directed the NATO strikes, but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated in every attack.
When it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shooting, served Islam and our hairy turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not militarily occupy Libya.
So there is no problem for the premises to get rid of the "crossers".
Will oil companies have easy access to black Lebanese gold without land use?
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of the protection of the human rights concerned.
As long as we prevent these followers of sharia from doing so.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are in the focus of investors.
A tornado of statistics was held on Tuesday on Europe.
Each of the states published the GDP relativity information for the 3A.
The Czech economy stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market beats every record.
Investors look not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries published earlier their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is forecast to grow by 0.5%, while France's GDP is forecast to grow by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the forecast of 0.1%), however France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (which was a question of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that we are moving towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter according to planned and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which was what analysts had predicted.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
The yield on bonds over 10 years is 28.45%
The bond yields of Spain and Italy are rising to critical limits.
Problems start to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
The yields of Czech bonds remained below 4% while the situation in the region worsened.
There are voices in Germany that the ECB should be the guarantee of last resort .
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The performance of football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to the super Cech and goaltender Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has been very hard to defend with a lot of luck in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European championship.
IHLED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and much luck for the second.
The Czech performance also won thanks to the super Cech and hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification at the European championship.
The Montenegrins were under pressure until the second part because of a precise Czech defence.
The vicitmes of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances of scoring a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech performance will not be absent at the European championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football fund.
From the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
It was difficult for both teams to mount combinations and the game focused mainly around the central line.
The pressure of the national footballers failed to break through the Czech defence, which responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred university students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from Ispahan universities created a human shield Tuesday around the nuclear technology centre in Ispahan where uranium is transformed.
They thus openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclear program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has noted in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
Israel is reporting a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear programme, the targets would not only be Ispahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
Feeding a obese child: does not have breakfast and takes meat for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9-13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren are above average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This again shows how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the models that surround him is.
On the tables of obese children, for example, we find charcuterie 50% more often than in families of children with normal weight.
19% of the obese had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness action "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of the big kids the sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most schoolchildren today - only 15% replied that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and involved 900 pupils from primary schools in Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", action supported by General Health Insurance and Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children is the absence of a proper diet and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned indicate for example eating 5 times a day breakfast-in case - lunch - snack-dinner, which is a basic principle of a good diet", says one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast and cold meats at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that a healthy development requires some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of the students' families eat at the same time.
In most families each takes breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been noted is that one tenth of the population does not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast, however, is the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that the families of obese children consume unhealthy fries more often.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks sweet drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children questioned do sports regularly but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food from opportunities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating".
Among their favorite dishes are many cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming is in particular a high preference for sweet lemonade", is indicated in the results of the survey.
For lunch it is the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
Children did not want starches at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Towards health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
"During a review of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness-raising session "Obesity is not a coincidence", there was a determined willingness to move towards a healthy diet", the results of the survey indicate.
For example, the most notable was in the case of sweet lemonade, as children began to give preference to drinking water.
Children most often checked the questionnaire for white meat and fish as a main dish and would reduce sweet and "knedliky" dishes (Czech speciality of bread meal or potato pellets).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry that there were a lot of them from the beginning.
I wasn't thinking about what was going to happen later.
Presentations by three professionals in the specialty, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on the spot.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we approach the final exams, the more we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays, it's really "shunted".
This time we have with Director Alenka (in the course there are no boys) treated the way to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women of this kind are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without a particular curve, another of the overweight.
The stylist should know how to optically ampenate wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We thus managed to emphasize the character nicely and also not to dress too conspicuously types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a fine waist.
For example, if there is a difference between waist and hips in such a way that skirts or pants don't pass at all, it's worth it to be tailored.
And you won't regret it because the clothes that go down flawlessly are priceless.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in the one that glides constantly, wraps around and does not hold to the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford Tucker style clothing, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or even embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of different appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort out all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that with regard to what I have to do at home there are too many.
Each intern received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into consideration the current appearance, the type of fashion of the personality and its appearance.
I'll have to "dress up"Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know about the Victoria Secret campaign.
In my heart, it makes me happy, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost a hundred pounds lately (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work the graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Reflecting also on the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress physics in this way but creates for example productive pages in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, spoke to us about all this.
But this... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general view
Three guests from the specialty gave a diverse aspect to Saturday's session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with a single garment in a different way.
Variability is for this prime example.
Like for example this trench-coat that must be worn in a classic way with jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with escarpins and take it as a picture as a dress.
Or simply pull up the sleeves or collar and immediately have a new look.
"Play with that," he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly".
"You can then start contravening it," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, what to do, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to the Ben fashion photographer that the stylist must have a lot more variants of clothing than those photographed.
That is to say that for fashion story that will have about ten pages (so a dozen models) I have to be ready to "retail" at least fifteen pages.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We need to count on this when creating a model.
The fact that image and style sometimes make half of the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just watch Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylists' services remains fragile.
And the known faces sometimes consider them useless (it is enough that I know something but what I appear goes to second place).
And if someone gets a styling on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that it dictates to us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than the one it actually has.
Then we only have to navigate on google and make sure that the boulevard information mentions the celebrity in question, whether it has lost weight or fat etc...
Honza and Mario laid us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he dresses and it is thus important to be a good psychologist.
Know how to guess people, not flatter themselves, keep his opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort out her wardrobe and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything away and tell her, God, what a horror."
"You will find some things that you will find pretty and he you will advise with what to wear them with," says Mario.
This one has shown us concretely what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
It's the one you hang around the waist and have on you for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, rolls for depilation or nurse pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which a garment is closed in the back, if it is too large (pin or other type of staple are not usable because they could damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
So that we were not just people who listened but tried something in a practical way, they taught us how to braid shoes properly.
And during the photo shoot in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could damage itself, fortiori outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We didn't have the right to touch the scissors so we wouldn't inadvertently hurt ourselves.
So we really need skills.
Mario pleased me when he congratulated me on my creation.
The count I'm reporting isn't for my girlfriend.
This is only a brief summary of what we learned during the second weekend of the course.
I am increasingly beginning to understand that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what they want.
The need for speed The Run fights all over America.
Revision
Initially a problem-free race is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift at work.
It fills everyone's ambition to a certain extent, but it is useless if no one wants to do something more.
The new subtitled part The Run produced high expectations before it was released.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed race series and to release a kind of game from playable games that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how the added passages will be in which the main hero comes out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what one attended.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the set pulls down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of incomprehensible idleness on the part of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught in the adventure whose main hero Jack has caracterial problems and to solve them begins to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then in more than 50 races.
The result is that each race is done on another route and the stages planned in different environments that are quite different from each other and are interesting.
The player does not feel for a moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are pretty supercroit even if the graphic technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
Well, that's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snow-capped mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are in addition to time with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that reduces your visibility significantly.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Besides that, the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There are only a few, but that is enough.
There are moments you try to exceed the requested number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the clock (classical duel with the chronometer) and then wait for another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who are entering the game and trying to make the situation dificient.
The novelty is the off-vehicle passages.
It's more like an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away in front of someone and you have to help him by typing on the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is good as this is because this element is not likely to interfere and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that enhance the game.
The driving pattern is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that at present there is nothing extraordinary but it cannot be said that it is negative.
As far as realistic simulation is concerned, you will have to look elsewhere.
But although one can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
At the diffference of the driving model, that of collisions is not yet to the point.
We don't expect this game to be complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don't have, in a collision with any object, any idea of how your car behaves, so it's not completely good.
During tight exceedances you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car leaves in crazy voltiges.
Or you'll find yourself in crumbs.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really bothers you.
The restart is done so that when you broke your face or you came out in the decor the game brings you back to the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you have to start the game again from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool, in case something doesn't go right, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes restarts do not help and it is necessary to find the solution by remembering from memory the piece of route in question.
The great thing about this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are certain turns that need to be passed in a certain way, otherwise it does not pass.
Otherwise you meet on a given location "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or one minute late.
What makes you angry are situations when you see the opponent pass easily between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you must either stand aside and converse or brake them.
It doesn't matter if you go in front of him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always happens very close to your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about the time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This upsets the most at the end of the game when you ride on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must at all costs pass in front of you.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collid a good number of times.
It can be understood that the goal of this game is to do something captivating and full of adredaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And that's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that's going on.
And it is equal if it is because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is to change the car during the races.
You need to pay attention to the gas pumps on the routes because you can change car however most of the time you have enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, big American cars for straight motorways and super sports cars with exotic sights on very technical pipelines for example on yaw roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know of adventure, goes very well with the main diet of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
This one connects on-line with the Autolog function, which inter alia compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult blows to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks).
Your speedometer tells you between 150 and 200 km/hour (presumably) and behind you arrives a metro train that sends you the car directly to the scrap.
In writing we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought about creating this game or whether the authors really think of us as fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What is bothering is that in more extreme situations, imaging does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This applies especially to accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imaging is no longer useful to you.
The sound part is good and the track is of choice.
In order to please as many as possible and especially the young audience a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General Impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confused.
If the game did not have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game makes it feel like it's not over.
Fun is really good, but prepare yourself for mistakes to hit you in the eye with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.
Velvet students in concert with the choirs of Charles University
The Festa Academica festival offers for the third time festivities that link International Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical part.
During the festival there are 20 choirs from the higher schools and secondary classes.
The highlight of the festival is two concerts orchestrated on November 17.
"Charles University has an important part in this festival."
"Among the choirs there is the Choir of the Faculty of Pedagogy and Humanities, in the committee of the festival seat the Rector Vaclav Hampl", says the leader of the organizing team Jakub Calou.
The highlight of the festival is the concert of the Choir des lycées et classes secondaires which takes place with free admission on November 17 from 14 hours on the space located in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
On the program there is the composition of the well-known Czech jazzman Karel Ruzicka, Celebration Jazz mass.
In the evening the concert "Student Velvet" takes place in the premises of the National House in Vinohrady during which the choirs of the higher schools and that of the University Charles perform.
The Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate with dignity the International Student Day and to recall the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present to the public a choir music of the highest level and to develop the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organiser is the Union of Czech Cheers in cooperation with Jan Kepler High School.
All the action is under the aegis of Bohuslav Svoboda, Mayor of Prague and Vaclav Hampl, Rector of Charles University.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically eliminated the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect such a hard war."
"This will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role", Milena Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law the Czech Ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the various EU bodies and their relations in such a understandable and visible way that a large number of lecturers from the Faculty of Law at Charles University could envy her, she showed how seriously she takes her wordo "understandable and openly about Europe".
Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the critics echoed that he was bland, that he was a cook-round, that he could not fill any mission, and I must say that he took the breath out of everyone because he held his role to perfection."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe".
She explained the new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is in the European Union?" "What telephone number should I call?", so as an important step towards the unity and greater legibility of the Union's policy vis-à-vis the states, as is China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our syrecky (cooked cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that the European Council has lived, lived and will live in a short time.
She called the Czech Presidency two years ago a success.
The Czechs resolved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or organised a summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She described the fall of the gouvernement as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of Mrs L'Ambassadrice, "the activity has beaten its full strength" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve itself now.
There is also a need to approve the new Union septemal budget, which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it seems that the budget will be thin and for savings, which branch will have priority, which countries will be most, at least, helped, everything is to be resolved in future negotiations.
Madam Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted pickles, bananas of different size or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky".
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador the Czechs have the reputation of being eurosceptics and people who only see things in their negative aspect more than positively.
Moreover, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
According to her, the fault results from several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Pole, the Magyar, the Slovak, the Frenchman comes to me, he says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this Visegrad group still doing?' and he's not happy at all."
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future, the Member States are waiting for tough new rules on fiscal policy.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not a multi-speed Europe, that prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute for Enhanced Cooperation".
First of all, it was said that cooperation between the countries that want it and those that do not want it remains in their corner."
"There will be many such institutes and there will be a truly two-speed Europe," Vicenova says.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to establish the basis for discussing all issues affecting the EU between all EU members and not just the same as the Eurozone.
History of a brand:
IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to look for the word that expresses the IBM strategy as closely as possible, the closest would be "the long term".
For a broad audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The basis for this long-term strategy was laid by the firm's first head, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left the slogan that many of the world's problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE'!" became the imprint around which the life of a giant future will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
This was the basis of Watson's carefully crafted company culture.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years because it always remained true to its core values and yet was not afraid to change all the others around it.
This has enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more "delamented for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to look after his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM's people were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid vacations, insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and commmercials.
In the same way IBM has a system of well-developed customer relations.
The company was at first brilliant in the discovery of talents - as one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and could thus have the choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman- Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has been with IBM for 30 years and currently holds the position of Chief Sales, Marketing and Strategy Officer.
IBM in recent years has done what is called jamy, brain-storming online from which come many future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that assures it a secure position in the field of business.
"Since the beginning IBM had a concept rather of an institution than a technology firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve problems in the business world using its technology," added Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Grande Bleue", as it is commonly called in the United States with regard to its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown up to become one of the world's largest firms.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the level of the server's products up to nanotechnology.
She has many patents from all American technology firms and five of her employees have received a Nobel Prize.
His discoveries include, for example, the ATM, the payment card, the financial swap, the barcode or the diskette.
IBM ended up this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it dislodged in 1996 Microsoft.
Preview in advance
Not all innovations and manufactures were preferred by the customer and at the time - IBM, for example, did not succeed in the bet on a specific OS/2 operating system, the Prodige service online or the IBM PCjr computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the advance movement you can't emotionally stick to the past," points out Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, Microsoft concurent that at the base stands and remains under Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a prominent place.
However still in 1990 she was with more of the participation motley the strongest representative of hardware.
Starting in 2000 IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, during this period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it surpassed the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the major economic crisis also increased its investment volume.
It now appears that IBM passes the current crisis without being worried?
The price of the IBM share has progested from 2008 on rocket by 120 percent, the firm's net profit continues to grow.
IBM's logo is to change everything but not its values.
This can be expected to lead this flexible giant to other crises.
IBM story: From cheese slices to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago and originally had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It was named IBM in 1924 - originally a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 1980s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as old "pointers", pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 chaired the Supervisory Board of the company.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then shattered the founder of the firm - Watson's ideas have been the foundation of society's identity and culture to date.
Watson ran the Kusqu firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, revenue increased to $9 million and began the firm's expansion in all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable to the firm that after 40 years of management, his son occupied the director's chair, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM's people and computers helped NASA guide flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company from Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded in IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and city management.
As for the field of trade IBM has recently developed a platform "Smarter Commerce" which helps the trades to manage the whole business cycle.
IBM has a strong history also in our territory.
She founded her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also Brno's Strategic Outsourcing Center.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the world-wide research and development team that is responsible for speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova gave shelter in the summer to Bartosova in her house, she had no idea that her couple would not stay.
When Iveta insisted on moving from Ricany after 30 days, Pepa did not push the singer back.
And he confessed in public that he loved her.
In time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's affair and ended up saying goodbye forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome him on the doorstep of the house.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my old ass loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship", let Rychtarova filter by showing that she has separated herself from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door to him is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and not change."
"My wife set up a wedding on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we talk completely normal but we don't sleep together," said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop it.
"We don't sleep together and I'm not interested in where she's going, with whom and if she's having an affair.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all responsibility for myself," concluded Joseph.
The worst vices of women: Does this concern you too?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all of them, both of them, are able to pull them out of their sleeves.
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines female vices that manage to pump the blood of men's veins.
Procurement
Your half makes you remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one garment a week?
Are you happy to buy and package at the time of sale?
In your case, we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you will say, which one would resist the window wicking of clothing shops, to look for for yourself pretty clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, this can become for man a real hell.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse that he's waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat"?
"I need to lose weight at least 5 kilos - should I start playing sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Don't these phrases remind you of anything?
Yes?
So you're one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop caring for yourself, but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about its appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more frequent these complaints increase and the more women become poisonous.
Odre and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite ride.
Wash windows, vacuum, clean floors, dust, strip the bathroom - twice a week.
You make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they dirty the sink, smashed the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer precisely from this obsession, try to bear in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be the first place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness, however, can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sape
"Put this worn-out sweatsuit in the trash."
"You're going to put those old socks on tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor."
If you do this sap job on your partner this way several times a day, you're really going to break it down.
It's obvious that you don't think wrongly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much sap work...
Defamation, persifting
Defamation, persiflage, but also insults against someone are also the own of some women.
Women are particularly involved in relationships and are happy to treat subjects as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each one of us lets out a little harmless persiflage here and there.
The hand on the heart is yet a peculiarity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persecute, even despise others and are for their surroundings - especially at work in a group of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped with their participation in the Philadelphia victory
Hokeyist forward Jagr has twice participated in Philadelphia's win during Monday's NHL game on Caroline's ice and is back in the lead of the productive Czech players for the contest.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made one more pass and was named the best player in the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who played with Jagr, also scored two goals during the game.
Jagr after the match told the journalists from overseas that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," Jagr explained after his action Giroux scored a goal of the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second assault on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes for the blade and presented it to the Maxime Talbot scorer.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, and Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the top three," Jagr said about his center.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of my career with a hokeyjist like him."
"I'm really happy with that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at the NHL the other players in the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," added Jagr.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she ends up with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that ended at two to one.
"Pronger has made excellent attacks in our area."
"He hit the blade, I got speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the last goal of the game from his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia came with this victory at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo, he went out in the second third due to an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candians did not stand against an experienced defender their two-goal lead and lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
It was the fact that the backline was sick that especially bothered the local trainer rather than lost punches because they played the game only with 5 defenders.
"It sucks."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young people."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," says Martin.
"Replacement on replacement was not enough and we couldn't resist".
"We just had to simplify the game, push the blade out of our zone."
For this we had limits," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender, took part in the thirtieth attack in Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax goals of the Jets, who stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time proposed trips mainly to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists travelled for holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have an inclination for the west and trips to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
In case the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example in Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the west, however it was necessary to queue all night with a sleeping bag or to have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The currency agreement that was the condition to travel to the west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs spent most of their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and cottages that the Czechs were buying and this habit continues until now.
The Czechs' journeys have since 1989 experienced a major revolution.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were to the maximum, the Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million days of holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s of the last century in the neighbouring countries of the west has led to a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for a long time travel by plane to the west, which everyone wanted to see for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris the travel organizations made the Czechs sleep in tents in the parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical trait of a Czech trip was at that time to carry with you his own preserved food, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown, which finally allowed our tourists after decades to be able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wage have increased which has led to another important moment around 1997.
With increasing demand for travel travel travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare tours with air charter routes which thanks to contracts have dramatically reduced costs compared to what was before.
By the end of the 90s of the last century the Czechs had visa-free connections with almost most developed countries around the world except the EU which later facilitated our journeys.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when was prepared the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutional development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008 the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully join the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time again in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person on holidays abroad including ancillary charges. Crowns per person.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this may end with a situation without a solution "a pat"
Almost 5 months already Czech football is without President and he risks that Ivan Hasek's successor to the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after another General Assembly to be held on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement as to which voting rules should be followed.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the Czech football management.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek football has gone back towards differences between the chambers of the Association which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely demonstrated on 16 September when a new president was to be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained blocked and there was no even talk of how to deal with the election.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly — only, it seemed, statutory representatives or officials with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since that moment with the assistance also of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
There are still differences about the rules for the election.
It is too clear that the executive committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not brought anything to the situation either.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the critical point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the pat.
"The point of discord is either to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model", one of the three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football within the association.
In the third round, according to the rules of the proposed model, candidates receive the highest percentage of votes in the chamber for which they are candidates.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to withdraw so that the candidate who received the highest percentage of votes from both chambers wins.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only this would result in the loss of the idea of two previous rounds and would completely reject the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the Moravian party and who would best not change the rules and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees, even if he believes that the election rules established according to the statutes the most Pelta advantage among all candidates.
"I would like to have the maximum vote in accordance with the statutes of the association."
"In order to ensure that there are not yet any wild ideas imagined by a representative as in the past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations was defined mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The qualification available today in the European Championship should calm everyone down."
" Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation," adds the Jablonec officer, who among the three has the greatest experience in the field of football management, both professional and regional.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the drawing regulations".
"This can cause the General Assembly to freeze again."
"I still hope that the healthy reason will win," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but that can tell whether the whole football leadership will be complete for the game.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorice, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was being sought to take part of the Executive Committee to the field of reprisals.
In the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the torn parts of the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union of Sports which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to the battle for the post of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If Plzen Tomas Paclik's head of football had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asked for for a new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT), he would not be campaigned for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not run for office."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CRK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try precisely to prevent Pelta from getting to the head of the AFRT which would a priori be given favorite for this election.
Paclik also points out that, in the event that he wins the elections, he would only hold the post of President until 2013 when he is scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would see in the position an experienced and high-level manager who is not connected with the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he says.
"For me it was terrible when some told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change this image," he added.
What is said to be particularly bothering Paclik is the relationship between Pelta and the President of Plzen Roman Berbr's Regional Football Union, a man with a counter-versed reputation who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates 'the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable for Pelta to occupy this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying merchant, it would be even less favorable to football," Paclik said.
What still shocks him is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago in the course of listening to an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta managed without any pain.
"I don't know what Pelta prestige would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell Plzen's club".
In the event that Paclik wins the vote on Thursday, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik prior to the September General Assembly that had ended with a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first with whom I would go."
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able to present himself as, for example, head of the representation."
"But as manager of the Association he wouldn't be able."
"I don't put my nose into what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September drew great attention when he spoke out for the annulment of the Board of Arbitrators with Ludek Macela that replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik states that he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his abilities to run private firms and that he also runs the Plzen club since last year which celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it."
"I would slow down the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," added Paclik, who does not cast out his antipathy for the leader of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonising relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose power to lobby high-level policies would make it possible to obtain more money for sport from taxes on games.
"This is one of the key points that the new President should be dealing with."
"If this is the gambling tax as the political parties say, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current relationship with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the AFRT president should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla from Prague.
"It's not ideal."
I see no reason to pass on my actions from the Plzen club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later," said Paclik.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that should put an end to pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidates for the Presidency Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end in the future to the quarrels about the rules for elections.
Jablonec's official is before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and thinks that the success of the football performance today should calm down this war before the vote.
Pelta before the election in September that did not happen promised to devote himself precisely to national representation and to obtaining financial means if he is elected.
He had decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly had passed, and that delay of two months might well enable him to defend his vision of football leadership and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a president on Thursday."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the leadership of the Association," he adds, but he is primarily connected with the Jablonec club, has worked for many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
This is also why he has enough experience to run Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the General Assembly of June the statutes were approved which were not perfect as all found out".
"If there were not all these various interpretations we would have already had a President since September," Pelta said.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that has taken all the attention of the delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and am prepared to take all the responsibilities in case it doesn't work."
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist," Pelta added.
Then he tried, it was said, not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes with regard to his legal training and that he knows fully that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He hasn't attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time either, but he doesn't stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's been playing football for a year and has already had some success."
"His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"This is also why some now have doubts about his character," said Pelta to his opponent, but remains faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to the national representation.
It should be a football vitirne.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that start with the Bohemian one or the continuation of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," the 46th candidate said to the Czech Press Agency TKC two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not lead to any change of people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he said in Strahov, where there has been understandable nervousness since there was no direction.
Although there were planned catastrophic scenarios with the General Assembly, he believed that delegates would not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is only one discord on how to vote in the third round we will succeed."
"Focation needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader at its head", as Pelta optimistically states two days before the day probably decisive for his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his direction the AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the General Assembly on Thursday it would not please many people," he said.
Rajchl promises, however, that in case he is elected we will start working hard.
He wanted systemic changes and made the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various fields of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian affair, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President I want to take care of football as a whole."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and high-performance football for youth."
"But I'm not saying I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for TKC.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member will take care of a specific field."
"And I will distribute difficult missions so that football faces a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
It was said that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know whether it's worth it and whether I'll have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and raise doubts about each of my actions," explains why he was hesitant.
"Many people have told me, however, that I must not give up because they would give up too."
"It's a trust I can't betray," he says.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work begun with Hasek.
"Since the last two years there has been a great work of fact and I don't want to let him down."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said with fear that in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and this is something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"Behind him are people who made football in such a way that it would only be for those who were chosen."
"I can be blamed for a number of things, but surely not bear any of them."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to play football for all because everyone will be happy with it not only those who have been chosen
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are those who say otherwise, I am ready to do as much as I can for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, the winners of which would end up in the first division."
"There would be no situation like currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the post of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I always feel a support from the Czech Chamber which elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successes," said Rajchl who plans among his future successes to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, contracts negotiations with televisions and on the law on games.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has enough to offer football.
"No one can doubt Plzen that he has done a great job this year."
"If he were elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make any noticeable change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to spoil his successes," said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
By Julia Stanek
Oven optic paddling pools, beautiful pools of Budapest: Who travels across Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can let rest his tired legs in gas baths.
A book shows which swimming pool you can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missed in his luggage: his swimsuit.
Stretched on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged domes, and swam against the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If a covered swimming pool pleases her, she would write in her notebook without delay all the details worthy of interest on the type of construction and on the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she presented them in her book already published: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain". Münich's municipal covered swimming pools, historic bath palaces in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She has taken her "travels to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true fan of bathing culture.
Meder, explains that she does not have much interest in sport but she feels attracted to water in a totally different way.
It's irritating that swim supporters should be content to contemplate blue tiles and accommodate the stench of bleach while joggers breathe in the scent bewitching spruce forests or can listen to the joyous jogging of birds in the park.
"I wondered one day why pools should actually always be so ugly," said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
A dive in a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - a factor of well-being in swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders would have given themselves a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real delight to the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is on one side transparent, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multicoloured tiles, springboards.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes a 190-page report worthy of interest on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to make a jump in the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
In addition to the splendid well-being baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found nitrate-containing water in a natural cave in the karst (crop bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths filled with water containing alcali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászbereny) in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the open-air heated swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While a roof of Zürich's bath has the whole city in its eyes, one can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which one can observe the animation on the ski track.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background rise the mountains of the Ötztal towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of bleach does not come from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulphur, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which it is hard to believe, to be in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its silt sticks to your skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for the beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder was also disappointed: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded terrain.
The bath designed by Archtec Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed.
By looking through the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the flowering of weeds between the tiles.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad thermal palace.
This building has already survived three phases; we can discover not only neo-Roman elements that have emerged since its conception in 1844 but also a Moorish room in Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite bath of the pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it is originally from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a great performance to melt so different construction styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, diving into the thermal pool is apparently only a minor question.
Agricultural specification
The German bank examines in detail the speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation on raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann set up a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the group leader then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the point is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as maize and wheat.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this business opportunity because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the speculation of the stock exchanges on global raw materials, pushes prices up and that the banks share complicity in the global famine.
The consumer protection campaign is in concrete action against Deutsche Bank leader Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Raw material speculation was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts in the meantime share the view that wagers have separated themselves from offers and demand - and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently from American competitors: He promised to investigate the reproaches and said, "no case is worth putting in play the Deutsche Bank's good reputation".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The examination must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank's board of directors must be presented - usually with recommendation.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could lead to a reduction in the raw material market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his Image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The speculation on the rise in food prices shows in a particularly draconian way, to what extent the banks of today are harming the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculation," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's about hungry people or whether Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
The awareness of Ackermann may seem surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wishes to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving his office.
Deutsche Bank has announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything that is expected in the Board of Directors.
He could improve his brand image by abandoning controversial agricultural speculations.
And with regard to possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will care about it.
One in two would terminate investments in raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday survey, with which on 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires among 1001 people.
Just eleven percent have found this legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many of the bank's clients would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: one in two would, following the survey, terminate all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
Forty-three per cent would not recommend such a bank to their entourage, 49% replied that they would think about cancelling their account to change their banking establishment.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion That Moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups, downs and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin.
Now it is open again and acts as an exhibition house.
If you are enthusiastic about a modern post-war architecture, its clear shapes, its glass hangars, its lively and bold looks and its new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the Universal Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its steel and glass construction, light and suspended.
Construction is regarded until today as an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house and its adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its project of pavilion as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the station of the South of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it was used for so long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and has become more and more unladen.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name "Maison du 21ème siècle" and will in future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Belvedere Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck from any point of view.
The new start was completed by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in her youth as an art skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, she carried out particularly the transformation work with politicians and the protection of monuments, she obtained public funds and private sponsorship and established its exploitation.
Except for contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a café and a bookshop are there, and an office has to be built there.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and sensibly expanded Joseph Ombracht's secession and had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of its move to Vienna and its change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: the building was "an energy abyss," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, glass fibre reinforced insulation glass was laid and the roof replaced by a particular safety glass.
The beams of the thermal bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a light panel sifted between the house and the road provides the lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but always the light Pavillon Schwanzer.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in a rust protection shade of red-brown color.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and cheap had to be found, and which also please the Office of Protection Monuments," said Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a lucky shot of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands precisely the "neighborhood of the central station" newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another chance will perhaps happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as he says, she is already negotiating with the city in order to get a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees is expected to double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million more this year.
The daily newspaper "Bild"-Zeitung has previously reported by invoking an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the case of extreme weather conditions.
The number of internal and external employees for the snow removal of railway installations and docks is expected to double to 16,000.
The objective is to clear the wharves of snow and ice until the start of the service phase and 90 per cent of the track equipment required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago the station chief Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a summit conference of train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a great deal of problems with the transport of users, because it lacks, among other things, reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been awaiting authorization from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had enough to do for years, since it has to have the axles of the ICE trains checked significantly more often at the workshop, after an axle break took place on an ICE at the central station in Cologne.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the USA.
After the affair of Chief Josef Ackermann there is something new in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not already sufficient, the past of this giant in the sector catches up with him in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison with 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator is charging large banks with a whole series of charges that have prompted cooperative banks to make false promises about buying financial products; they would have minimized risks.
These documents lost a great deal of value during the financial crisis and led the banks down.
"We are satisfied that we have been able to find a solution to this issue, without the parties initiating proceedings in the court," said a point of contact with Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank has not recognized any faults in comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
The President of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for cooperative banks in the USA and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to repair the damage of several billions of dollars.
The comparisons made now are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took part in other large banks and in summer he appealed to the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the question of mortgage documents, it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. housing bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the summit of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though events are already a few years old, at present there is a stormy wind on American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have brought numerous remedies to seek redress or to punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) triggered the largest wave of complaints.
She blames 18 major international banks, the two US state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for having benefited in kind in mortgage transactions of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with FHFA, which is a number of transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities request that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without mentioning a specific sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the applications as unjustified and stated that it wished to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, invests huge sums in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has purchased more than $10 billion in shares.
Until then, the big American investor Warren Buffett constantly explains that he does not invest in IT IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies shows only bad predictions.
However, he read IBM's reports and changed his opinion on investments in this sector.
He had already had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and IT systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight's attack in the world of finance.
As a result, the IBM IT business gives itself the right to now call itself " IBM Mister".
Because Buffett revealed today to the CNBC economic issue that he has bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway thus became a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM never knew anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated management, who even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable benefits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been relying for some time on IT lucrative services as the operation of accounting centres.
The IT pioneer, more than 100 years old, offers both Software and consulting as well as high-performance business calculators.
Buffett had so far avoided technology companies.
He says he's only investing in businesses he understands about.
But on the contrary, Buffett instead attacks rail freight, lubricants or machinery manufacturers.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares in a range of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Rück Munichois.
This 81-year-old had taken over the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company in the 1960s and had established it as one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to intelligent investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That's why he's a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible meaning to earn money earned him the nickname "Omaha's Oracle".
After the announcement of Buffett's investment IBM shares increased by one percent on the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", as also known as IBM, has a total market value of over $220 billion and is one of the world's most valuable technology companies with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, says Buffett, he doesn't want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would be reborn now.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist background.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
For for many German-Turkish people, the spectre that had long been believed to be dead has reappeared: since the incendiary attacks of Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable to this extreme right-wing context against the Turks.
That there is xenophobia in Germany, however, has never been mentioned.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose size is far from foreseeable.
"Is this a return to the bloody ideology", "This was the title of the internet publication of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, points out that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities might be involved in the far-right quagmire.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted in a reasoned manner: this weekend it called for a silent commemoration of victims of racial violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish policies had thought of a ceremony on the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media make the effect of a slap: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Thus, the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not fail to draw univocal conditions from it.
"It's starting to stink," this is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He pointed out that people had been murdered, paid taxes and made a significant contribution through their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
The action of the police was perceived in a very critical way on the German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why it has not already come much earlier to the mind of the German authorities to carry out research in certain suspect extreme right-wing circles, the authors are surprised.
More than one is at least ready for rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be sloppy, migrants will have nothing but self-defense and armament".
"it will be the best self-defense."
"Inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the whole network," writes Selen.
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s explained well.
The photograph of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which mistrust and distance through acts of violence could lead.
The attacks have, however, sharpened the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat mistakes of the past
In the past it was above all the failure of German politics after the attacks of which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in his speech at the time, how many taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As if a man's value could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the distrust of many German-Turkish people has been towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to the efforts to clarify and re-evaluate extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
Zürich Lake Scandal Bank
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost gone bankrupt in the financial crisis and is in the meantime patina from one crisis to another.
He's a German who has to run now.
That's certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it became known in July that he would occupy an almost as spectacular post in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss large bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly welcomed, praised; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently achieved solidity and made some kind comments on future colleagues.
"UBS made it to Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, as early as September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all of the Bank's security systems and had flaming around 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
of the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has since been regarded as suffering - and all ask: When does Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency of the administration already in May - not in 2013, as the bank said on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
At once he took responsibility for a bank's strategy, which had just proved once again that it had long deserved the title of "the biggest scandal bank in Europe".
Indeed, the UBS is on one side enormous - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been skating for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, spares the proud Swiss bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also cunning, had combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So the UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from an easy customer base than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
It made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later bank professor for many years in Zurich says: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank in front of my students."
"In the current perspective, one wonders: how could I just have been so wrong?"
He was deeply wrong.
In 2007 it became apparent that for the first time something was wrong with the UBS.
In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli withdrew in a surprising way, which until then was regarded as a high intellectual as well as a great banker.
A few months later, we came across the reasons why he had left.
The division of the bank had flaming with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross on billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this she did find investors, but who, shortly before, would have frowned: a non-transparent Asian state background from Singapore and an Arab state background, which was ignored, to the point that one never even learned his name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank was to announce again losses amounting to billions, the chairman of the board Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second highest paid board of directors in Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was, in view of its investment errors, in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country, to shelter such large banks.
Finally, the 2007 UBS balance sheet total was more than five times Switzerland's economic performance (see graph).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, he followed the second one.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated due to a tax dispute with America and expressed its readiness to publish the data of the wealthy clientele, who had broken the tax perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in return for unjustified profits arising from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus the UBS has more or less published that it had helped with tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal the Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
In a few months the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: banking investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to aid for tax evasion.
And, as there was a bit of a calm return, and as we thought, that the UBS would come out of it, it followed this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single title merchant flaming 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was not going around.
And it's published: with risk management in investment banks it still doesn't seem to work.
"With the Adoboli case, we have seen that the mastery of risks has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the University of Zurich's Banking Institute.
Also the chief financial officer of a large German bank is sure: "the problem of UBS is that it does not have control of the risks in hand."
However, it was precisely the idea of prudence, with which Swiss bankers had long taken up their duties, that of becoming guardians of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakeable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS power plant in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the solid cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank has its headquarters at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are here prestigious, the rents of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers like Tiffany's, we find them here between shops of Swiss traditions as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank to the Swiss Credit Palace to elitist private banks like Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered in marble, in front there are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day left the market - or betrayed the two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business with the two big banks as well.
The UBS would have become far too large, he said - especially in banking investment, where Anglo-Saxons had also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing left to say.
"And yet, they have long adapted to the morals of Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution lost so much money in the jungle of sub-prime like the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of the seven million inhabitants undertook the biggest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of the UBS".
With around 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If we talk with Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks jointly concluded a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for the small Swiss – and has been constantly growing.
What helped was that the two different UBS predestined banks completed: a rich but lethargy bank with a strong focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer one, but certainly already more strongly internationalised.
All of a sudden, the international investment banks had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who gets along very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who made a way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted to the end in Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: exuberance arrived before the fall.
UBS staff clearly remember the leaders' meetings at which the leader of the Wuffli group always gave the same slogan: dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She commissioned the "League Tables" the rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to go up there.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In terms of currency and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
However, corporate advisors, who were responsible, pointed out a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the "Fixed Income" banking jargon, there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost its life.
Assaulted by growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the US sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has turned into a massive machine that has packaged and passed value documents based on US mortgages - but has also kept risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to get off.
"In the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there," said Geiger, the banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the sharper the fall.
One manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts proved to be more difficult than we thought.
Posts at UBS have become ejectable and so far are banked.
Whoever runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He has to find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger already has an idea: put an end to the investment bank, concentration on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment bank has to atrophy vigorously, as far as is clear so far.
Next Thursday bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has established himself: he must conduct the affairs of the UBS on a sustainable basis, the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress of the mid-1990s.
He's canceling 3500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He says publicly so far only that he was going to look with his wife for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.

Smart crows spread in cities
In many places, froths are considered a "bird problem" but experts say that these very intelligent animals are no longer being hunted by cities for a long time.
Some like them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The crows have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of the residents multiply because of the dirt and the noise of the animals.
An antidote against the "no bird problem" is not yet in sight.
During the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts said that it is no longer possible to chase the frizz out of cities.
Experts from all over Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in cities
The protectors of nature based the problems of cities also on the exodus of particularly protected friezes: The use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional vital spaces.
The hunting, development and slaughter of typical hatching trees made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 brood pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project won negative publicity because of the crow massacre in this region.
Critics found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal gourdins.
"The normal expulsion, the eviction, is useless," said Leer's city and landscape planner, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests using pressure water or cutting down trees often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals move away, the large colonies divide and they disperse to other places."
Evence can only be imagined in exceptional cases, such as in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We find ourselves obliged to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem is not solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to Mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Concevable is a combination of the gutting of animals to aversive packaging and catchy offers, to allow them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens explored "info panels instead of chainsaws" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better support a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Schleswig-Holstein Wastebasket Training and Training, road signs informing about the lives of these very intelligent fries.
In the meantime, this project has been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about criticism of the noise caused by birds: "There is a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say".
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: The friezes not only use working instruments to achieve a treat but they themselves manufacture their tools as working instruments.
Ethologists at Cambridge University were testing four fries recently, to what extent the intelligence of the birds is coming.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to collapse a scaffold with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to make the platform collapse.
In a second attempt, the cunning crows had to solve a more crowded problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
Birds could not reach their loot with their beaks.
However, the researchers had put pieces of wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the little pipe.
Three of the four fries are successful even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosniacs and Turks for a coup remained unsuccessful.
Favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will take part in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the playoffs at the 2012 European Championship in Poland and suddenly eliminated Ukraine.
Driven by the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal made a mistake against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after the 0:0 of the match, its fifth participation in the European championship.
The Czechs reached the game back playoff by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0), had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was also hotter in the 0:0 draw between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) break against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with a hand-played 11-metre penalty (41') and Captain Emir Spahic (65') made twice a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red map (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free kick 30 meters in advance into the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his remote shooting qualities and fired at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half hour did nothing, had their first clear chance thanks to attacker Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger, the leader of the English championship in Manchester City initiated a headball directed to the bottom of the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek pulled a goal for the Czech
Finally referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the center of all attentions.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnia penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36’).
On the opposite side, Stark awarded a penalty of 11 meters played by the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But after the break, the 2004 European vice-champion managed four shots and everything became clear.
For the Czech, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for a fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), was also lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Keeper of the goal Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored at the 40th minute of rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the rescue of the world-class keeper of the Czechs already shot, again, the attacker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50').
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey was missing Zagreb's football miracle during this time.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the 2002 EM third-party bench, the Croats were able to rejoice in their fourth lap in the final of the European championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia gained more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
Besides Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, which was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund in the 62nd Minute, the legionnaires of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish have been celebrating their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken charge with a success of 4:0 the first stage for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) has equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed up speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy received the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment that the defence of Estonia was able to prevent a possible goal of the -first scorer.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense of goaltender Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and tied the ball on the line for 1:0.

Personal mass slaughter
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. Titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War", it begins with a long list of characters that holds your heart together.
A tip to start with: carefully tear this page and make it your page mark.
You will get to know these people in detail. In this romantic narrative by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mists of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who delivers the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here an unusual book that he accurately describes as "an anti-history book."
It has some well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; almost no ambassador or discussion of strategies and materials is found.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it could look like." It includes "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and grief" summarizes the experiences in wartime of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, paramedics and vendors.
Some will become heroes.
Others of the prisoners of war, some of them will lose limbs, go crazy or lose their lives.
Their lives wander here like the candles of a church: while some of them turn off, new ones are turned on again.
Peter Englund's book departs from traditional history books.
He refuted the idea that World War I was summed up only by the terrible trench war on the western front.
"Beauty and grief" cleverly describes other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; one passes Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that stinks of the cordite.
When gunshots sound in the distance, and you are a mother at home, do you stay or flee?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been compounded by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and grief" follows such individuals as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most address deprivation and the ability to cope.
By telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on alternative food in Germany.
He describes "meat made of cooked rice crushed in sheep's fat (and finished with a fake wood bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles."
He states that "837 authorised substitute meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories address honour and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive towards savagery and says about the war: "You feel that after all, that's what men were meant to do, rather than sit in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky by hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather than pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbaric behind your shirt stuffed and studded.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is at great risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to him.
"When we are resigned to sacrifice ourselves, we hope to have an audience," he writes.
Unfortunately, it's quite similar to "a convicted man strangled in secret."
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming increasingly a history of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He grasps the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the well articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothing, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; we find as many basic behaviors as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who tried at all costs to catch venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread over the genitals in the hope of ending up in hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into a blindness for life."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasps the way in which the war has "triggered forces exclusively uncontrollable: an extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are waging a war.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "To the West nothing new", by Erich Maria Remark, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he had come up from his book, seized with your hands that page where the list of people appears and burned with a match.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be most empty.
The operation remained secret to all except for some high-ranking officers as well as others informed from the outset that they were going to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the police department.
There could be no repetition of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, who went against the department's regulation and caused a storm of public solidarity for the demonstrators.
The operation to clean up the Zuccotti Park of its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the course of occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on the island of Randall, in preparation for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots - anti-terrorist measures that involve rapidly moving a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was held on Monday night, on the side of Manhattan East River.
The orders given to move in the park came "at the last minute", said a regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few policemen I know and who were called did not know that they would go to Zuccotti Park," said the person anonymously.
"The only ones who know that they would go there are at the top of the hierarchy of the police department."
The city learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, police officers wanted to clean up the park but were pushed back by hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the neighbourhood - dozens of officers used to particularly criminal neighbourhoods.
Kelly said that many people went and came to the park during the day, like migrants, so one hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages of loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.
While community affairs officers were entering the park with their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left.
No tents were hit before 1:45 a.m. said the police, which gave the occupants time to collect their belongings.
Other police teams were sighted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the head of the police department, stated that this action had been taken solely by security.
But according to many journalists, the police reportedly prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, which was severely held by the officers.
Mr. Browne stated that the television camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved westward through the heavy business of the demonstrators, including luggage, plastic grass and bags of sheets filled with clothing, teams from the sanitation department followed, cleaning everything that the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged. The images were posted on the Internet shortly thereafter.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the park centre.
Some formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
About ten people at the epicentre of the camp clinged together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services were called to cut the locks.
No arrests took place in the park until 3:30 a.m. said Mr. Kelly.
According to the police, the clean-up operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
most of them for "disturbing public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the most senior officer at the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not lead the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, to the south.
We saw the police expand the perimeter far beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
Almost 28 people were on the north side.
One of the brightest actions of the night took place south of the park.
At about 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped on the hood of a police car. Others were seen shooting tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood came up flying from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protestor were hospitalized.
School workers' union sues city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month, plans to bring a lawsuit to the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
Prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to try to have the dismissals annulled.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, co-ordinators of parents and other employees, who were among the city's lowest paid, lost their jobs on 7 October. The union leaders compared these dismissals to political revenge for not allowing the city access to a fund for health care led by the groups of workers, which would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this accusation.
At a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis Mr. Walcott stated that the layoffs constituted part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council replied, stating that the dismissals of school aids were not specified in any way in the budget.
The officers of the Council of the 37th District said they would complete a notice of complaint, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to officially announce legal proceedings at the State Supreme Court of Manhattan.
Dennis M. Walcott and the City's Department of Education will be the respondent. The complainants will be represented by eight laid-off workers, all of black or Latin American origin, like most school assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the city's legal department, stated that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of layoffs in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighbourhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most support due to regular underfunding.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and only a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed at Harlem's 36 public school, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecution claims that "It is not a district of well-off parents who can raise funds to fill the budget gap."
The budget for public school 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each enrolment of disadvantaged students.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "exceeding" to describe the action, although "exceeding" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixteen parents' coordinators were dismissed", and "not only because of overtaking".
Mission completed: Congress reached agreement on Libya's issue
Finally, it would appear that the Republicans and Democrats reached an agreement at the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It took a successful uprising, the capture and death of the long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachussetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is about honouring the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It's bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution to allow the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a large bipartisan margin and never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the financing of US operations in Libya.
The US mission therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress upset enough to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not enough to cut off the grass under its feet.
The indecision of Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Foreign Relations Committee "congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination towards freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the American armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also affirms "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure gain the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will it divide legislators as in June?
Senator and Commission Chair Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the last version.
His spokesperson said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of a new project.
Within the Capitol, this week the House must vote for an amendment to the Constitution in order to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans of Congress, and some Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but it is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments to be presented to Congress on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations from a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House of Commons only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that would "control federal spending".
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - especially the new Republicans who wish to sleep their CV - the chance to boast of being the "author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act approved last August called for the House and Senate to vote on a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators were voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of terms in which Congress members can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to lift the two-term limit for Presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to allow the annulment of federal laws if two thirds of the states are opposed to them.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as fast as they have been in the past.
At the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments and introduced 66 amendments at the 110th.
The pace slows compared to the early 1990s when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, based on figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacrée mais pas batée" says Gabrielle Giffords in her first televised interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man shot him at him at close range in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on Monday night on a television show, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted first of all to recover rather than return to Congress.
When Gabrielle Giffords appeared on TV news "20/20" on ABC, alongside Diane Sawyer, she struggled to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The show approached his difficult return after the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, replied "rather well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special one-hour edition of "20/20", broadcast the day before the release of the couple's new book entitled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special show traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the shooting on January 8.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, we see him on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a wide scar on his forehead.
She can use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sat in a wheelchair while doctors taught her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
Lip movement.
And finally, his first word, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours with the doctors every day, said she did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for the first time about the six people killed in the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being vigorously treated pending trial.
"There's been a lot of deaths," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
"So I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You were just massacred.
And you're gonna be okay, you're gonna get better and you're gonna be stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala at Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in the suit-travate stood at his feet to cheer him up.
"The military, both men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer at the gala, with the participation of Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Armed Forces, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were presented as a sort of orphan," wrote the military high-grade in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has developed between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some military.
The public is increasingly acting as if it were sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier-General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops to Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky minds."
This is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not wish to appear unrecognizable or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most conversations about pity take place confidentially among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the battle with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work at the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who gave him interviews asked in a subtle way whether he would be able to hold on to the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you approach the subject of service, you face negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely commended by a country so unfamiliar with the army and which sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as in World War II," declared retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people are largely focused on the depth of a soldier's suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of periods of service, the number of lost friends or the extent of injuries.
The army in the face of increasing pressure against rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she was reported to have been raped by a soldier.
It was October 2008, when she returned to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked her if he could join her in his room for a drink.
"It was an alarm signal," says Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texane has set aside its concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she says.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her from behind, thrown to the ground and raped, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still on duty and others not, will be anxiously waiting for the court decision at a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether a trial against former Secretary of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld will take place.
They are accused of not stopping the widespread rape within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 plaintiffs. This number was 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke claims to be attacking the gallooned military because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals?
Counsel also states that since February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom could be involved in future legal proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of bringing together all the plaintiffs in this case - thus putting all its eggs in the same basket - it will initiate several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defense, led by US lawyer Neil MacBride, tabled a motion to dismiss the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers on or off duty for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, called the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries sustained by personnel on active duty.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the complainants' military service" indicates the documents.
The Department of Defense refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to battle, this distinction is written only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only masculine.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in reaching out to local women.
As a result, of these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two thirds in combat.
It's time for the army to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three more trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Centre is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the Vietnam Veterans of America non-profit foundation is preparing a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorders" attributed to victims of rape in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a trial in December with the Veteran Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for persons who claimed to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defence.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, because according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that year.
The report published in March also looks at the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the army were the subject of a trial - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case described their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail about her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her attacker - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat before a judge at a trial where she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six persons testified as moral witnesses for the perpetrator, who eventually was acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down," says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commander, "It wasn't his trial but mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult with a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed under less than honourable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefit.
Will the Lyman case and the other complainants move forward or not, it's a long story, says John Turley, Professor of Law at the University of Washington Law School.
However, he pointed out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is found between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and deterrents of responsibility.
"The odds are heavy on them... but it's important that they try," he adds.
These things change only when the good ones have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favour, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other plaintiffs for further trials.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue until there is any reform," she says.
Or until we die, either of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy sharing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having been taken from murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, discussing with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on social media sites.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how can we find them?
Easy... Log in to Facebook.
"We realized that it wasn't that difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently published by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they are looking for with scientific precision - the way mercaticians have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of extreme right-wing groups in Europe. She targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to answer a survey. The questions asked concerned their level of education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"This is a new way of doing research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising at all: the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
DEMOS's study is just an example of how Facebook has become the new and indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all the topics that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to the "Like", publications on walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, the "data supernova" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research projects whose site name appears in the title by almost 800 % compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, Facebook's advantage is that it allows you to study people you could not approach on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You were supposed to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you in," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their drunken exploits were significantly more likely to be alcoholic than discreet students on this subject.
Megan Moreno suggested that student colleagues, such as counsellors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Children's Health, Behaviour and Development at the Research Institute for Children in Seattle, says the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would otherwise not be recognized."
Facebook also has constant access to the information of its users.
The data team of the site studied statistics on the love situation and Valentine's Day, the turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and a national happiness index (through information only available - digital freedom champions have for a long time argued that the site could make its data treasure available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometers away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation that they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is something else about it online.
"I don't think a lot of users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study that he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user's wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things," says Neil Selwyn.
That's why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notepad and a pen remain the best tools we can use.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social is not in front of a computer."
"Froid and inhumane": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first appearance at the Oslo trial.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templars," he explains in front of a hearing room filled with 500 people.
"As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I challenge it because you hold your mandate as organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a paper speech, talk to the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Justice Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others to make sure that he would be placed behind bars.
All of them participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found him cold and inhuman," said a Utoya survivor on Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally advanced a little after seeing and hearing the suspect."
With a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked the journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The attacks of 22 July therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I'd rather he looked like a monster, but that's not the case," said a relative of a victim.
"It would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the cinema this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical engineering and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recently discovered Steve Jobs interview that will be aired this week as the first part of a film in the main markets, is how much this creative spirit had understood the processes and workflow of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a flowchart enhancer - a man who believed that many business leaders were suffering from a "disease that they thought a great idea made 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple for about 10 years. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, aiming at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after Steve Jobs died that a full video was found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly up, is the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be aired at the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism reappears, when he seems eager to hear the questions of Cringely, giving him elbows to speed it up and move on to questions or topics of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, one finds a strangely prescient aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision on the future of computing.
It's one thing to read the posthumous reviews of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something crude and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can be and should be.
He explains them and then sets them in motion.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
On how he learned how to run a business:
"During all these years, I've always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are constantly the same: 'oh, just because we have to do them.'"
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by providing details on his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how the costs were recorded - one often starts with a "standard cost" evaluated from the nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory that guaranteed the precise calculation of the commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs recounts the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack telephone networks and phone for free in long distance.
The apparatus has been the subject of many writings beforehand, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped the ball in different things half a dozen times and you were screaming in the public phone and it happened to you a minute later on the public phone next door," says Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We didn't know much, but we were able to invent a little thing that could control great things. It was an amazing lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful trick that he and Wozniak developed: he called the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by pretending to be Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices leave in a wild laugh just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love for technology (and Bill Hewlett's pitch):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and made a phone call to him.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research labs, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed."
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode tube. I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was went back to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On Improvisation of Innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a head start.
At the beginning of his career, as he moved in to sell some printed circuit boards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembly and delivery of the finished appliances.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big fights... they yelled at me pretending it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that was incredibly reliable.
On the large companies that run out of steam:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs anticipated how many industrial leaders would be mistaken and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, and then?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [it's these types of people] who end up running companies and the specialized product staff are kept away from decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the required manual work.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They tore the defeat out of victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge piece of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
There are compromises to do... some things you can't do, the electrons can, the glass, the robots, the factories too.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by bringing them together.
Finally, decisions are made out of personal taste. It is about trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that the good artists are copying and that the great artists are stealing.
We're always ashamed of stealing great ideas.
This is in part what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who were simply the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with opponents of health law while the court meets
On the day the Supreme Court meets in camera to examine the question of political discord, whether the opposition to President Obama's health law will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case in the high court.
The event was held last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases concerned a trial by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that was a rallying point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges have agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental 5:30 p.m. argument is expected next March, and the result will probably be such as to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be booming as the court's decision is rendered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue on the rejection of the law, will likely be Paul Clement, who served as Solicitor General of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clément's law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society (Federalist Society) dinner, a long-standing group dedicated to upholding conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, top Republican of the Senate and declared opponent of the health law.
The star guests at dinner, Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would no doubt argue by the code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may attend fund-raisings of organizations related to law and others although the judge may not be an intervenor, guest of honour, or appearing on the program of such an event".
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was sufficient to alarm government ethics activists.
"This ethical violation and superb indifference to the Code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges were drinking and dining and at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event disassembles any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little respect for critics saying that they too easily mix court business with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a conservative high profile activist.
Moreover, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was Solicitor General of Obama's administration when the first oppositions to the law were brought to the level of the court of first instance.
Her critics lobbied Kagan to recuse herself from hearing the case, saying that she had too much to do in the defence of the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records a record $18 billion order for airliners
The Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777, double-roof airliners, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated market of over $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order contemplating 50 of its products.
This is a big deal, however, when the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record amount of $18 billion.
Equally incredible is who Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft with a total value of $450 billion in the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing informed of the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-couloirs.
It was the Emirates airline based in Dubai that placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Aerospace Show that the airline is also likely to purchase an additional 20 aircraft, raising the total order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated on Monday that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that flatters itself with significant fuel and convenience savings for passengers.
The amount of these six aircraft amounts to more than $1 billion.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar analyst.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have many of their airlines.
They therefore have not only the means to pay for these planes, but an increase in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them as the country would earn money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their aircraft orders when the price of oil increases, said Dihora.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
Emirates's order reinforces Boeing's dominance in the wholesale aircraft market and helps curb the attempt by the Airbus competitor to encroach on its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the Aeronautics Show came four months after Airbus announced that it would delay the start of the largest version of the A350, which competed directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus pushes back its beginnings to increase its thrust in response to its customers' demand to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
The shares of the Boeing company increased by 1.5% to reach 67.94 dollars.
The sister of the Mexican president clearly beaten in the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the run for governorship.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to become governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the top of the race for the post of governor of that western state.
"The involvement of organised crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon on the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election agents... they seized the ballot boxes, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood out only a few times from Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before election day.
Calderon, candidate of his brother's Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the office of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the presidential elections of 2012 for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any connection with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
The Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in trafficking in marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, violence has persisted.
A week before the elections a mayor of the PAN was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up locally on the campaign out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections seem, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD urges Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro area emerge from the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Director General of the Manila-based BASD, said the two economic powers with the fastest growth in the world must "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would help to avoid a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We're all in this crisis together."
"Therefore anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to some extent but it is not safe."
"So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan is dangerously skyrocketing and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The booming sovereign debt crisis in Europe has sparked the fear that the world economy will return to recession, and has sparked the call of the major emerging economies to come together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag foresaw that the IMF would deliver any Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - such as purchasing the obligations of the US Financial Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a decline in foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to face and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a choice, it's an imperative, because where would we find work for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help rich Europeans as they face their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get aid to Europe to the 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live on $2 a day or less.
"One day they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 years old and go on holiday in the sun and they will have trouble swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep many Greek officials well paid in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the railway sector.
Mr Nag said that the euro area crisis could have "significant repercussions" across Asia.
BASD's forecasts of economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 now face "risks of loss" due to the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed "emergency plans" to protect themselves from economic reversal and significant capital leakage.
Severe Pentagon Warnings on Potential Defense Reductions
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, put pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that the impending automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. He triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields, including civilian rallies.
The Pentagon already has $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but is now concerned that an additional $600 or more cuts will be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budgetary agreement resulting in so-called sequestration would result in 23% reductions and the freezing of many new projects.
"Such a significant reduction, applied so indiscriminately, would make most of our ships and construction projects unenforceable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or vessel - and seriously undermine other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly have to send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the objective."
"These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, continues Panetta.
"Although wartime funding of foreign contingency accounts is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in core budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contracting personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support war."
"The staff managing salaries would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war providers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Department of Defence.
"The consequence of kidnapping on the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power."
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," Senators said in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not the one we should impose ourselves".
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."
That Panetta's letter and recent warnings from senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been more and more virulent about possible cuts, even though he himself reached the highest position of the Pentagon with years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he faced difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what might happen - a soldier with a shell, but no nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that do not have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in his preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed force, ill-prepared and incapable of facing potential opponents."
"De facto, she invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could "create significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limitations on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk assumed in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could go to the cut, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the next generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat vessel and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Ending the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines shows how deceit and lies are pervasive in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
The administrators of Penn State were accused of perjury for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies have destroyed quarries and convulsed countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner, has come to be an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with violations of campaign funding related to the coverage of an extramarital liaison.
And then, none of those who have experienced history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton started by lying during his second term on her sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating at school and university tests are legion.
There have been instances where teachers have given the students the answers to the tests in order to get a good look at their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should teach the contrary send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many deceptions do we meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners were lying three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or spotting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a social game similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to exclaim: "I've had you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research of such projects, notably in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lies have been demystified.
The liars look at you in the eyes.
They don't stutter, blush, or get agitated.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to uncover.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, question formation and response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful for navigating in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are skilled in reading others well, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "centered" lies about them, while women say more "centered" lies about others - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as an unbeliever, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you say if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "establishing benchmark data."
This helps to provide a reference point for measuring future changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, the laughter, the vocal quality.
You need to know if someone normally moves his feet constantly so as not to make unfair accusations when you see him shaking his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for signs of verbal and non-verbal misleading behaviour.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceiving people can immobilize the upper body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet towards the door, lean towards an exit, change posture significantly or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions have passed.
Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is completed just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson derailed using the past while pretending that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceiving individuals can also use a different language: "I did not have sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat entirely a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember correctly... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be diverted after the threat of late approval by the United States
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - causing union anger while calming environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada stated on Monday night that it will move the proposed pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Nebraska Dune Zone, and is confident that the project will still gain its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain approval for a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogallala aquifer, large groundwater sources.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican at Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would probably have postponed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the involvement of politics in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the State Department, and expressed his support for it.
The 2.735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the Texas refineries.
To do so, it would have to cross six States.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have relied on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska legislators opposed to this plan pressure that a law force the remoteness of the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
While the State Department's ongoing environmental impact assessment found that the project would only pose limited negative environmental impacts, the energy industry stated that the Department's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A family in New York City says that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle, launched in an upsurge of violence in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she vomited it out of fear.
The tirade of the singer "Lady Marmalade" frightened little Geneviève Monk, 18 months old, to the point that she suffered "personal changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," said her family during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 of last year as stage technician Kevin Monk, his kindergarten teacher wife, Roseanna, and Geneviève prepared to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down into the lobby of their building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in his arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter down for a while.
"Someone came behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went to get her," she said.
LaBelle has angryly admonished the pregnant woman.
"She told me in an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't leave your daughter by the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "What you say or think I'm not interested in."
She got mad and started using swearing - the word "" and the word "" in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started spraying me water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I told that woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself at the mother - who was still holding Geneviève in her arms - and had to be restrained by her entourage who dragged her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started vomiting, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle's counsel and representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, stated that he took the case for free and that the family is considering donating all the money received to a charity against cancer for children.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," Davis said.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has slowed down the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment declined and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-called change, which generated high expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not seen, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, apart from causing trillion losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction in economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of allocations by frosts from the Mexican Sustainable Rural Development Council, there were 582 million 835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, maize and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity led, until November, to a steady rise in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the rate of unemployment of the State during the first three quarters of the year there was an accelerated increase, because while from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand Sinaloans unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we see is an increase in unemployment which is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who make dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work to win them, to invest them and to use them in something," he says.
Detained migration
López Cervantes reported that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad in the United States has been limited, firstly because of entry difficulties and secondly because by entering they already have a lot of difficulty in finding work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which means that unemployment is rising," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the Sinaloan labour market is getting worse by considering the high level of lack of seriousness which predominates between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state works there without contributing as a worker in any social insurance institution.
Apart from the unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for the lag for the state is the low wages, the entity has the lower wages of the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Prediction.
The average monthly income of Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average of 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contravention of FDI
Apart from the decrease in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, in 2011 there was the largest reduction of the Direct Foreign Investment of the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the State FDI has reached 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74 percent regarding the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
In view of the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the State requested in July at the public congress the approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reviving the economy, the approval of the State congress was 2,600 trillion pesos and until November no debt benefit was observed in any sector of the State economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the employer sector, Mario López Valdés' first year of government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wishes of the different sectors, ci-included the Government of the State.
"The efficiency of Sinaloa's economy during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have to align the effort of all and above all the good already synchronized march of this new government team, hope that next year is much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as the frosts of the beginning of the year have retained the state economy and restricted its yield and growth.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, between which the frosts, one of the main effects was a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level e flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, said that we want to channel the state towards productive activities of more dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources be detonated," he says.
A lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked hard and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to do," he says.
Sentenced for 8 kilos of marihuana
A person resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and 100 days' fine for possession of eight kilos of marihuana.
The Attorney-General of the Republic has informed that the convicted small dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for misdemeanour against health, in his variant possession of marihuana for sale.
In accordance with file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was travelling in a white pick-up truck, carrying a black bag in the vehicle's luggage rack and in the co-pilot's place a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements were made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Centre for the Execution of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debts towards contributions to books
Social works contemplated in programmes such as Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrants may not be finished where there are serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that although construction programmes have so far progressed, they are in a situation of risk, as the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to make contributions in excess of 11 million pesos in all three programmes.
He noted that in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipe have provided resources for the works, so there is the possibility of a delay in their finalization.
"They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end they have given us nothing, even if since July they had to give us a part of it," he said, "and we, in order not to record any delays, we started the books and we have advanced a lot, but we need the money".
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipe had to seek credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already suffered this in the previous sexnal period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to operate and this year, in order to have access to these programs, we had to get the resources to cover what the state had not paid for," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the managements so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they haven't given us anything."
Court validates "analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analogue signals by digitals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has rejected the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogous cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been brought together.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to follow in order to realize the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was rejected for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because the regulation of radio and television is a statutory allocation to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
In favour of the draft voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions provided by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of the ministers also rejected the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister President said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure the measures for the preparation of the public administration through general standards.
"I also consider that it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, whose constitutional mandate is the direction of the State.
The substitution of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years and this translates into better radio spectrum operation, better signal quality and more channels.
To maintain the change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitalization which implies a decision of public interest that does not only have a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he stressed, "require the operation of a whole system establishes, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a group of responsibilities which the Constitution grants to the power of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries from all over the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have the highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, has invaded in a form the sphere of competence of Congress, for it ensures in the administrative sphere the respect of the laws issued by the Legislative, he asserted.
Analysis of the possibility of a vote-by-vote count in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Programme of Preliminary Electoral Results (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, in the past, 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with federal reform in electoral matters.
It will be recalled that Michoacán did not approve either his Constitution Policy or his State Electoral Code or his Electoral Justice Act, at the same time as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for the entry into force of this electoral trial, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the time limits provided for by the Law of the State Official Journal, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state representative for constitutional reforms, as it does not have the right to "sanction or challenge".
Interviewed on the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to make partial and total counts of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there are no voting minutes and counting in the file of the ballot box is not at the President of the ballot box; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the votes received in all ballot boxes of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the candidate supposed to be the winner of the respective election and the candidate who obtained the second place in the election is equal to or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the party representative and/or coalition that presented the second of the candidates reported.
The total count of the vote may also be carried out if at the end of the common count it follows that the difference between the candidate who is supposed to win and that of the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express petition from the representative of the political party whose candidate has come out second, in which case the electoral packages which were the subject of the partial count shall be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
Its ashes will be spread in the Zapalinamé Sierra, confirms the family.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday around night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a requiem misse.
According to his family, Lieutenant-Colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be spread in the Zapalinamé Sierra.
After receiving tributes from the other people who died in the accident, Bacio Cortés' family returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest people attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of Lieutenant Colonel Garza arrived at the vigil chapel of Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family and friends went.
At 5:30 p.m., he was presented with tributes to the Saltillo Technological Institute organized by his former technological baccalaureate colleagues and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was a member when he was preparing for the baccalaureate.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes were spread in the Zapalinamé Sierra, he always said this "to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, she considered that he was in the fullness of his life, "he had success, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and very much cared for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, because they said he even had a bad truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as this was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for the graduation of his parent, for that reason he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
His last farewell
With honours it was said goodbye to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, a tribute to Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Saltillo Technological Institute, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself both in studies and in sport.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, next to the Secretary of Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and other six people, all officials of this service.
The remains of the pilot Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 hours to be handed over by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the esplanade of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and other parents, students and teachers.
Three abandoned corpses, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found murdered with gunshots fired in different parts of the body and with the blow of grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who passed through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has beige color and coffee the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, approximately three meters away, they located the corpses of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; on his side there was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
At one meter away there was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying on the belly.
According to in situ data, all three persons had been murdered in another location, as in situ casings were not found.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by a group of organized crime towards the other, apart from some bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence presented 11 persons, including a minor, who formed part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to have relations with kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to reports, in a first incident on 11 November in the Los Alveros settlement eight people were arrested and one who had been deprived of liberty was saved.
They were confiscated three buildings and one cell phone; they claimed to be part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another fact that took place on November 12 at 06:00 hours, military personnel made a surveillance journey to Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, by detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
By stopping them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on November 13 at 2:00 p.m. one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape when he saw the military.
They are attributed clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has endangered the whole Eurozone.
A communiqué from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in its majorities by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will assume his position.
Monti said he was going to present to the president the result of his conversations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for Journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
The "frame is now well drawn," he added.
Monti has completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to levels impossible to sustain.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
By stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the yield of the Italian bonds BTP at 10 years above 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot".
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's potential for success was greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, to which the crisis forced him to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told the press.
PDL's support, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will probably be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any deadlock or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He'll finish his meeting tour Tuesday through the night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who empowered an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for Eurozone's current financial defences.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the forthcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before advancing the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should be formed only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have pointed out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish experience is superior to that of Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convokes participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, compared with the 22 convoked by the two countries for today's amicale, at 3:05 pm, at the National Stadium of San José.
While the national and European champions, the number one in FIFA's monthly rankings, count a large register of class A interselection games, the Habs only have defenseman Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of the Stars and in powerful clubs of the First League of England, maintain an intense year-round activity in national league and cup championships and fights in European Cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated playoffs of the European Cup and the World Football.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish Selection is that of goaltender Íker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equalled the record of former goaltender Andoni Zubizareta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Habs and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, a brain flyer from Barcelona, is 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zubizareta mentioned above with 126 and the avant-centre of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Ready for the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five exceeded the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 attendances, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Elder Nelson are still beginning.
The historical scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz recorded the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream come true to happen in this country.
It is that bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva of Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-decade-of-work celebration tour and Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day will be on the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles The X group and the Las Robertas Nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcription of which is found in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been grandiose.
I spent only one holiday in Costa Rica; it is such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So it's exciting to carry our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, fans live intensely the previous days.
What is your message to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying next to us for all these years.
It took 21 years for us to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to pass until this concert.
Some people already say his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some pressure to your visit.
Some of the bigger shows we've been offering in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We have offered two gigantic shows to Sao Paolo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to doing so.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends always went surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learned it, through the people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you have offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never been there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to do the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to perform two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the directory.
What is this supposed to be?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can perform more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that's why it's very difficult to choose which songs to perform each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played in a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of why we love these songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don't think either of us had imagined that we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together makes us very emotional.
We love each other and love to create music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world to which we have always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to form part of this group of major groups.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we took part in a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to be still friends with all of them and it's an honor for us to form part of that Seattle sound that came out.
It's as strange as a band like yours keeps united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much more time than many groups normally last.
First, I think we're all lucky to be alive, and second, we're all concerned about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and that could not be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great multitudes and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect the music and what brought it, without thinking about the fact that we're famous and a rock star, which doesn't really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and we didn't publish a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There's been a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important thing is that we're still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think about the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and much more with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and for that you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and this one was the band we liked the most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very entertaining.
What do you always change Yello Ledbetter's lyrics for?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first ones I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep up the grunge despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I've just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who came up at the same time and, if it's relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now doing the best music ever.
At first, his music had a more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even though they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose to a parent or friend, these things start to influence your art and music and these songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
I also think we can also be happy and even so we can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former president Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he presents in the piles, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a sentence of 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000) suffers from various conditions, including a language cancer for which he has been operated four times and which is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, said for TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the remission of sentence for humanitarian reasons, no doubt he said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
It has been operated four times of tongue cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kg, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the feet, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving prison sentences since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the Police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squadron that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of various ministers and bosses, will launch a visit to Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with political, trade and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be "propice for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its web page.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when the French agent, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a declaration that led to the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations by its ambassador from that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group made up of the world's stronger emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 'gri list', which is being integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
On the trade side, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Treaty (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu plumber goes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the wicked Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at stores all over the world, was designed from the beginning to fully exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who must say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for this support", because so far hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows a fast and smooth game.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to do a "second round" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an aggressive "D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario into the three dimensions also presupposes the return of the character to a mobile console, a fact that was no longer happening since 2005.
In these Nintendo video games makes a nod to the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of success of the previous games, which consists in the fact that the moustachu plumber has to traverse platforms mined of perils to free Princess Peach.
Even if I am a player, I find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the case of Luigi "playable".
Colom approves Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of 70 million US dollars.
Thus, the trial ends so that Guatemala can respond to the request of the northern country that requested Portillo to try him there.
At a press conference, Colom claimed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and he had given way to all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done involves an executive process after exhausting all judicial and constitutional bodies to try the former 2004-2004 representative.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and after having guaranteed his human rights.
Portillo was absolute for misappropriation of funds of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial that preceded extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The record of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter century.
In addition to this is the long centenary of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the objective of helping people who are poorly trained, without work, with problems of drug addiction or marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who in these 25 years collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the election season, showed the unitary nature of Trinijove's work.
Besides the president of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former socialist minister of education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor to the mayor and current eco-socialist municipal councillor Ricard Goma.
The present minister of Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the general director of charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, were also present in the large hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president gave Trinijove as an example to help fight the wrong circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-feasts, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of Rue Balmes 51 lived ended.
Twelve people left at noon yesterday voluntarily the building they occupied illegally and where they organized micro-fests that despaired the neighbours, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took away the electrical installation and part of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of any kind, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass celebrations, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained for Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied, its business dropped a 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property gave him unfair jurisdiction, because they sold the glasses at three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
Moreover, the owner of the leisure space had had to respond to complaints from neighbours about the noise, while, according to the latter, the troubles were not caused by the guests of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants of the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irritated neighbours of the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the troubles were so great that she even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since he "forgive" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours about this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end with the problems of living together and civicism that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last months the squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost all apartments and that in some apartments there were also flights.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must end with impunity and be implacable against antisocial behaviour generated in the property".
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police moved to number 35 of Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide on the advisability of convening beyond the controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, in the midst of the already extinguished Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed promotional posters of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park once again became, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not focus on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park except Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a mega-competition composed by 16 contests for all access gates to Collserola.
A door puts the idea of a park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appears on its own: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organisation and with regard to the reflection on the city is a topic of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona.
It's almost a recurring theme that two members of this former caste of elected officials talk about when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, came together.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on "the mountain front" because the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, that of green blocks of houses has not been completed.
"It is necessary to start from the base that the larger park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", the architect gave the verdict for which the title of "Portes de Collserola" contains a "lexic trap": it is not necessary to think of these "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some perils".
The perils that derive from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience lived in the '80s and which had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step", that is, exceeding it.
"We must think of new urban planning instruments, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (MPP) ] can cause genuine disasters".
By sticking more to the question, Modol opine than, by simplifying, the slope of the region El Valles de Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronate of Collserola that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers to its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "doubt" if this technical profile is to lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all success", he says) that we had to create: "We architects should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because the basics of the contest lack a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-versal competitions have been called - he says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
At least in this case, he chose to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the program and define with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In its opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the band immediately superior to that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that makes a gentle transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and this one will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal authority of Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After having spent 72 years arrested, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red grants him forgiveness before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly required him to pay for an economic quotte so that the mayor of Monterrey would allow the underground operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the mayor of PANiste and on 2 September he was arrested and held under provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours in front of Public Prosecutor's Office Officer 3 of Patrimonial Delitions, he was transferred to Detention Centre 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when a second detention order was issued after the Public Prosecutor's Office had dismissed corruption and organized crime offences.
On October 19 he was transferred to the criminal center of Cadereyta allegedly for blackmailing the owners of the Red Casino with one and a half million pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the medium security detention centre because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, a catch order was issued by the clerk of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonás' guilt, such as that relating to the receipt of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for its operation.
This Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, presented himself before Judge José Luis Pecina to ask forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could regain his freedom during the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the public prosecutor's officer attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who had been the partner of the gambling house who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
According to file 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is legally pardoned and no claims can be made about the trial against him; no compensation or punishment will be sought.
After the hearing of the lawyer of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Registrar of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been pardoned legally and his file would be closed.
He will also inform him of the immediate order of freedom issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives the details of the air accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake and other seven people lost his life
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the accident in which Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people lost their lives indicate that the helicopter directly shocked the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, reported that prior to the aircraft's take-off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage".
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so the unit met the necessary requirements to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that investigations in the impact area do not report the appearance of ground parts.
"In one search it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact was structural.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The soil had a pant of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the moment, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that the moment of impact, the State Major Presidential helicopter was operating in cruise speed and this happened on a soft rising ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruiser operation at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, the SCT holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual theft:
According to aeronautical standards, the flight was conducted according to visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM indicated adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft advanced towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico, there were layers of low-level nebulosity.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the nebulosity conditions the crew looked for a lower height area and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available to date suggests that the impact has occurred on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The aircraft's residual dispersion model assumes that the helicopter struck the ground under structural integrity conditions.
Traces of fire or explosion have not been detected:
At the accident site there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of any type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contact with the ground.
During the fieldwork, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9,200 feet above the average sea level, and the ground had a slope that has been going from seven gradients to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have disarticulated himself along his journey.
The information provides evidence that suggests that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful search in a larger area than the surrounding area, around the accident, dispersed parts of the aircraft were not found, which supported the presumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find the obesity gene
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the obesity gene for children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is leading an investigation to discover the obesity gene for children and young people, called the 'Genetics of Obesity of Children and Adolescents' protocol that will allow to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Investigation Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialities of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Investigation and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation it is invited to participate the population who are entitled or not, to present themselves to the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the evidence is made to the minors every Saturday from 8:00 am.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtemoc Sport Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October the activity takes place in the Sport Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sportive Independencia Unit (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sportive Morelos Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that of knowing the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and of identifying risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on 14 November, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of the specific questionnaires relating to diet.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their history of family inheritance of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, size, height circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, and insulin and genetic levels will be applied to all participants (people associated with childhood obesity are being identified).
Cruz López pointed out that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in only six years there was an increase in the proportion of boys in obesity of 77 per cent and in the proportion of girls in 47 per cent; in the case of overweight there was also a dramatic increase', the IMSS specialist pointed out.
He indicated that the rationale for finding markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from the others because of its genetic history.
He informed that on average, Mexicans have a 65 percent Indo-American heredity, a 30 percent European and a five percent African, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn excess energy that is consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the participants is the full assessment of children, which makes it possible to detect whether they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark-coloured folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearms indicates the probability of suffering metabolic and even pre-diabetes alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, and physicians provide it to parents in writing, explaining each of the measures and lifestyle changes they need to take to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarianism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of TV and use means of transport instead of going on foot for short distances.
Another cause is the high calorie intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamals - meat paté with corn flour wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, burgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid blackcurrants
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better efficiency, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the pavement were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand blackcurrants each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the asphalt pavement is adequate, the blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A technological opinion on blackcurrants, organized within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture having characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with a greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera considered that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the yield, and therefore the formation of blackcurrants.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a lower molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, almost 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warns the chemical engineer.
The QF researcher observed that the majority of the streets of Ciudad de México were covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, the last three involving asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones forming the layer, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it by generating effort, it allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, it would spread better, opinated the chemical ingener.
On the asphalt layer, he says, one puts a last layer called a rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
Since this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt layer and provide grip on the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the forces, the bearing layer also requires that it be of adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, because they significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil wets, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to come out, which softens all layers of the pavement and therefore causes blackcurrants.
In the process of forming a blackcurrant, he says, the first one that spoils itself is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Researcher System explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of blackcurrants and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be linked to the load of vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent formation of blackcurrants.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that made Melina Ramírez Serna not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives her princess title number 14.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle with being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver wreath and the band that accredits her as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico climbed with the crown and the sceptre, the department already totals 14 titles of Princess and Melina one to a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who found themselves near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, among which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many people are asking is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Fair Face of Vogue, titles obtained by queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who won the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the juror's decision to appoint her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? asked by Martín Murillo Gómez, de la Carreta Literaria Leamos.
This is the answer of candidate de Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it is a form of culturalization, definitely I believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it is a rather deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The ardor of blood".
First of all, this answer did not appeal to the term "culturalization" and second, not to explain in concrete terms how each book cited marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony stated that she felt quiet and happy with the result "the universe and wise, what is going to happen is going to happen.
And for everyone, please read, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Between the assumptions made is that Valle was destroyed by favouritism.
A journalist from Bogota insinuated that being the favourite, the ovationd and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (the Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "that awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on the stage".
And that was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Even though at the two parades she had seemed certain of herself, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist with the "Como en casa" program (As at home), of the RCN Canal said that the fact that Melina was designated a princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the prizes during the contest does not receive the queen's crown".
In addition, Valle avoided the press in the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That's why two days before the election international juror Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensibility, that before starting the Contest are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by her flaws of her back and the fibrosis that was observed in her abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected her as the candidate 'Natural beauty' with the body healthier, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queen preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her fibrosis problem on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too notorious, left her points on the last day".
Meanwhile journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the candidate of Valle were the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"Surgeries are good, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of this aspect."
For this prize, which the National Beauty Contest presents for the first time, after the swimsuit parade came up a cruel prediction that happened last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina so as not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will pass through history as one of the queens who despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
So was the work of Cali's person who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A typist from Cali has passed to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
The past November 4 a typist of the CTI of Cali has passed to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme chief of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists who work in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was the turn of "availability" of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to arrive at the place where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after attending appropriate courses, he specialized in typoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar had been warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be the man who was running the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the dead body, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, as it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much leaner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a pre-elevator and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme leader of the Farc.
Looking for the fingerprint
For a typist from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Eliazar González in a press conference for the operation against "Cano" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Typing is an exact science, without margin of error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
Apart from identifying the corpses, typists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many offenders present false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher testified that in one case of theft he had to remove a part of a wall from a house, because in that place the thief had pressed his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate areas to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint with all the hand and identify the offender who had participated in various robberies," he recalls.
Fingerprints may also dismiss or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently a dead man was found, with bottles of drink around him.
By investigation, it was determined that a parent may be suspect of the crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee that he's the killer, it puts him at the crime scene.
A CTI typist explained that "the fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents" are extracted.
When they appear, a pre-releaser or tape is used to remove them.
Subsequently, the prints are sent to Asif, the database of the declines, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers," said the expert from the ITC.
He explained that not everything is how we show in the CSI television program.
Like everything that shines is not gold, everything you touch does not necessarily become a fingerprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The "indignant" defy the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were rushing in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people accessed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The integrations of the Occupe Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to enter again, thanks to a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Apple.
Hundreds of protesters were rushing in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a judicial order that allows the 'indignant' to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," says one of the spokespersons of the movement "Occupe Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the 'indignants' to the evacuation of their personally dictated camp by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Justice Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the 'Indignates' occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street power stations and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested a few protesters, even though Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are hundred years of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of the members of the movement and tried to intervene in favour of them before the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a private property compound - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday during which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analysed.
Some of the protesters who had been displaced so far were carrying and distributing copies of this judicial order at that time and they even handed it over to the agents who were watching the square, which caused 'some small clashes', Bray said, who denounced the fact that some officials hit the demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from evacuating the members of Occupe Wall Street or from applying 'laws published after the beginning of the occupation or from prohibiting demonstrators from re-entering the park with tents or other properties they used previously'.
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, as a result of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and demonstrators, but warned them that local laws did not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The City Councillor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn in Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and decided on because of the fact that the demonstrators were 'in violation of the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the square to be evacuated because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases to hurt others", because "some shops had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The evacuation this morning at dawn has been repugnant and shows that deep down Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
The leaders of "Occupe Wall Street" also indicated that they do not plan to organize "great actions" on Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protest, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV program
Next to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be released on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescuer in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program on Canadian television.
Private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, next to the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 performing a very special Virgin Mary.
Today, CTV distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide-spreading on the Internet of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed like the Virgin Mary by supporting in a crib a doll that represents to Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian actor of Indian origin who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appeared as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Noel program also features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who himself is not far from the controversies.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian 'pute' during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP rises a 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March the Japanese economy was paralyzed, recovering again after the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe in the Japanese country since World War II.
The initial estimates of the Tokyo Government calculated the material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September were used to turn the page permanently: GDP increased one 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and one 6% in annualized rates.
That recorded in the second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also assumes, in addition, the greatest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the post-tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the decrease of 0.9% of capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decrease after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - the infrastructure, to use the deficiencies to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up mainly thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refusal values" elected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in Eurozone and the disturbances predicted by the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their low performance between July and September for the yen's contribution.
While markets continue to have their seats in the outlying EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not decline guard.
"We must monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) mentioned that the majority of member countries presented clearer signals of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are being restrained.
Because it has dropped four decimals to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone has even been below the average, which is in level 100, falling eight decimals to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds back the doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to immerse itself in the maze that leads to the end of the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellen Transitional Government is imposed rather by the demands of Brussels than by a real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, reported yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the one hundred-day period established in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date, that of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October," said Papadimos when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras no's message raises doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have committed ourselves to nothing more".
The conservative leader has gone a step further in his pulse than EU and IMF, the bodies that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently requires, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the va-tout of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not release the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Hellene parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, even if there is no definitive date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasises the "preponderant" position of Spain with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a dominant place at the global level in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofía recalled that over the past two decades the country has become the world's second largest donor to this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the V-th World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations for 2015, and, "especially, in that which aims to reduce to half the volume of people living with incomes under one dollar a day, to which is fixed the "threshold of poverty".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the world, and takes on this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originated during the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "achieved many goals" and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to push "two basic goals".
For example, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The impetus in the conception of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized Queen Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she has known for 15 years when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to know on the ground her lending policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the qualifier of "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid by the "banker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofía ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Etique imperative"
Foreign Affairs Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, she stated that it would be a mistake to vinculate cooperation with developing countries at times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits imply "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to "excluded people to whom all close the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with a spirit of solidarity".
CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, was without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme but was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the activists who consider the policy of the government too lax vis-à-vis the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which, at the end of their interventions, Angela Merkel and, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very europhile finance minister, did not give way to doubt.
The Chancellor's - and the motion's - idea is based on a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less of Europe but more of Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could lead to amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give a face to Europe".
This is, in any case, one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will soon agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also hostile.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the Executive Board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which obviously amounted to reinforcing Germany's weight.
In an effort to calm the climate within her party, the Chancellor has multiplied references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has also not sought to win her congress on the back of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty who are quick to criticize the arrogant Germany.
While the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the hollow.
Remembering that two centuries ago Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does sickness arrest fraud mean?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on sick stoppages.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund, and deliver a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less heralding an axis of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority wants to focus on sick stops.
First of all, with a view to budgetary savings: the government plans to impose a fourth day's waiting period on employees of the private sector before taking care of a stoppage of work.
In short, without a specific company agreement, an employee who becomes ill would lose four days' pay, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could provoke anger, but would yield 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
This would be accompanied by another, more symbolic measure: to impose a day of unremunerated deficiency on civil servants in the event of a stoppage of work (until now they have no waiting period, compared with three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority is also reviving the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.
"The controls will be much more important and, if you are taken, you will pay back," warned Xavier Bertrand at RTL's microphone on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the publicity effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of work stoppage fraud.
Since 2002, this has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives, which have mostly borne fruit.
The French are not sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
Let us focus first on the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, in 2008 daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure, with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this sum, 46% concerned maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% concerned sick leave, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
And thus 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French had an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides some discrepancies: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any sick days.
Another study, this time of Sickness Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was of a duration of less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more inclined than elsewhere to stop work.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) varied between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud at sick stoppages represents very little in the face of work in the dark.
As for fraud, it is only a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that checks are systematic on sick leave for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term stops were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of stops of more than 45 days, systematically checked, there were 11% "unsuitable or unjustified" cases out of 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, 169,000 "unjustified" cases out of several million employees who had a sick stoppage.
A figure which represents very little, for example, of work in the dark.
According to MP UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the matter in June, the latter would amount to 9 to 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud against them.
Papadémos: Greece to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to correct its economy.
That is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said to Parliament on Monday 14 November, adding that the 100 days given to his union government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"We need the support of our European partners and a new fiscal adjustment programme to continue efforts to recover the economy," said the Head of Government, who gave his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr Papadémos has forecast that the country's public deficit will be reduced "by around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after having been 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, supported on Monday the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit itself to further austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with his party's deputies, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and of combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without any written guarantee from all the parties they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his speech was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
We must legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says a committee of experts
Canadians live in the denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in the denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements for it.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, with the participation of six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, with a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the outset, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reports the experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, this rate is highest in Quebec, with 86% of deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on non-competent or non-consensual persons.
On the contrary, said yesterday in teleconference Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, there would be more cases of these outbursts precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in Support of Euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
As for those who have performed assisted suicide, respondents estimate that they should not be prosecuted at 41%.
In terms of patient retention or cessation of care, the situation is less clear, says the report authors.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it should be stated in the Criminal Code that withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect a denial of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with respect to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee asks that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations by other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described the position of the experts who signed the report as "extreme", among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to the terminally ill.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old could ask for help to commit suicide," said Mr Deschamps, who yesterday had consulted a summary of the report.
Mr. Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the individual's autonomy above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
"In society," he says, "there are beacons and constraints."
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she called a "pro-euthanasia demonstration".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes in particular the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is becoming more and more isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs premises.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Bashar al-Assad's Syria, which, with Russia's support, resists them and denounces a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took a stand in favour of a departure of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces were still killed.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, deplored the failure of the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country towards which Turkey is adopting an increasingly harsh line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a "strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces perished in the Dar'a region of southern Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians perished "when heavy machine guns were exchanged and shelled in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem felt that the country was "leading towards the end of the crisis".
It has also reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its work, which it believes constitutes a "hazardous step".
Syria "will not decline," he added, assuring that "the Urdis conspiracy against Syria will fail."
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also expressed his support for the dispatch of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which according to him is locked in the "paranoia".
A new special meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the protested cities and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, yesterday judged the decision of the Arab League to be "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the plan to end the crisis, while refraining from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti takes time from markets and sacrifices from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has requested some time from the markets to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the lost credibility in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting the trade unions and employers today.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting the President-designate of the Council.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to ask for a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a short list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bond markets yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are specific deadlines" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying "certain that markets will be patient and understand".
Its appointment by the President had initially been welcomed by the markets, but concern picked up in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should form a team of technocrats in particular, although he stressed that he would like to include "policies".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti undertook, once he had taken office, to work urgently and with the aim of "becoming a protagonist" for Italy in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of balanced budgets in 2013, despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for, among other things, new austerity measures.
The Italian "patron of bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot respect the deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolising "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place by April 2012 200 billion euros in state bonds.
Russian scientist helped with Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, said on Monday an American NGO specializing in atomic risk.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, drawing heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet nuclear military centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural), and was allegedly involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then reportedly cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before his return to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA refers to "strong indications that Iran's development of a nuclear detonation system" was assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked for most of his career on this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Muslim crimes and offences increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or little, according to FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49%, compared with a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in offences against Jews and an overall 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and offences.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes increase again," said Human rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the organization's leaders, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to tackle these abuses," he added, thinking that this could involve improving police reports on "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual affiliation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
On Monday, the micro-blogging Twitter site introduced changes in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allow you to follow more legibly, live the activity of the other "Twittos", the users whose messages are followed ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows us to know whether they are following messages, whether they subscribe to new accounts, whether they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast across the network on Monday, told AFP Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive functioning, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rebroadcast a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the insiders happy, thus opening up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the mainstream Facebook and Google+ networks.
On the network, users were suddenly debating the value of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
inclusion of a budgetary "golden rule" in the constitution
The government of the ruling Social Democratic/Christian Democrat coalition in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a "golden rule" budget in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible deterioration by the rating agencies of Austria's sovereign rating (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision at the end of a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's creditworthiness was reduced by only one notch, from AAA to AA+, we should pay an additional €3 billion in interest each year," argued Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus responding to a request from the Brussels summit of the euro area member countries on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the federal government's structural government deficit will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The aim is to bring public debt up to 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen fort
Noda threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise.
"We will act as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, said Mr.Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen went back close to the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just set a new record of strength since 1945 against the green note.
But the yen has since been regularly raised, boosted by purchases from investors who see it as a "refuge value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar is crossed Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro has dropped below the symbolic bar of the 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro over 160 yen.
This surge in Japanese currency is detrimental to the archipelago's exports as it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of Japanese firms' foreign earnings when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11 that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), stressed Mr. Noda who fears that the rising cost of the yen will kill in the egg the fragile recovery.
The third world economic power returned to growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in the exports and consumption of households led by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considered that the high cost of the yen did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", suggesting that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion), increasing the ceiling of the amounts it spends on purchases of various financial securities to 55,000 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
rates go up, stock exchanges go up
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of vulnerable countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges are sinking further into negative territory on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt yields 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With the new pressures on the yields of euro area countries in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down by 0.7%, in turn suffering renewed fears from market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a corridor of narrow variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area is penalizing the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At around 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, it declined after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion providing in particular for the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian bonds at 10 years old reached 6.85%, that of Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the countries of the South, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the speakers.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has demanded time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain finds itself in the forefront of markets, while on Sunday parliamentary elections in the country are held.
The spread gap between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical high.
Pending euro area growth figures
On the statistical side, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected, driven by household consumption.
However, INSEE revised the second quarter figure downwards, with a 0.1% decline in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than stagnation.
And, it's really the fourth one that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded an increase of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11:00 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is one subject which cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is indeed energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is healthy that an election meeting should be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear power there.
The debate will be fruitful only if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic change will lead to a doubling of demand for electricity by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources will have to be overcome in order to continue to produce electricity permanently, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a subject that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case with Belgium, which is subjecting its own to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor with Switzerland, which just intends to build only last generation power plants.
On the other hand, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, are pursuing their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to its park by resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
While the German model, which focuses on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality upsets discourse.
Berlin's choice will result in higher electricity prices, an increase in energy dependence aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, particularly from Russia, a surge in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these unfortunate effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is to be considered.
He is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of the wind, from which he draws 30% of his electricity, so that his CO2 emissions and the price of his electricity are 65% and 50% higher respectively than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than those of French households.
Whereas in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the least expensive electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would result in a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make illusory the fine declarations on the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price which a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not show opposition in principle to this energy, the polls show.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Highly exportative, it leads to a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and makes them very creative of non-localizable jobs.
If France were to decide to leave nuclear power, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the annual €6 billion worth of French exports of nuclear equipment and services as a source of grief.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to operate for sixty years when the decline of its manufacturer would be scheduled?
In order to solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miracle electricity generation, no more than there is a diabolical one.
The development by Areva of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
We have in France a Safety Authority which exercises intransigent and transparent control over existing power plants as well as on the Flamanville yard.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession of safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
At Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that have caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did for the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between safety authorities, operators and manufacturers in France and Germany, the EPR presents a design that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians who want to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the way to seize the leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers to dominate such a decisive debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - congestion of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the number, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "human rights countries" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has come to light, the Minister of the Interior (read Libération of 23 May) proclaiming that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant waiters".
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a fairly broad consensus on this issue between the left and the right.
To the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million migrant workers", and to the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared to the left and right.
For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be given to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to trivialities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may pay electorally; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book synthesizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration anemia growth and impairs employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they are likely to replace national workers, especially low-skilled workers, who are putting downward pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mostly in occupations in sectors in need of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors in which training does not follow the supply of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants mean that arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri has thus calculated that an increase of 1% in migration flows results in an increase between 0.6 and 0.9% of real wages in the long term.
And this does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the U.S. Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of EUR 150000 to public budgets on average over his entire life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to look for the missing growth points "with teeth".
The teeth in question, when used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would be enough for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies to vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little", that this was an easy thought.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become an "instrument of oppression" as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, education, Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just as much, and first and foremost a crisis of politics and democracy.
In this respect, the palinodia of the true-false Greek referendum has had the value of double revealing: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought of in order to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now moved, and that, for many of them, Republican soldiers no longer shoot in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized as necessary and in a dispersed order.
A blanc-seing with the absolute European monarch or a joint jump in the vacuum of nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cuts, but a common exercise, of full right, serene and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - there is no more way to stop enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that bends to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is Europe as a whole that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the leadership of the European project.
It is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The end of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After long fighting this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for the European economic government.
Fine.
But thinking this without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by the citizens, would be a new folly and a new impasse.
We must take on a new stage in the construction of Europe.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" republicans.
The Revolution in Interests could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, a true European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
"Contactless" smart cards are becoming more widespread
The smart card world show opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
Indeed, 2011 is expected to end on an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, SIM phone, etc.), to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most promising segment is contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or pay for your purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold around the world, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to grow further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and account for almost 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Long behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the big surfaces put the double bites.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To move up speed, banks must now equip their customers.
"Two major French institutions have committed themselves to systematically distributing to their customers bank cards equipped for contactless customers in the future," says Gérard Nébouy, General Manager Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to perform transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should finally have a real boom next year."
"We are talking about the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 around the world," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a contactless payment case.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And the Société Générale, too, said yesterday that it was preparing to put on the market an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front spreads
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-held links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
"The way in which the two organisations operate and the intelligence services' reports show that there is good cooperation," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January reportedly revealed bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of past calls focuses on several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has spent a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who claims to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward but we must probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" had been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in his modus operandi, which now involve the use of kamikazes or explosive devices that are increasingly complex and of the same invoice as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illuminates of little interest.
A rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haoussa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict respect for the sharia, while its militants engage in the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are aimed primarily at churches, bars, and administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army is investing in the city, with 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
From then on the sect will radicalize and leave its northern fiefs.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked the security headquarters of the police in Abuja during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the UN headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria is now a matter of concern to all security professionals.
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, while Somalis in al-Shebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was "ready to share all the information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete for simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
To listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
Over the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have multiplied the tone and shortening of foreign policy, traditionally a strong republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans - often unsubstantiated - are emerging.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the race for the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese to the WTO and question them "for the manipulation of their currency", a theme in an America exasperated by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
So much the worse if it involves the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's ex-ambassador in China and the only candidate for a sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost strangled in the face of an attitude that "flashes" emotions.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing ( Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Like Reagan.
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop his nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best placed candidate, shows an embarrassing ignorance of the files.
Recently, he called to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "try to develop a nuclear capability" - apparently unaware of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the US army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his anti-terrorism wine.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, on his tergiversations in Libya, thus sticking to him a label of weakness.
But the attack isn't that easy.
The population considers Obama's national security record, which eliminated Bin Laden, to be rather positive.
Since Iraq, she has been wary of military interventions that lead to a breakdown.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to revive its leadership, Obama strikes more just.
The Nord Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, directly connecting Western Europe and Russia via the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It must supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brilliance.
More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, this new pipeline that directly connects Russia under the sea with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart in the Netherlands Mark Rutte have together turned the steering wheel of the valve commanding the entry of Russian gas into the West European network.
With this new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe through a first tube of 1,224 km linking the St Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube is due to be completed by the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And we already talk about the possibility of building a third one on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and hour of this huge construction site looks like a victory.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any overland passage by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to close its access to western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream with a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is to say, the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has been able, in just five years, to triumph over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily gas-consuming and whose deposits are in decline.
"This gas pipeline is a part of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," confirmed François Fillon by inaugurating this gas pipeline, demonstrating how political and economic the major gas contracts are.
All this explains the wide smiles displayed by Gazprom's leaders, present in numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-coated steel to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average distance of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be abducted or destroyed, as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesperson for Nord Stream.
There was also a need for more measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts over its entire length: no valve, no maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project authorities abandoned it while the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state-owned company permanently set up off their coasts.
"In case of damage, we stop the passage of gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered unlikely by manufacturers who have planned the welds to leak every 100,000 years.
Monitoring of the condition of the pipeline is carried out by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for outdoor observation, as well as by an aircraft that is circulating inside the pipeline.
From the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, one meter wide, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters second, he gives precise information on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo any repairs.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
It is 200 bars on departure, and 100 on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, who holds 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture, named Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It has its seat in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to the company, for 20 renewable years, all the gas transmission capacity.
"Gasprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the pipeline was provided to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to get in their way, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pines.
Valves, 4.5 metres high, form the gas outlet door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the coming gas before it is transferred to German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskin, a brand book.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskin wants to restore the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskin notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a off-white color, as aged by time.
Yet, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a notebook of design but distinguished notes.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is based on an old production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton used to cover benches, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travellers.
" Moleskin has restored to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the XXth century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
The success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces.
We are far from the confidential production of the first few years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskin crossed Italian borders and exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to draw up a sketch portrait of the buyer, as the notebook seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, has almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to small shops in the city centre and has been able to impose her identity.
"We followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer covers... The brand is available on a range of supports.
A success that made envious: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the SG Capital Europe investment fund, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people opens today.
Despite a proactive public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the population as a whole.
Disconcerting?
"No," said Eric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled."
" The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable. "
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"However, much remains to be done."
It must be said that for the disabled unemployed, there are still many obstacles to access to employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a diploma and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In short, all these criteria, which make it particularly difficult to return to employment, and which "are the crux of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Managing Director of Tremplin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
That's for the objective brakes.
The unspoken attitude remains, the attitudes that are changing, certainly, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité indicated that the managers interviewed have "a low level of knowledge of the disability", with an "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, psychically or intellectually impaired".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set out in a law of... 1987.
The latest figures from 2008 show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," said Pierre Blanc, managing director of the Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46 000 (from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "Only happiness"
Before confronting the Blues Tuesday night (20:45 pm) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly game gives them.
We won't go so far as to write that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard did indeed make peace.
Five months after the mood of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian breeder has only praise for him.
"I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to move forward," says the Lillois.
As for the contrast between his club and selection performances, "it is a whole, he justified himself."
"In Lille, I'm there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Armed against Romania Friday night in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brillier".
Without, however, omitting the notion of "pleasure".
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a bear," he says.
This necessarily helps to further strengthen the "special" character of this meeting.
Especially as opposite, "there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabay) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"We met earlier."
"To be able to play against them is nothing but happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens, for his part, spoke of "fierty".
"Property" to fight "a gala game."
"Fierté" also finds - as a "neighbourhood" - that France has "become a very high-level team" a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a job of thunder," he said.
As Belgium misses the next Euro, the technician would be well shared with the Blues heading... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are getting tall," he stressed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll find out about it in the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Portugal of Paulo Bento starts with a lot of optimist its barrier back to Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, of which he has been in charge since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to break loose.
In view of the go-0 game, Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, certainly, but it was unable to score this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, but there's a certain risk because we didn't score a goal on the outside."
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as boiling, even if the party obviously promises to be "very tight", a Bento optimistic but lucid.
"We expect a very tight game, but we are quite convinced that we can take over," said the Portuguese coach, 42 years old.
"We continue to have 50% chance of being at Euro 2012", however relativized Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The draw reported on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A zero can be enough for Bosniaks, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we haven't scored a goal on the outside," Bento regrets.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not give them time to think."
A good idea, provided you're realistic this time.
