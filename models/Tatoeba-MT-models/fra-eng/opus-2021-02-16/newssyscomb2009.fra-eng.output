Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current major coalition, as well as a notable strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly serious losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared with the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of the votes, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major parties in the post-war period; especially for the People's Party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the Popular Party had a considerable lead over the SPÖ.
However, the voters visibly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations about the possible resignation of the party leader and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were pronounced.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday, when the extraordinary council of party leadership took place.
Such an evolution would a priori facilitate the way towards the outcome of the election result, which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the great SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
Nevertheless, in view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 per cent and BZÖ 11 per cent of the votes - the socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ separated from it) on a common government, which even raised sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and that he is planning to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently based on this evolution.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell back from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
Obviously, no other party crossed the four per cent limit and did not accede to parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India at Risk of Cooling
If the problem of Czech researchers accused in India of illegal collection of cockroaches could not be resolved, then, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, some cooling of Czech-Indian relations would ensue.
The minister said today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, some cooling would happen," he noted after the meeting, which was carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, on leaving the talks, that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was discharged from the prosecution and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling government, the case being placed under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could ask for bail and wait for the trial at large, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner spoke in the same direction also during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide convicted persons with "competent legal support", the Indian minister mentioned.
He also said that such assistance was already being provided by India.
"We wish above all to keep the best relations with India, which have a tradition going on for many years.
The Indians also recognized him," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We regard the incarceration and the accusation of these Czech researchers as a great contempt," he said.
The minister avoided the question if he had obtained a promise from India to deal with the matter.
"I have already received quite a number of promises," he noted only.
A Czech referee the battle for the sea floor
It is approaching a mural electronic map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seafloor.
However, this area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of thirty members of the United Nations Division for Oceans and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the director of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
Ardour at work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little-known world so far, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources, as well as living organisms that are currently unknown, may contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A wider bottom than the firm ground
The littoral states have begun today to aspire vehemently to the new submarine territories.
According to a UN convention, they are indeed using their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental self, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the Convention, claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental self.
"To simplify, the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea, is considered to be continental itself.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic Yone," explains Mikulka.
The request that the country in question submit to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental self must be supported by extensive scientific-technical documentation, based on numerous prospecting and costly metrisis.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the committee has dealt with five requests, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the time being, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," adds Mikulka.
Australia's success, which was the first to have significantly expanded its underwater possessions, has recently had a global impact.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory — the depth of the seabed, which was allocated to it by the commission last week, is 1.6 million square kilometres, which is the size of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in exploration.
The benefits they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they project themselves, be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will in turn submit their request.
They can do so within ten years after ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental self ends, the zone of the ocean floor begins, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no state has an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by an international institution established by convention.
"Nevertheless, let's not mistake it, the seabed is not a Klondike," says exaggerating Director Mikulka, stating that "its areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Some of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former bloc of Eastern countries within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
It obtained in 1991 under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of the so-called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The investor-prospected area slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is turbulent, it is a sort of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," lists Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, gives an example of such a concretion.
It recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical Shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The German special forces were there for the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had requested Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready but never took action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are revealed.
According to indications from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both federal army specialists and GSG officials 9, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from Technischen Hilfwerk, were at the scene of the release.
As the spokesman for the Ministries communicated on Monday evening, German forces were ultimately not required, the hostage-takers having released their prisoners and having fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government would have accepted Germany's assistance to integrate it locally as a support force.
"Happily this has not happened so far," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers had abducted from southern Egypt the group of tourists made up of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
Following their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transferred to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers has so far remained vague, as have the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have in the meantime arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the freed hostages were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the time being, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five vacationers and the special forces should have taken off on board an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Refuses Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has caused the 700 billion dollar bailout plan to fail.
The Dow Jones fell into the abyss.
With 227 votes against 206, the US House of Representatives rejected the bailout plan for the government's financial markets.
Despite all the calls made by US President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the programme that was to stem the chaos of the financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic move, the parties had desperately tried to convince opponents of the well-founded 700 billion dollar plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called for a favourable vote, although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he conceded.
During the vote, the Dow Jones dropped by more than six per cent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state bailout plan could overwhelm.
He went back a short time before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fell again.
Experts are now projecting serious new turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to come into effect, approval and the House of Deputies and Senate are required.
Organizers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months according to a study, the turnover has increased significantly compared with the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak cyclical prospects, the thirst for German travel remains insatiable according to this study.
With regard to bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period the previous year, as entrusted to Berlin on Monday by the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV).
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing booking figures already dominate the fall months.
Thus the sales figure would have climbed to about 11 per cent in comparison with 2007, confided the RVD.
The sources of these results are the GfK figures, which analyses the bookings data of 1200 travel agencies on a monthly basis and makes estimates for the overall market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low price of the dollar, travel to the US would be particularly requested, said the DRV.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about one third.
Besides this, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be particularly sought after by Germans.
Especially organized trips are very popular, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs here would be "more easily calculable for the customer than for a trip organised individually".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with reductions in advance bookings or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been very successful so that an increase in sales figures will be recorded again compared to last year - although another study has shown that the number of Germans who undertook a trip has decreased compared with the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
Ballermann or Après-Ski hits continuously, beer in pitchers per litre and celebrities in designer Tyrolean costumes.
An event at the beer festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't actually have much in common.
She is blonde, television host and wears a custom-made Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes to the beer festival, and already photographers throw themselves at us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this on my first visit to the beer festival.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to be reaching its goal.
As a beer festival tourist and normally living north of the Weißwurst Equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once in Thérèse Square, everything is half the worse.
Everyone or almost everyone wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; no one seems blasphemed or ashamed - it's completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean costume collects a few odd eye strokes at the banana-shock stand.
A Bavarian woman points out to me that I would have wrongly tied my apron: "left means free, in the middle virgin, to the right squared, to the back widow."
Discreetly, I trip my buckle from the back to the left.
"It's better," she told me and laughed.
Others don't do so much harm for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which is written "Too drunk to get trained!" and exposes their bare back-train to us without being invited.
The young man with an exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, arrives from England and comes for the first time at the beer festival.
He thinks it's "brassy," with a "ooooo" lying down.
He's telling me all this after he's relieved of what he'd been drinking before.
Right next to that fire hydrant that everyone thinks is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild pirates."
Others do not have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, rescuers run in the party square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Instead, nurses work in a pack - always by four - they drag their stretcher covered with tents.
It works this way for most visitors to the beer festival: we go empty, we come back full of it.
Those who lie in the coffin of the stuffed under the tarpaulin are not visible.
"These are the ones who can no longer swallow anything," shouts one of the first aid workers in answer to my question and then disappears in the mix.
Accident victim identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the city's Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later died.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested for suspected dangerous driving.
He's been released since then on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, European powers were eager to enter its hinterland.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps from Asia, is one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what the guides tell us.
The monument is placed on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation towers at each of its corners, like some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as the land more known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding area, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is over.
. The British and the forces of the empire advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turkish and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources state that this is sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, swallowed up in the meanderings of history.
But today, the rail crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serves to underline the widening of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding area, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian fractions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a car-bed in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit MP Turkish AKP Suât Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a journey of 10 and a half hours, shaken on noisy tracks whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived, in the Turkish capital- presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning my back on its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots is an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra modern structure, specifically built of stones and steel, in a developing area, surrounded by half-built shopping centres and numerous pastries in which middle managers in suit-travate- men and women- meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a middle-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"the aim of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey now into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case for both.
She had to do both.
"but, now, at some point, "I asked if" Turkey should not choose?".
"Turkey" he said "does not want to have to choose between the two."
He then stressed an aspect that almost all those with whom I was able to speak, recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway goes not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is, as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe moving metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha train station, after another night without sleeping, I rethought these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been named "the sick of Europe".
At least there is no longer any doubt on the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Musical director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died 11 September) was in charge of Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic choir of young people, Proteus.
The choir had to include the under 21s, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years old- refused to abandon the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any type of music was presented to it, whether it was Madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod told us to "let music speak for itself."
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there, in the music.
So sing!"
His baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be named a knight, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982 when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them has ever disappointed me- and, a few times, they've even inspired me
Tod Handley had such a rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, "focus only on certain people."
He'll miss a lot of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (deceased on September 25) states that "in 1946 he had resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was doing a BSc, an MA, and a PhD."
That's what came from Woodruff's letter in Beyond Nab End, but that's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenca and Life" because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have drawn attention to me because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second assault for Honda's super sales
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
While his predecessor already had a good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
To this is added some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
So it's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz has a very similar line to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them are innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before looking at the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation market.
First of all, Honda has renovated this model in a shorter time frame than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less well known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less than a million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83.000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it expects to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8.000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The managers of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to make up for much of the decline in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand hopes to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, that is to say 4,000 fewer cars than in 2007, a decrease in sales of 16%.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters in length - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year around the world.
Depending on the markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of the Insight's sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimetres more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimetres more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimetres.
On the other hand, the height does not change, i.e. 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and the interior space also.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a gas reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the trunk capacity - which has a double bottom system - can hold up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity than the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L trunk is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to exterior elements such as rear lights or panoramic roof - is improving access to rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, relative to the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2- and 1.4-litre gasoline thrusters.
Both engines have i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine produces 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm torque at 4.900 rpm.
This thruster - which on the previous Jazz was 78 horsepower - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous thruster, which on the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now reaches 100 horsepower.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'Bee Car' which avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan drew on nature, especially bees, this time.
The Japanese company created a robot that, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Centre have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan security shield.
This robot will allow the brand's vehicles to prevent collisions.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that looks much like the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the eyes composed of the bee, able to see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles over a distance of two metres and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"At the moment when it detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by forking its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape manoeuvre is totally instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Transportation Laboratory and senior engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards, nor diagonally; it can move only in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a function of rotation, but also of acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
" Each second this device must only process information and act according to that data.
It does not need to keep the information or intuitive logics of prior maneuvers, that is why it can operate continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes."
This is the first because of the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced into standard cars in ten years after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They're afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be recognized that the United States Treasury, besides having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without geniuses.
Faced with the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from getting into mortgages with credit banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That's to say 'the bad credit hotel' ... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Hotel Master leads us to think several times if this is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
It is sure that this game gives useful information but little detail.
It's more of a teen-only game.
¿What if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the opening of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will pay $9 billion to take 21% of its capital, a news received by a sharp drop in its stock market price.
One week after announcing a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would purchase 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at a unit price of $25.25, for a total amount of $3 billion.
The price chosen is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities that provide it with a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the overall transaction would take place on the basis of an average unit price of $29, or 28% above its current price.
The Morgan Stanley action, however, lost 6.79% at $23.07 around 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding status," said John Mack, general manager of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which is intended to allow him to diversify his activities but to pass it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended in the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago," explained Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, "we thought the participation would be entirely composed of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential shares into common shares if the latter exchange more than 50% above the conversion price, that is to say about 47 dollars, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will enable him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
However, a spokesperson for the group refused to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had "clearly" lightened his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, which has seen its stock exchange price melt by half while the cost of insurance against default risk on its debt was flying away.
This cost was reflected on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced raising $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa to Quito this Monday.
Refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his colleagues and friends, it was the third that put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" received 28%, 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% were white.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out outside the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organisation had announced a large victory of the "yes", between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed the victory of his draft Constitution from Sunday to Monday.
The "Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly," he said, congratulating the Equatorians at the headquarters of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place calmly according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), focused on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the State over the economy, reserving to it the "planning of the development" of a country living essentially from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign currencies sent by its emigrants.
Ported by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants enhanced powers to the Head of State, who will be able to serve up to two consecutive terms of four years and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will be seeking a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services which the President has begun to establish in that country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando attacked the abductors of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back this Monday afternoon safe and sound in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived at about 3.30 p.m. on a special plane at the military base in al-Maza, next to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, aboard helicopters to Maadi Hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examination.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers," said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the tarmac.
Captured on 19 September during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been balked from one cache to the other by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous agency, organiser of the safari.
An Egyptian security official reported that 30 Special Forces personnel, on board two helicopters, had launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of gunshots occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others running away," said the official who demanded anonymity.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "flash" unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men in the secret services, the special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The previous day, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on which the kidnappers were carrying during a patrol, killing in six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is in the headlines and is taking place in this election campaign.
Good.
But one sector of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the amount of misery that is being given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are starving?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to the restoration of the only Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbours, it is written in their country's Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, elected officials and all government departments, in concert.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving with three under piles of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When is a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalise part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Holland bank, as the first European bank in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalising it. The three countries bear a sum of 11.2 billion euros, this financial and insurance institution also having interest in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been growing for more than a year is for Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy back almost half (49%) of the bank's capital in each of the countries.
The bank will, without a doubt, sell part of its holdings, among which, in the first place, the essentially insurance activities it acquired last year from the Dutch body ABN Amro.
Last week, the Fortis shares began a staggering fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too large to let it go to bankruptcy.
On Friday alone, the company's shares dropped by 12 percent, to its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the present value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the company's management, is not realistic.
The company's management is aware of the uncertainty of the overseas Atlantic, in connection with the adoption of the US rescue plan of $700 billion, to be at the origin of the fall of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, there has already been a slight increase in the number of papers.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new general manager.
The financial agency was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the substance.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's client circle and no agency was stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also bought leasing companies.
A fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate on the basis of information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that link the use of prescription information in all cases to the consent of the data subject.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it's like entrusting its henhouse to a fox" - recalled Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage drug prescriptions, at the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the capital insured in case of damage depend on the health condition of the client who presents himself, and if they consider that the risk is too great, they do not even guarantee it.
In the past, they sent the candidates for a medical examination, and they did not sign an insurance contract with them until they became aware of the results.
For the last ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he easily obtains from pharmacies, data concerning the person's drug purchases within the last eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, what disease the person is suffering from and what is his state of health.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts it in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is no longer much to do to the insurer other than paperwork. However, tiny problems may still appear.
Disadvantages of this program include the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of the data, and they must ask the patient for authorisation before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their failure in the past.
Recently, some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory analyses and linking them with data on drug use. In this way, they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and control over use is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the expansion of the control circle of authorities concerning data supply companies is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the data subject.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her consent, since if he or she refuses, the insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
Thus and ultimately, hens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
Marseille's global menu
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other, largely global, problems.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit, which will focus on cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is a major emerging democratic power that should be given a broader voice in international affairs, but member countries have not yet managed to agree on their support in New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not, moreover, dwell too much on this issue yesterday at the 9th summit held in Marseilles.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, like the current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would double trade, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that, between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an overambitious goal.
In this sense, they have harmonized the 26 bilateral agreements with India on civil flights from a legal point of view. In this way, air exchanges can also grow in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, which is the EU's leading trading partner, on the one hand, and New Delhi, on the other, which is only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on this subject has been mentioned.
The completion of the Doha trade round has also been called for, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains committed to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic materials by at least 20 per cent until 2020.
India also agreed on this, as well as with the fact that a global market would have to be reached at next year's climate conference, and that greenhouse gas emissions would have to be reduced by 50 per cent until 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of State is now travelling to the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would cover 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits for this edition, more than 7 miles exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171.790 square meters of the Salon with more than 403 thousand titles in exhibition, and Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Property and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: in fact, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with an Italian Point- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the press meeting in Room Struktur, butterfly 5.0 of Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospectives on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author's books is gradually decreasing in relation to the total Italian production, and in particular in relation to that of adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire missing a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying on the Nevada Desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3000 metres, in the area of the Sierra Nevada of Mammanth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County's sheriff, John Anderson, avoided the doubts that remained: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one Steve Fosset was travelling on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore specified that no human remains were found either on the aircraft or in the vicinity.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Board (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreckage was identified by a team of investigators at the scene, it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on 3 September 2007, when Fosset decave from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal belongings were found by a couple around their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents bearing the name Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
On the sixth attempt, he had become in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had flown around the world without a stopover.
Of all these records, also that of flying at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ad you're not expecting.
An unusual 4x4 of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
This is, in summary, Glk, the latest born off road "compact" of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a wind of novelty in this area.
Precisely because of its off-standard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showroom, starting on October 17.
Thus the advertising battage that will accompany the beginning of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, one will feel that by looking at the image, the self comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Gluk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertisement, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of motorist communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future acquirers? We will see well.
These are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italy" which has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created any big problems.
Nor had it ever clashed with the opposing tifosi.
The extraction of the group is to the right.
The promoters are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (not really) of Campania and Puglia were added.
They had tricolor flags on which their home town appeared: Saturday night, they were all abducted for not being identified.
They are inspired by the English tifoserie.
In Bulgaria, they found a tifosery of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available the Italian tifosi, 144 tickets for the part: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had all controlled them: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian tifosi who had a history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal waits to read the acts that will happen from the Bulgarian police, and then take action: in this case, it may be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the disorder purges a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that forbids to attend Italian, but also European, stadiums.
In short, our hooligans won't get a foothold in the stadium.
Fortunately.
But now it is time for fear-emulation: that is, others risk being added to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must extinguish this fire immediately, and not legitimize that behavior," the Viminal says.
So, "keep your eyes open especially in view of Wednesday's National Team game in Lecce"
In the Puglia there is indeed a small core of supporters of Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets on Tuesday the Casms which can even count on a section of the Aise, i.e. the secret services, which deal precisely with the problems of stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched out during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really not pleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently, director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the post of Francesco Tagliaente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste where resides a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 tifosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the n°1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the Country in which the fact occurs.
So far, this group has remained in the rules, now we will see what has happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles to Mameli's anthem: these too are not crimes, but if you allow me, they are not polite..."
