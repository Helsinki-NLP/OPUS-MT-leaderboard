White pion to f3, black pion to e6, white pion to g4, black lady to h4 - failure and matt! This is what is called by joking in chess circles the "mad's matt".
The whites: turn on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. The blacks: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, crazy on b8. The whites put the opponent in zugzwang by playing the tower in a6, after which the blacks only have two options: take the tower on a6 or move their crazy to any other box of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the whites advance their pawn from b6 to b7 and offer failure and matte. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pawn on a7, with the same result.
