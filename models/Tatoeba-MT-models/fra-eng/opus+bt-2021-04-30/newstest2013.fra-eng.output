A Republican Strategy to Counter Obama's Re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre regards the latter as a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It was in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments enacted new laws from 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon grew after the November 2010 elections, which added 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day and deprive citizens with legal records of their right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of Indiana's law.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have universal identity cards such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID card.
Much more.
Students, voters considered to vote more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID card issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs that vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators sponsored legislation in 2011 abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have dropped the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state's voters.
The same was true with Hispanics.
They accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, the whites who made up 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of the Democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted legislation requiring the submission of a photo ID card.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as an obvious objective of influencing the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes necessary for the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: passing the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes have erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This makes men who are already reluctant to take screening tests even more reluctant.
Are you going to take the test or not?
We sought the advice of two specialists.
In studies in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European study, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that we have between 30 and 40% more chance of having metastases if we are not tested.
So I recommend the test from age 50, or from age 40 if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once we've detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his or her cancer, by offering him or her options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect life in the long term, and by opting instead, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest that they do active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
Increasingly, criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated are being determined with precision.
So I still recommend taking the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with his doctor to determine if we should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the APS test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, the adoption of good lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of harm.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved well enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smokes anymore, this rate would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many also remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Cigarettes are linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
It's very detrimental to people's health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
Weight
Overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease, according to CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity over a lifetime protects against colon cancer," it is added.
Food
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of getting colorectal cancer.
The charcuteries, too, and they should be avoided.
The storage of meat by smoking, drying or salting may result in the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"These can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," it is explained.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research is, however, inconclusive at this time.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to CSC.
While one noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also unclear.
Mr. Beaulieu also emphasizes the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Having a screening test doesn't give you cancer."
The Higgs shelled boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created a great stir last summer, and for good reason.
Indeed, we believe that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that this is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but data is still missing to be absolutely certain.
Let's still assume that it's the Higgs, since the chances of getting wrong seem slim, and let's see what it's about.
There is, in this world, a inevitable law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're gonna hurt yourself.
Even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - that "state" consisting roughly of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner there are good citizens named fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And in the other there are bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, depending on the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not approach here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature spread and to which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosons, it must be pointed out here, are not all as exotic as we might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "messager" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disconcerts" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a bit like a rock thrown into a pond.
From this "disturbation" arises an electromagnetic wave (of light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "force carriers".
Stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, except that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" in order for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you have to reach very, very high energies, a bit like it was a frozen pond whose only a very large rock could ride the surface.
This is why it takes a huge particle accelerator like that of CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and mass.
It is not all particles, nor all materials, that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold on to a fridge.
And in the same way, it is not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, yours) do not.
Now, what can "bring" all this research, Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to examine any discrepancies between observations and predictions of MS.
In fact, there are many who wish to find them, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, proposing no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oops!).
But we haven't found any such discrepancies at CERN so far.
Implications
The impact of this research on the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs. Tout-le-Monde is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
At the very beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratories had no suspicion of the revolution that their work would trigger.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 - initially the laser was seen rather as a "laboratory gadget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from the whole instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his optical work.
This sensor, although it was not his original intention at all, now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras in the world, and earned him the 2009 Nobel in Physics.
This of course does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die...
With its Commission die in dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
Much remains to be done in this crucial area.
The Duty tried to take a closer look at it.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was eating him had given him a two-year rest.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said, half a fig half-raisin, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents it from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Attached in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, talks to strangers who deal around him, bring him his medicine, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is for me to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man is pissing upright," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Regressing to the child's stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to accept regression," he says.
Because, in the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the "team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides so-called "curative" care.
For Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "conscious and suffocated".
But the illness made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in life," she says, before she accepts a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, however, she is waiting for a last visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, body care and food aid were provided with a group of volunteers.
It is palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 people.
It's very little when you know you all end up dying one day.
Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, explains Dr.Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house.
Whether it's physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
If you die, you'll be willing to take care of your mouth with brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served Mr. X a beer, who died during the night.
This morning, her son will finish the beer at the deceased's feet.
"We help loved ones as much as patients," says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow, but they are not alike.
Along with an old 93-year-old man enjoying his last family gathering in the yard, well-stuck in his pillows while being toasted in his honour, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children, after trying everything to survive.
"For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois house arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Access to Palliative Care Problem
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his or her life, whether at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec's health care that causes several palliative care physicians to fear the adoption of legislation governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care leaders such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health care system is not strong enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before they agree to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I've seen a patient spend 14 days in emergency, in great pain, without taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients are only asking to die because they're not receiving proper care.
At the same time, several oncologists are working on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she gave up trying chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I stopped fighting, she said.
But she told me I was done!
Not almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not having responded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Palliative Care at the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, patients would be resistant to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which amounts to falling asleep until the time of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Sick people who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me", it means "I want to be relieved".
This report was made possible through a Canadian Institutes of Health Research Journalism Award.
Large-scale real estate Scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, political party fundraisers and specialists in the Italian mafia recount day after day what they know of a formidable "system", mixing the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
An "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers very much, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has crumbled since we took the big steps," ironically says Jacques Duchesneau, a member of Quebec City's Parliament and former chief of police for Montreal.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive investigation into the misappropriation of road works contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had consented only to step back.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, covert party financing and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the survey in 2010, he points out, the only Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars on the contracts", some restraining their instincts to receive a quota!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he added, hoping that it will manage to "show the schemes behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also working with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Plus the "Marteau Squad" police officers who, since 2009, have allegedly led the "sewer cartel" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the swelling of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and laid charges for fraud and corruption against elected municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly bribed in exchange for public contracts.
There are also formal charges against Montreal road engineers and Italian-born entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the committee the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who donated the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr.Zambito sowed all over the world in the 2000s, giving more than C$88,000 (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the then-in power Liberals.
He also confessed to having organized an illegal fund-raising for the former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts, the costs of which were inflated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption functioned roundly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, detailed it well before the commission: in ten years, he received gift construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totalling $736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs he was inflating.
Other road officials confessed to getting their leg greased by swelling the bills from 30% to 40%, by fake extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget feeding his caisses with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected officials to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, to the east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million to developers, in full boom real estate.
70% dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will eventually be set up, she says that she "draws on a wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin the wrongdoers".
The process, she says, is "painful but positive".
We're cleaning up the wound, but we'd need a Montreal-specific investigation unit and a watch, so we don't have to see suspicious practices come back.
Just like we clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elected people aware of the scheme", when they were not dipping in the scramble!
Estimating 70% of the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he ironically said: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but this will not change the situation, according to him: "As long as election expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He called for a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and party financing: "We cannot go any further; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will make it possible to rebuild the house on a stronger basis, with more controls and laws."
While this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you took on a new dimension with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Every day, I progress by their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements lead me to raise my level of play.
And in the game, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not burning up.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-formation centre to my visit to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced in stages.
So you benefit from the competition set up by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
He is supported by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in League 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with hupped clubs.
He's been with great players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
Then I came out of a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as leader.
But we're still ambushed.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
First of all, we want to finish first in our hen, ahead of Porto, so that we can receive the 8th of the final return.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the long run.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the MTP is building the capacity for this project to materialize.
In League 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to take the title of champion.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a really big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media are expecting too much from PSG?
It's normal to expect a lot of us from what's been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
After that, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and you still find things to blame for, it's sure it's a little frustrating.
We wonder what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we could answer in the presence.
Look at Manchester City who has not been able to qualify for the 8th in the final for two seasons, they have also made huge expenses!
In view of the money invested, we imagined you 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can have a smile by telling ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won.
PSG seems to be totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Good thing we say there's a "Zlatan addiction."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and has a lot of goals.
He came here for this and he proves he's the League 1 star.
He demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He too respects the men he has around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best advocates in the world, also allows everyone to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I was very keen to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grappling with game time.
I saw things there and I got stronger.
Today, I manage to make good matches in selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized with the Blues.
Lessons have been learned from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we must behave exemplaryly.
What look do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of Les Bleus?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifier group for the World.
The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the winner.
Just like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good draw (1-1) torn off on 16 October in Spain a founding game?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never had a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite is true of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between stakeholders.
Moreover, as is often the case in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of peer-to-peer files.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to 2 dollars, five months later, before returning today to around 10 dollars (the prices are recorded on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in this issue in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or can buy (and sometimes trade in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, each time, a central authority controls and processes trade.
With Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are both book of account custodians, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses as an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction into this book.
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and whose winner, a sort of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file hashing phase, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hash" the whole.
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeroes at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to fraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, leaving a margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also met with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The flaw used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also mentions the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Powerful actors like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analysed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of the bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant balances" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, believes much in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but he uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus return cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They just need to communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that thousands of users are there.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to take hold, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, plans to re-evaluate the various risks, which are now considered to be high, if this currency succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for us.
It is above all the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, these will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was in order.
The convoys of trucks and armoured personnel joined Kabul without being attacked, flying over by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban outburst in Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood as a result of struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then seen as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved these days.
Former Mujahedin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmen, seizing government land to sell it to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracts.
They have derided themselves; most of them have not fought themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have been able to benefit from the American vastness will leave: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have joined the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they have appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million people, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who will no longer want to go back to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas that present a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will order it be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, like the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country had been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and much earlier.
No industry has been restarted, no dam is in repair, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
There was widespread noise that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that Westerners were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on site, or means of transport to export it across the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the province's largest employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, will also have to return to normal reporting.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: secondary school for girls, boys, department of French at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and carry out the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a service of "civilo-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has carried out, and had carried out by a small French NGO, numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, which is greedy of local labour, has helped to contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and an increase in cultivable areas.
What will we leave to remember, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa Province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, which the farmers have told me they wish, small, well-controlled and directly affecting civil aid should be maintained for them.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It's a new poker kick from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, it has decided to play its game.
Taking everyone short, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State granted this House an additional two months to complete its work.
Egypt has been relying almost two years on a provisional text, several times amended which undermines institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only deepened the divide in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic deliriousness", continuing to "traitor his word" and "pity the law".
On the side of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible, speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within two weeks.
A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to give up their plans to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, this is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy as the challenge rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since this resort to a hasty vote is due to the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: "Be you voting for my text, either I keep full powers", these are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamic majority, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were missing.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing that they had not been able to present their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society had done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, replacement members, were added in haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it was most often unanimously that the articles were voted on.
Commentators also had fun that only one of the differences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the pendulum of the constituent was not well settled.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
Subject matter of all attention, article 2 remains ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the Liberals reply, who see it as just a communication coup.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
These include article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance of laws with sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the first fruits of a theocracy".
The Liberals' fears are also fuelled by the fact that the next president of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of civil status.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" tempers Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used borrow from religious vocabulary.
Reference is made to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question could arise in the future as to the extent to which civilian judges are competent to rule on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extended powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the former regime.
Another contentious point is the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will trials of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
The latter also expressed their concern about the text, which they considered to be liberticide.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, especially in the press.
In addition, there are no articles that echo the protection of women, says Human Rights Watch's Heba Morayef.
In her view, the only positive development was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was scheduled to speak last night on television, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
The head of state's supporters will march on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the center of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and wilderness.
Argoumenty i Fakty has retained five main reasons to go to Israel.
Go and worship the holy places
Make yourself a must: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who penetrates these "baptismal foundations" will be touched by divine grace.
As for Galilee, it is the earth of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he soothed the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
It was there that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
The believers travel through the Rue de la Souffrance or the Way of the Cross (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the courthouse), where the trial was held, then led by the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the Anointing and the tomb.
This is where the Christian center of the world stands, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to the Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave there small words accompanied by prayers that are then answered.
Travel high
Visit the ruins of Massada Fortress, an ancient refuge from enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 B.C. for his family.
These ruins are on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineers can get there by their own means.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this top full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont, which welcomes many tourists in the winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
Ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to have once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth the detour.
First of all: the Israel Museum located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It houses the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
The paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are mainly exhibited.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of casts of visitors and monitors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures by Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum or Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter in total darkness.
Stars are shimmering.
You then hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
Israel's three major seaside resorts are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each one offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the temperature of the water does not fall below 21° while the temperature of the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The azure-coloured water contains brine and very easily holds the bathers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes surrounding it are of surreal beauty.
We come there to perform a treatment based on salt water, silt, curative sludge and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are guarded by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived here himself a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in the narrow alleyways which bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile on you.
In Jaffa you will be able to meet newlyweds coming to do photoshoots of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre, "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, notably Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you're going to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
With regard to urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturdays.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturdays, markets, shops and public transport stop their activities.
And the workweek starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafés, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, scaly-free fish and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hummus, traditional Jewish dough, various sauces, ground chickpea balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are a lot of well-nourished cats walking around in the haughty air.
We can see them sleeping at night on the roofs of parked cars.
These cats love places that pass by and don't refuse to treat them.
Car rental varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of the numbers
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mostly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists visited Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before visa cancellation on 9 February 2011.
"Who language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists are debating what the law on compulsory language testing will give, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families who stayed at home.
Since 1 December, a law had entered into force and stipulated that every migrant worker would have to pass a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, over time, promises the Federal Migration Service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language, but also of the history of Russia and the foundations of law, will have to be validated.
It will be necessary to validate his language knowledge in Russian in order to obtain and renew his work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Persons who obtained educational certificates or diplomas prior to the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not covered by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Russian-speaking Pushkin Institute, the University of Peoples' Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to take exams in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already asked the question many times in the press: what will it give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service reply, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery at work".
Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the Russian Federal Migration Service office in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
Protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded little house where he and dozens of his fellow men will torment each other for months without food and paper and will have to work between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"There is one thing we promise them, and when they arrive, we deceive them, we take their passports, and they don't get the salary they want," confirms Tolib Charipov, Head of the Directorate of Migration Services for the work of Tajikistan's Migration Service.
Don't argue with me, police officer!
However, many Central Asian nationals who want to come to Russia to earn money say that they do not only know the language of the country where they want to go, but also that they are writing with difficulty in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to attend even fair primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they confide.
"You feel diminished and diminished."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the Language Act.
Examinations will be intended only for migrants with legal status.
Without status, there will be no review or formal work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defense to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then you can get a fake recording quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
Russian police officers know that we have false documents, that we don't have a record, hence the cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, to buy cigarettes, tea," told journalists Umed Khushkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan.
"Quick, don't skimp and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that the registration documents of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The falsified papers come out of an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: each migrant who thus hoped to facilitate the task of the examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Power representatives and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "paper sticks".
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination in the first instance the time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian weapons carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it is the shootings made during the weddings or the killing organised by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven.
The police want to prohibit the wearing of rubber bullet weapons in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a weapons permit from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and the Fight against Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced to the State Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various firing centres, demand to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a recorded weapon is minimal, said Vasiliy Lesnikov, a Russian lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to Ministry of the Interior statistics, over a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from sourcing from the black market .
According to them, any weapon can be found today in Moscow for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, retired colonel who served ten years at the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot from a site taking arms orders
The first is "military trace", that is, weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians," explains Baranets.
The second type of black market weapons is those stolen from law enforcement by criminals.
Baranets explains that they are both weapons stolen from police stocks and weapons stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go for sale from military warehouses.
Many of the latter have often suffered explosions.
"Attested versions indicate that some fires were deliberately triggered to conceal the deficit," the former military officer explains.
For Baranets, the weapons manufacturers were responsible for something.
"We see private weapons factories that do not compete with international competition and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," says one expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A significant proportion of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes craft production, a mafia formed and organizes the supply," adds the former military.
Where did the weapons come from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analysed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, the criminal files and the public data of the weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the army and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found there "by fault of employees whose work is related to weapons," the report explains.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from military conflict sites, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture, and 5% come from "undercover searches".
A seller and consultant of an armory who asked to remain anonymous ensures that for a long time no one buys the weapons found by these clandestine search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, he says, sellers will pick up new goods from military warehouses.
The person buys a unit, such as a TT gun, through a sign.
We deliver it to him by passing the goods through a fence.
"He transports it to town and sells it for 900 € per unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so when crimes are about to be solved, they make a purchase of control from illegal arms dealers," the seller adds.
"As in a luxury shop"
The seller and buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I looked at sites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to the Begovaya station where someone was going to take me in a "corner" to bargain.
The price of the gun, they gave it to me on the spot.
Victor Baranets as Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the salesman. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there you also have to come by saying, for example, "From such a person, who asked me to pass on that his daughter lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with a person I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give it.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former militaryman Victor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, according to him, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
"I thought I was in a luxury store," recalls the military.
There is no secret to the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, we're going with the forest salesman and we're setting up a target.
"I'm allowed to shoot and when I'm convinced that the gun works well, we start negotiating," the expert describes.
A shop from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, there is no need for any documents and no one to meet.
"Just have a specific amount of money," we write in advertising on the website "Buy a gun or a combat machine gun".
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we're selling to the miners?
"Without permit, of course", asks the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of fake sites and shovels people who want to buy combat weapons.
People rush on food like starving wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia

I have heard of this type of scheme: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People are taking the lead.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the "Right to a weapon" association, Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, you can end up unarmed and behind bars.

One Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "Right to a weapon" association, one can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
He was removed from the long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official Ministry data, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes overall decreased in Russia by 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles while the proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
United States: fast food and supermarket employees on strike
Almost a quarter of American teenagers go through cashier work at McDonald's
Over the past few days, a wave of protests has been mounted against the low wages of Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave is going to grow larger or get out of breath quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In addition to the modest wage increases for basic workers at Walmart and in fast food chains, the organisers of the events want to see the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests started last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", at a time when a storm of sales taking hold of millions of people fell on America and sometimes triggering sclanders.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs to organize picket strikes with trade unions and left-wing activists in the company's stores whose products are intended for consumers of the modest and middle classes.
Walmart markets everything from diapers to shotguns, car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
This is why many low-paid employees at Walmart shop only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products especially due to the low salaries of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" protests demanded a salary increase, they complained that the company's medical insurance price had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the base employee at Walmart who gets $9.5 an hour, it's a sum he can't afford.
Scientists at the California University of Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
This is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all wage increases to consumers, each race in the store would be 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12.39 more in one year than they do now.
Walmart supporters are pleased to note that the protests took place in only nine states and did not harm the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in the stores from 8am to midnight the next day and Walmart sold on this period 5000 items per second.
His crates made a total of 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".
The spokesman for the company Dan Fogleman assured in an interview at the left-wing site Huffington Post that in all "less than five" Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a "com' operation among so many" on the part of the organizing union.
"Next customer!"
Protests continued this week in New York City and did not concern Walmart stores (in this progressive city they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet there) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you for the job you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-foods increase over time, but by little, on average, its core employees earn $8.90 an hour in New York.
No one touches less than them in this city.
For me it's inconceivable to live with that money in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum there are comments that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and cooks of fast food be paid at least $15 an hour, a multiplication more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union protesters by bullying or dismissal.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking over fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree.
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the mid-day rally near the McDonald's of Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic policies, including that of Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you for the work you did honestly!".
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, including Mayor Bill De Blasio's candidate who said that "we all need to support fast food workers to get them a fair salary and the economic well-being that each New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the most important event in the fast food industry in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated and not all of them were fast-food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It's hard to say at the moment whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
"At the moment, we only manage to deceive the brain"
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to seeing augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it appears from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Microsoft Cambridge laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for scientists in this society, glasses are already from ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and we are at the same time trying to widen the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has for the time being remained at pixels on a flat screen and sometimes at touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and today almost no Xbox is sold without Kinect because everyone is interested in controlling by gesture.
- What does the future hold for us, too?
- Although the Kinect has made physical interaction, many things happen on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information entry has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance, for the time being, not really.
We're trying to change that and we're working on truly 3D imaging systems that work on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out of ours, into the physical world, to make it more tactile.
To do this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space around it.
Thus, we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overrated?
It cannot be said that this is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of his actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, in order to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought we were doing gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the camera, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can?
You would with the word and the gestures.
- I usually only talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt according to what the machine can or may not do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what don't you like about modern cameras?
They lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, adding work to algorithm designers.
We must keep in mind the resolution according to axes X and Y, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche of our Redmond laboratory gave the sensor touch a steady processing delay of between 1 and 100 μs, with the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need such a device in my job, but not needing to touch, to have more frames in the second.
- But shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define the locations.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around with a smartphone with your hands up is not practical, but here's what I think: the best option would be an augmented reality "transitional" that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch from glasses to smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and this is what makes their strength (the personal elements are the ones you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the augmented reality from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to mere mortals.
There is a problem that opponents of this idea point their finger at: there is no tactile sensation!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
At the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image medium.
She's perfectly recording the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are really meant to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasound rays directed to a precise point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of an air breath on the fingertips.
There are also the bracelets worn on the wrists that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a working axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still one task below on which it will take a long time to struggle: the way to make someone who is physically in a very small space think that he is walking in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we only manage to deceive the brain, there are still many years of work.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "L'avant-garde petersbourgeoise" dedicated to the urban population who are in advance, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the art scene in St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and who have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extroverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that you can meet near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in the trendy parties and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always bring together crowds, no matter where they are displayed.
He is one of the Petresbourgeois storytellers who are fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the petersburg vanguard of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands an organ of Barbary and he became the symbol of this instrument in St.Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role because of his existence, philosophy and image as a Bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you travel the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a tailor specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not grey causes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my work was located.
I realized it was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new ones, free, in my genre, were misunderstood.
I began to be friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina which gave birth to "Puchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds except words.
It was important for me to be at the centre of St. Petersburg culture where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took my place in Pouchkinskaya-10 which housed before the works a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the petersbourgeois bohemian.
Many were born there: The NAMEs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arriving with the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy play-back songs in tight jerseys, they included Igor Vdovin, a fashionable composer today.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg hosted a lot of shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his training and basic education, it was with us that he received them.
Galerie "D137", Club "Griboïedov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees left as regulars.
I'm a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Painter of the Year", and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong topicality and acuity.
I'm going to have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum Through Clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it scares to be like this.
But with clowns, everything disappears, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we have to spit on him.
And the lie will be erased by the disguise.
Recently we've seen you in the role of the organ player of Barbarian.
Who but I can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be treated, delicate, liqueurous.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into herds, bohemians loved one thing, denied another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw away who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come and at the end of the day it's less management, money, everything goes down.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that usually are the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said that there is spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money precisely for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
During the reign of the good tsars, it wasn't like that, the tsars didn't understand culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow today there are good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are out of line, because higher experts are needed who will properly evaluate these experts and pave the way for them.
Currently, it is the "regnate of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find themselves other museums.
- What do you think is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for this.
And on our stones, art has a hard time pushing.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions and concerts.
At home, this layer is very thin.
We have to make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Scholarship
Delivering in space
Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with grounders on board set out to search for a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a great question arises: how can we continue to sustain our species in weightlessness or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that we can conquer, even if only by hypothesis.
"It's about Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, researcher of the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500 .
You can only live there at very high altitudes or on Venus' orbit... in space.
We began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were being carried out on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from earth varieties.
Then, insects, small breeding drosophilic flies, were put into orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to see how an embryo was developing in weightlessness.
At the exit, we get a perfectly normal chick.
It is then that the problems begin.
"The problem is related to the fact that the chick must find a support, he must get on his feet and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By finding no support, the chicks waved disorderly.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
"We shelled their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature arch" with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will only ship species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still about biosatellites and then it's the only experiment. We have to do this kind of research," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions are not yet possible directly in space.
It's a big deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike beasts, man is capable of doing so, in principle.
Homo sapiens possess abstract thought, he is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the female organism is the most precious thing humanity has.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the robbery.
"No one answered this question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadze, retired from the rocket sector and space.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman Svetlana Savitskaya, having been in orbit twice and even working in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts that have had nothing and that give birth to healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it poses a danger even during flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Centre for the Preparation of Cosmonauts: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy, the cosmonauts train at extra-vehicular exits.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults, the water is comfortable but, however, a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
The small amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby moves about 9 months into the lymphatic fluid of his mother's stomach, it is easier to get used to the water.
This is in principle logical, because from his birth until his first bath, it happens only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, the pelvis atrophy very quickly, the ability to push the baby loses.
All right, let's just ignore that by leaning on the birth simulators.
We can of course prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will manage to get him out.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite reflection on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the terrestrial attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or muscle system.
You can't dress an infant like an adult with a special combination for workouts.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely unsuitable," states the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a theory.
However, over time this will become a reality, when the Earthlings travel on their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their space-born offspring.
The head of the ISC (Superior Institution for the Control of Public Finance) said: "the control of pseudo-self-employment (in Czech "Système Švarc") failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and high-quality legislation, but is lagging behind in its implementation.
This was stated by Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Institution in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is lacking in us," Kala said in her comment on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the "Švarc system" by Petr Nečas.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the SDO was not going to bother contractors with controls, so is it allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it forbids something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from acting to inspect from demanding compliance with the law," Kala says.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project in which the public procurement laws of these two countries were compared.
What was it really about?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation, as well as a specific practice.
We have gathered all this together and although this monitoring procedure is not yet complete, we have seen very interesting differences: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "more stringent and of better quality", nevertheless, according to certain parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to draw up ever more detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote itself to the very implementation of the law.
How can this project help you concretely and what does it mean to you?
Common control of this kind should help us stop trying to clarify the laws, lower and improve the thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering the thresholds of the markets will not necessarily achieve this objective.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by red tape that those looking for loopholes will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our SAI or a different way of organizing?
As far as the institutions are concerned, like the SCI, the Bundesrechungshof operates there, which is organised in a similar way, and it also has a council set up a little differently, but these two institutions basically proceed in a similar way .
The powers are also, to a certain extent, similar, however, with a nuance in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has such accounts courts at the level of the various Länder.
The HRB can only control federal money, which in our country corresponds to the resources of the state.
The public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities, are controlled there at the level of the Länder's courts of accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it does better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better detectives?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I don't have any comparative data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we regard as a model, is also facing a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has been meant to you, as an institution, by the amendment of the law on public procurement, are its effects already being felt?
As this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we carry out ex post checks, there is some delay.
Our observations relate only, for the time being, to the process of preparing for future controls - we have launched a new instrument of "detection of the risks of mismanagement" with which we have screened almost 14,000 public contracts - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed and the conditions for certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law to be more of an advantage or an additional burden on the administration?
I believe that this legislation is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm that.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more severe and it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulations, the provider (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced the controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the contract law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal mistakes without affecting the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what's the way out of this?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the SDO was not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it forbids anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from acting to inspect and demand compliance with the law.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and allow it," but he can't say we're going to act as if nothing were going to happen.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder should be eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that, in my opinion, is what is lacking in us.
Roads are frozen in places, but most remain practicable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snow-covered.
However, most of the network remains workable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary area, the roads were practical this morning, but in frozen and also snowy places.
Temperatures have dropped and range from -5 ° to -10 ° C but are expected to rise slightly during the day.
Snowfall has stopped in the area and only a thin layer of snow remains on the plains.
However, the ridges of the Metalliferous Mountains (Krušné hory) are covered by about 30 centimetres of snow.
Data from the regional road maintenance service indicate that fog caused visibility to be reduced in areas.
The R6 expressway and the national roads in the region are now easily accessible.
However, vigilance remains to be exercised, e.g. on certain decks whose surface can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third category lanes, including mountain roads, are also workable.
Remains of frozen snow are still left on some of their sections and in places crowded by traffic.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to increase their vigilance.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové regions
The Directorate of Roads and Motorways reports on its website that some roads in Eastern Bohemia are threatened by ice formation and that layers of traffic-grazed snow can be found on roads in mountainous and high-altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in areas of the Pardubice area at altitude.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoke Mýto, mainly on departmental and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Knónou and Trutnov, a layer of traffic-grabbed snow is present on roads in areas at altitude.
In Eastern Bohemian it will be dry, most often clear today, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will generally oscillate between -3° and +1° C.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are now practicable, although in some places there is a need for greater vigilance and adaptation of driving to weather conditions.
Morning temperatures are around -3 °C and -9 °C. During the day they will rise to a maximum of 8 °C. Low temperatures at night will be around -3 °C. During the day they will reach a maximum of -9 °C.
After the last snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communication routes may be frozen.
Drivers can expect to cross areas of fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is reflected in the information provided by the Regional Road Maintenance Service.
The D5 motorway is almost easy to operate, but road maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 km and 131 km.
The surface of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in South Pilsen District and Tachov District.
The departmental and third category lanes are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers need to be vigilant, especially on the less frequented roads of the Šumava region.
Olomouc region
Drivers travelling to the high-altitude areas of the Olomouc region now have to rely on a thick, soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" pass and on the road towards Videlský k
The snowfalls forced the road maintenance personnel to go to the field this night; according to the road services, it fell more than three centimeters in the Šumperk district.
In other parts of the region, most roads are easily accessible.
" On the heights of the Šumperk district are snow remains.
Drivers travelling towards Jeseník should expect to meet at the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" pass a layer of thick and soft snow," said today to ČTK the head of road maintenance services of the Šumperk district.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also visited the area during the night; according to them, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now cleared and wet, even in the highest areas.
In Olomouc district roads are easily accessible, however in Šternberk district drivers should pay attention in sections in forest areas to roads that remain wet.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, maintenance services on the northern Bohemia roads reported several difficult sections.
Police data show that, in addition to some areas covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, so snow and ice are expected to remain on the roads. In the plains, especially to the southeast of the Central Plateau of Bohème, on the contrary, there are no problems and roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice, particularly in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snowmelt during the day, clear skies and freezing during the night.
From the main traffic routes, there are also reports of difficult conditions on the national road 13 on the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have bent under the weight of snow until reaching the roadway.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
It's just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our band The Tap Tap, we laugh about it and we think that we are the only group able to collect a balance of positive energy in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you set up a very unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project to our readers in more detail?
It is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end almost as soon as the Mayan calendar on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean ends, in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who had that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world we leave to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap band along with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world which is titled "End of the World Cancelled " (in Czech "Konec světa zrušeno").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will we also hear it at these charity concerts?
Of course, everything at the end, at last, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all performers in all three concerts.
The hymns will also join at some point as part of a unique live programme on Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tom+Hanák who also holds the lead role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X sings there as well...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize numerous concerts and charity events...
We strive to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world be for?
To equip the Studeo training centre, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on in the framework of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association, and this for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedličkův Institute and offer them activities that interest and amuse them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Several music groups and performers will be on stage at each of these concerts?
By what criteria did you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, will stage Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustrator with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiů Suchý.
Details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega-events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; here too, we will surely prepare a quality programme with interesting guests.
We'd also like to play next year in the Czech Republic's house in New York and personally, once I'm there in the United States, I'd like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so bad that it looks like it's at first sight.
We have five members in an electric chair whose vehicles must travel in the hold, of course we also carry a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments....
So far everything has gone more or less well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything happened without problems.
With your trips abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of accessibility for people with reduced mobility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that in the east all are still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; it is not yet common for a person to travel alone in an electric chair in the centre of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association is being set up to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities.
How do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to note that improvements and improvements still depend on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, the museum, anywhere...
It is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point you, The Tap Tap, are on the contrary at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and ease of access are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have among us famous sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
For the time being, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this band?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And since I myself am a musician (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator, L.A. Angelovič, says, we lost control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I'm not mistaken?
It's true that creating connections with well-known singers and working actively to promote the band helped us.
We understood that if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to EU grants, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have the goal of reaching such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of stuff that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts for a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I dare to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it's natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take pity on.
They are people who can live a life in their own right and flourish, provided they have the necessary means, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities manage to achieve something, it is not just a step forward for them but for the whole of society.
Isn't your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we are to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require discipline.
But I think it's quite normal.
Some people arrive at our house with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, L.A. Angelovič.
We're an open group, people go in and out, there's nothing we can do about it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case the day before the scheduled end of the world day, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, Brno in Fleda and Ostrava in the Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relay when the band's song The Tap Tap "End of the World Cancelled" is sung together.
The purpose of the concert is to gather financial resources (up to CZK 25 million) to equip the multifunctional training centre Studeo in Prague in the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, the entrance is free for children up to 12 years old, the presale of tickets is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was admitted as a twentieth member of the Agency, as the second member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed participated in a number of the Agency's projects.
The road from Poland to space, however, began much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, A. Šternfeld's conference at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, at which he presented ideas from his avant-garde book "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left the cold listeners and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr.Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his work "Introduction to Astronautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of world-renowned astronautics, his contribution was notably rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the Moon.
As early as 1925, in Poland, a Draisin was built to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
Nor is it clear whether the rocket should be used to propel or brake the draisin.
The only known information about this drain is that of the press of the time.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to devote themselves to rockets.
The research was carried out by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the retained documents that this research had reached the testing stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search stopped.
In 1937, plans for a photoelectric hunting rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all plans to use rocket technology were carried out by the provisional scientific advisory committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war put an end to its activities.
After the war, more work on aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, a company was mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Problème, in which there were four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to astronautics
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research had a future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to join the international Astronautical Federation (created in 1951) and as early as autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the international astronautic federation.
He held office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the weather rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version was constructed, RM-1A, and during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the RM-2 two-stage rocket were initiated in the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket, developed during the period 1962-1965, succeeded the first RM rockets.
This rocket, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they distinguished themselves by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space offering a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C it was 0.62 litres.
The maximum range of all these types of gear was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the Aeronautical Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Poland's entry into the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later are worth mentioning.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this programme.
The repeal of the Public Service Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Service Works Act.
This decision gave rise to a lively public discussion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means in concrete terms that the different economic entities and national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and free (without limits) movement of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour prices (salaries) generate pressure on prices.
This means that a producer tries to resist economic competition by "making the competitor's price more expensive" by importing goods sold cheaply, with the aim of removing a greater share of the market and thus increasing its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, buying at low prices, or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the State's social security contributions are necessarily increasing.
This situation intensifies the complete unwillingness of businessmen to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create a situation in the different economies in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to existing laws.
The aim is to economically force its own population to accept the diktat of private capital prices, particularly in the area of wages.
This is due, on the one hand, to a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, to the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, for years there have been public food distribution points for the poor who cannot support themselves with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the State is forced to pay a supplement to reach the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal has, for example, been brought up to date in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all the Member States of the southern EU are undoubtedly generating a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to live with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
The question here is: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media argue, tired of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the led economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
We must then ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence and, even, does not rule today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same token, the entire state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The evidence is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the drafting of legislation to law firms closely linked to industry.
These bills were then adopted in the Bundestag.
The totality of power does not come from the people, as the Western-style constitutions state, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberalist-oriented democracies are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Times of Caesar and Pompey": "The state had long been in a state of collapse and the functions were attributed to violence.
The bribes, the favours obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The under-tables and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with already sold votes" ... ... "Honest people did not seek any office, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls". ... "It really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man" ... It is true that Appianos had in mind Pompey, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the current society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interest of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and asserting the interests of society as a whole.
The result, today as in the past, is a decadence without precedent from the elites, without any effort to carry out reforms in depth.
We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the present state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracies can be regarded as a sort of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today and the crimes against humanity as we know them from past and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Service Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and internally, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen the state's investment in capital in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of the violence and never will," Sting says in the song Fragile whose main verse of the chorus is "don't forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be none," said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, there have been many reactions.
Some take Israel's side, arguing for its right to self-defence and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its waves of recurrent killings; all in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in this political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a view "behind the curtain", on the one to which mainly benefit the tensions that have already persisted for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others emerge from my own understanding of that, or more precisely of the group of individuals, which is the principal instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At each time, we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individualities acted independently or whether they owed their actions to the throne to someone who directed their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We have to admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration that generates certain powers has not been possible in a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
As early as the 1990s of the 19th century, they acquired the world's first news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts in which they were involved and which had always meant to them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortune or both.
They own major stakes in almost most central banks in the world and prepare or wage wars against countries in which they do not yet have such stakes (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, in the meantime Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew to the Bank of America of the Rothschild the status of central bank and began to issue during the Civil War his own money (government, I hear well) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began issuing clean money and wanted to dissolve the FED, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 as he wanted to initiate a lawsuit against the FED for triggering the Great Economic Crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a freemason initiated in the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The aim of the first war was to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to suppress colonialism, especially British colonialism, and the third was to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and ultimately acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with the Rothschild at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to avoid the recurrence of crises such as those they caused in 1907).
After succeeding in triggering World War I by the assassination in Sarajevo of Habsburg's heir Ferdinand to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers let the politicians create a latent conflict situation: on the one hand they imposed on Germany fierce war reparations thus generating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (it is then enough for them to place a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing at the guilty, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia made up of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who had to play the role (which it actually held) of the fifth column to set fire to the powders and trigger a war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had initially held him; or if everything he did was planned, the fact is that the sufferings of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel lit a fireplace that could cause a third world war.
If the international bankers succeed in starting this war, the Jewish population will be the same as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as will the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people are dividing fiercely between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong leads to another wrong in an endless circle of violence and where we find, at the origin of everything, the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
We must make a difference here between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only propose to people in elections their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything in order to trigger a war with Iran, who, because of his country's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) could expand to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz through which passes 20% of all world oil (this naval corridor is only 2 miles wide) and cause a destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a completely controlled being.
"Let them compel all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to bear on their hands or foreheads a mark with red iron, so that they may neither buy nor sell anyone who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that he who has common sense counts the numbers of this ferocious beast.
This number refers to the man and it's six hundred and sixty-six."
The film Argo: when everything goes to the worst, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who had been supporting his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, a blow further aggravated by the fiasco of the attempted release of the hostages by force.
The sequestered diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate aroused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle strongly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered America a small victory.
Just before she was busy, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated events, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran thanks to a rocky cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who came to make spots for the shooting of a science fiction show film.
Combination of genera
Exfiltration expert Tony Mendez's plan required Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialist magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were held and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation long remained secret, the film being based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistically designed political thriller but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful blow, a treachery - as, for example, in the Ocean's raised, Twelve and Thirteen trilogy.
The atmospheres follow each other: sequences of Tehran in documentary style (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no great differences),
lighter Hollywood passages, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
And then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the hallways and on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting ceased to elicit ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film that does not take place in his home city, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the features that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive by its clarity which also suggests confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake shooting team in Tehran's bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to settle for a subject that actually offered few thrilling scenes, in the cinematic sense of the term.
He does very well, he sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is ruled out by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the airstrip is drawn enough by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in his dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events at too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood coopers, their characters would have earned a bigger place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it allows itself to be seen with moderate interest, enjoying the realization and retro style of the 70s.
He trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of yet another story, in a certain way, unfinished to date, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it does the job.
Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry into the most absurd banking charges, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU has recently planned to adopt a quota of 40 per cent for the management of large European companies has led to our decision," said the newspaper Právo, the organiser of this survey, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, however, women have benefited from life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, less risk to insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013", informed Nacher.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the requirement to add organic components to fuels, which has adverse environmental consequences, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, solely because they contain a relatively small amount of a hazardous substance, or the hen cage size directive, which has led to higher egg prices.
Criticism has also been expressed in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter to spread" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimetres.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of states (for example, the Czech Republic currently imposes the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto power).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, at the root of the fact that bananas in the Union must not be of a size less than 14 cm or have an "abnormal curve".
The European Commission has defended itself by arguing that it is merely harmonising non-homogeneous national standards that complicate trade.
Standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite opposition from some States, claiming that existing directives result in food wastage.
The first prize may be awarded in this investigation to last year's EU regulation that must include a warning on inflatable balloons that children under the age of 8 should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU referred to a U.S. investigation that balloons are the leading cause of child death from suffocation among toys.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when blowing in fair trumpets.
At home, too, we have weird ideas.
The following rule concerning European civil servants themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this topic to Greece, anyone with an official position in the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and instead must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Let Do" of liberal economists, the Bankovnípoplatky.com server named in this survey, in addition to some absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies in the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food supplies that could be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and, as a result, risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found the idea of paying money to certain countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to apply for grants to be granted.
These ideas, however, do not originate in Brussels but in Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea handicaps us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund." In autumn 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) said.
He argued that, as a result of our wheat production, and as a result of so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks that it had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to Czech demand and organised a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for obtaining grants were proposed to municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), and these were to be used, in concrete terms, to draw up applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU states: "Weird regulations are rare".
While the regulations are often criticized in the Member States, many experts believe that the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning and its overall development are more deserving of praise.
More serious, for example, according to experts, is the problem of the use of EU grants for projects which have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which were imposed by the Member States in the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a struggle which it does not always win) arouses strong emotions among Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarрусскийky", as far as the name "Tuzemský rum" which dates back to us in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, not beet sugar, may bear the name rum.
The official list of EU registered products now includes world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, Karlovy Vary's cookies ("Karlovarskésuchary"), Pohořelice and Třeboř ("Pohořelický a Třebořský kapr") and Žatec's hops ("Žatecký chmel").
Pardubice spice bread ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Hořice cornets " ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their Community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Senator, how do we have the idea of running for president?
It's not being a senator or chair that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn't be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer stand to see how the country has been looted for the past twenty years, that thieves are not under lockdown and taxes and the retirement age are rising.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, then I try to come up with a solution to make it change.
And since I am over forty years old and I am independent, a member of no party, I have no other options to influence the situation than to stand in the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but you quickly set off for the Castle (N.d.T.: seat of the Presidency).
Don't you turn your back on those who elected you?
I've always said that I'll start the battle for the Castle according to the results of the senatorial elections.
Later, I said that if I was elected to the Senate, I would run for president.
My purpose is not the function, it is only an instrument for me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we grumble at the bar or in front of our television station, but it is also that we trample on those who try to bring about change.
To this is added the press that breaks people's reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I have been told that I bribe journalists or that I have been the advisor to Jiğ Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You have begun the struggle for the Castle with the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax declarations in excess of twenty million [CZK].
To that end, you must change the law.
As Speaker, you do not have such a power and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I lobbied for tourism guides to be a liberal profession, I won.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, it is deliberately refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to gain the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take from each side what is best for our country and to implement it.
You think you're more like a man on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are putting me on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or a little right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we're moving forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right, but that people are gathered together.
I still support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or the ODS, and I am just as impartially against bad ideas.
Do you get angry when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a business, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have talked about it.
But without the support of Parliament, you only have slogans left.
You won't survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I must convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to rally them to my side in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should eventually explain why they don't want it.
When there is a strong personality who will identify abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the election of the president by direct vote, it was obtained thanks to the pressure of public opinion.
I confess, without a doubt, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I've just started politics and I'm trying to get the support of the majority for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can't make a difference, which is why I went to a number of personalities to ask them to run for the Senate as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed fuel oil fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty per cent of the people did not vote, and most of them gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that will hardly be able to force change.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to form your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I don't have any money for my presidential campaign either, I only have twenty thousand in my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property at about $60 million.
I have in Prague a plot worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid's dream: I always loved James Bond, who drove, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You drive in Aston Martin, you have a wealth worth 60 million and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I've already invested two and a half million dollars in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program does not attract much interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign in my pocket.
My campaign expenses are covered overall by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live on it, for example, paying my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I wouldn't run for election.
So you're going to continue your business activities so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd be mute about your activities?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take over the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I was winning and I keep winning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I'd end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV firm prove that the real adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To be convinced, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, at last something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a large nearby company, tells us: "Yes, it is indeed beautiful, this building".
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one goes to one of these ringuard libraries of their own free will, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that is not attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, has a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore a few neurons to the brains, the city decided a few years ago to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of pretty small miniature painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive has remained limited.
Thus the city authorities realized that there was only one way to regain control over the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from Rotterdam's architect office MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of witty and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and presented himself to the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a squealing on his face.
And while the jury members were still looking at each other, disconcerted and waving their shoulders, Maas, brazen, stacked his books of choice in order of size to make them a pyramid, and ended his speech supported by militant arguments by one: "common love!"
Here it is, my proposal for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the EUR 30 million mountain sprang from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and adjoining houses for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the book mountain received the second "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
In addition, the project was selected for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
Thus, this small, dull village, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a town hall of a staggering uglyness, whose white facades invite to think that they are home to a dairy, has been enriched by a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Of course, an elevator carries you to the heart of the massif, but the true joys of reading and architecture open to you when you walk the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and the elegant lamps speak unequivocally the language of the municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We're already looking at public benches, dogs and little boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books, and more books.
"Normally, library shelves are located along the façade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," says Willy Maas.
We completely changed the classic spatial configuration and opened the spaces for reading from inside to outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been neatly laid out: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental center and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes panelling, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircase ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the hardened building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found in a Frisian agricultural enterprise an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, synthetic membrane with a thickness of one millimetre has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we're saving time.
The fine membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into four centimetres thick plates.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and is transformed into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 metres, the literary café offers stunning views of the city, as well as Dutch croquettes and potted ficus.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain air.
Gifts for the new soul
"It's incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model ecological project," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is controlled by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only illuminates the interior for a short time, even on days of fine weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted across the glass façade serve as a sun visor, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The completely automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already ventured to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig too was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "at last recovered soul".
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure has made it possible to fill the gaps in the library that was not yet fully stocked (today, it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has reached the master discipline that is called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even though she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request for observer State status with the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, without however being too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 insurgency in Libya, Germany had also chosen to abstain in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany have any difficulties in adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy as it were defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore encounter several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that they are still trying to find this role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
What does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for Germans?
It shows the will to adopt positions beyond those of the United States and European partners, including on national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the Middle East conflict and its abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany first has important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to clash with public opinion, but also with the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a determining factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, because it is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a decisive factor in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany harm its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I believe that the fracture is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be even more respected.
Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States has announced its veto with a clear vote.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you observe the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm for Netanyahu's policy.
Is Germany having difficulty reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States with the position of the major European partners?
I don't think it makes things easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
That is what they are currently doing in the question of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will take on a role as a locomotive in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This has always been a delicate issue.
But in my view, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself playing a leading role on the international stage, does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or does it still have difficulty taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make things any easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to deal with a wide variety of neighbours and opinions, and it's not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only diminishing, but at the moment the EU is not filling this void, so who remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're less appreciated, it's life!

"Trademark protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the undertaking bearing its name cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd win the case.
"It's becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer from Taylor Wessing's firm specializing in violating property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators only need a few more letters to register their trademarks.
So instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods.
Pattloch opens a binder in which the registrations made at the Beijing Trademark Office are located.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the trade mark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by owning part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become world champions of copying and infringement of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-story shopping malls that sell virtually nothing but counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his constituents charge him with tackling the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are referred to.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame for.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and legal costs amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to costly flagship products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third largest market for luxury products in the world and the fastest growing market.
However, it is not easy to remove questionable registrations from the trademark registry and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch referred to the lawsuits in which the court dismissed the complaint, as after a long period the criticized name had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains to us that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, because he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, the law of the jungle sometimes dominates.
Famous cases also involve graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against construction machine builder Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump producer Putzmeister.
That's why Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's acquirer, used before a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW's. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost to plagiarists in Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO Beijing Trademark Office admits, however, that it experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office would have moved last year from an "emergency situation in the course of work to a recovered normality".
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings would have fallen by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type were reported to have been closed, an increase of 75% over the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 proceedings remain outstanding at the Office.
It's expensive to act.
As in many cases in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and means that China is for the tenth consecutive time at the top of the ranking for the number of new filings in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office reportedly recorded 1.8 billion yuan of registration fees.
In other words, each recording averaged 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs far more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Of course, the Germans were able to secure the suspension of the illegal manufacture of vehicle components.
However, the copycat was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
"It's our fault, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office had therefore rejected the Munichers' objection.
Freudenberg has certainly won the case in the following two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is in order
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and claims the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "the procedure is long, challenging and it costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The Archives Service has even had to review the proceedings of the past 100 years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg even proposed to the opposing party in vain a "large sum in six-digit euros" to settle the dispute.
"That's what it means to us," Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to spill over to Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region were to ensure the exploitation of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file in Germany the name Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this area, but it had still been able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "vigilance is on the go".
Pattloch and he advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, in their view, to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should rather "register in China everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of recording.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of its legal drama, the company would have to pay license fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or else we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland rejoice at their coming.
This is the story of a link that passes far more than a distance of 8,733 kilometres.
First of all, we tap the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, skirmishes for ladies and moccasins for men look for the rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the vocals of the singers slowly grow - viola, bass, tenor and soprano - they get carried away, bewitch and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he leads the orchestra with his wildly supple gestures.
It's Monday night, the Imbongi choir repeats a new song in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69 have come, from the geneticist in human medicine to the man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy track, each singer has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Being helped to help each other
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This money guarantees the child money for the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "stories storyteller" or "singer of praise".
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this region, but all can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany to now return it to its native region: South Africa.
Because at 8,733 kilometres as the bird flies from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the voice power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of straw or land and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, as HIV has taken away their parents.
In Esitjeni, Swaziland's ailments can be observed on a smaller scale: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population is infected with the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the middle of their thirties.
During a group trip to Africa in spring 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis mostly saw many children on the street who were missing not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
At first, they were only a few people who personally committed themselves to paying a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since been almost professionally caring for Esitjeni's AIDS orphans.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Pubis lice and scabies belong to parasitic STIs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhea often occur in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of every five reported cases of syphilis in Germany are caused by sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are seen in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In addition, in Germany, human papillomavirus is common among young people.
What is the trend in the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one-tenth over the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, and the appearance of buttons and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricant infection or close body contacts.
Experts therefore recommend that any person who often changes sexual partners take regular examinations.
Most rapidly detected STIs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds raised by the singers thanks to their voices throughout Germany, the means are accumulating.
"In all, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well housed, for example in one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, so called the old Zulu women, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them host up to 14 orphans, provide them with a roof and ensure that they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is accommodated in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" established a sewing school and allowed the construction of two hens. With the help of the American health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many residents.
This is not self-evident, because although the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's a subject that touches sexuality."
It is rather curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These State-sanctioned attitudes, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
However, condoms are found on every corner of the street," adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote some cultural exchange, Imbongi's singers travel together every two or three years to South Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still know of during the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in the African language is a sign of recognition such that it not only generates good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears away a few fearful border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godson.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you'll find light there," people say.
And after a trip of 8,733 kilometres as the bird flies, back to Heidelberg, in front of these singers who tap their feet in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 metres thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the specialist journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the planet's region constantly plunged into the shadows.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimetres up to 20 metres.
The water probably comes from comets or maybe from asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one makes a connection between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other life-critical elements have arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Uncovered by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which one observes infinity.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "new-born" in the delivery room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where stars are born, named "W5", a name that is not romantic, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flamboyant glow of a star dying.
The donut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the immense Trifide nebula, at 5,400 light-years from the Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
Pleiades, a cluster of stars also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope enhances the colours.
In this infrared photo, Helice's nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It lies 700 light years away in the constellation Aquarius.
His resemblances to a land continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo allows to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
Depending on the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the nebula of the Trifide in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light years away.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), for three dust drags divide the glowing heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the first fruits of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation of the Serpentary: at 400 million light-years from the Earth, the nuclei of two molten galaxies rush to each other, collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "southern firewheel".
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a detail of the Iris nebula, in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than the common domestic dust.
This photo was developed from optical and radiographic photographs taken by different telescopes.
It shows the circle of black holes that is 430 million light-years from the Earth.
The space telescope photographed this group of galaxies named Arp 273 for NASA.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette nebula, also permanently create young stars 5,000 light years from the Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists think it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was largely composed of hydrogen.
Our look at the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was allegedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have kept growing and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of the Palomar Mountain Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter still reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great ability to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help with the "Search for Extraterrestral Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extra-terrestrial intelligence") by using the computing power of his machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take photographs until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 metres each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory that observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new gigantic telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 metres.
This illustration makes it possible to admire him.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been giving us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
The mission of the telescope will be to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that Mercury's South Pole is also home to ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this theory, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury's North Pole.
Radar data have been showing the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
With the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which one is still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which one is still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The journey through the Talysh Mountains is a complete romanticism.
At the turn of the many turns of the road, the small bus cahotes along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, it's almost like the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group, named Talysh, lives, about which we don't know much, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azeri and that they have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plastrons with its too aggressive Soviet architecture that does not agree at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, as the road has only one lane.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, 48-year-old Pilata Fatulayeva is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva explains.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
We can discover the lives of about eight dozen Talysh of the region who are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
Still having one child at 136 years of age
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when we think that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva says.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a daughter.
Would Şirali Müslümov have been wrong for a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard of man in the early ages of Central Asia.
"Amazingly elderly people also live in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz explains, "in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the lack of documents, and there was no vital register.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
However, it is in fact that people in the Lerik area often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years of age.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem likely, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink daily a glass of melted butter, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, sees Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a barette, whose contents she beats tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, who have long been adults.
Two little children are also swarming in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical armadus glasses in the shape of a belly.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf hide long braids of a dark blond whom his son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and they kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never bought any food in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda is astounding in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who has managed his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, after which his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly people of Azerbaijan are not in distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats (about the same amount as in euros) monthly for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-smooth son is right: "the elders enjoy great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
The “human rights” omitted from the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Opponent demonstrations reveal the deep fracture of the country.
The draft constitution based on sharia is violently controversial.
Egypt's president is not stingy with words full of emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but also for Christian Copts, Liberals, enlightened Muslims and laymen.
Because all members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost by apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its powers "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles written hastily by the predominantly Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour night tour of power are indeed disturbing to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the legal room for manoeuvre that follows to apply a stricter interpretation of sharia law.
In any case, it is suggested by a newly introduced article stipulating that, with regard to all matters relating to Shariah, al-Azhar University must be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance radiates on all the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will supervise the legislative machinery, which would de facto lead to the placing of the judiciary under guardianship.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts worked to suppress opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values", as stated in the draft.
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
In short, it would simply be censorship.
In addition, there are no specific articles guaranteeing equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a cartoon of the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a lawman?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft which Morsi put to the vote and which, in his own words, will be "very soon" the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution Reborn"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down the sharia before it came into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the garbage bins of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi supporters of wanting to foment a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," exclaims Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned," said Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of Cairo University.
The veiled women and the supporters of the Salafists, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean up our country!" they asked Morsi, claiming that "the Qur'an [was their] Constitution".
A fight for sovereignty over the symbolic Tharir Square, where everything began, would soon have led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that opponents of the draft Constitution, along with its supporters, had spoken loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot boxes on the direction the country should take.
The Islamists' project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have lasted until February and encompass all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood while in prison or before the courts under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights were indivisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to all three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto takes away all his powers," Saeda said.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, who looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could be paid for.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway's rakfisk: is it the most fragrant fish in the world?
The five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to local appetite for an extremely fragrant fish?
Have some advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in the water for a duration - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When darkness settles down and it's cold, Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," explains Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter also known as "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people have small pieces of fish and a large amount of drink.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," Havard adds.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it's not bad - it reminds you of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in airtight water barrels and then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - undoubtedly with the senses diminished by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly migrating to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so rich as Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, though fragrant, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to her displeasure.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about "the incident of July 22".
The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country one of them may have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has owed its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the unique reason for our success," explains Anna, our waitress, with her blonde hair and the eyes of a piercing blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk tray in her hand.
We are - how do you say - cautious people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to get noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw money out of the windows, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep its purse cords tight.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Without forgetting the rakfisk," she adds in a carefree laugh.
I stand under the snow and line up to buy something to eat - I got my rakfisk dose.
On the menu, a burger composed of momentum, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I'm staying in is one of many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most fragrant of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a papillon knot, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It's like the Eurovision contest.
"What score did you give the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here's our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of fish fumes.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, the BBC's Will Grant is interested in the challenges ahead and the many expectations of the people.
Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly poor at present.
In a city where traffic jams are rampant in normal times, a safety dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, from the results that we owe to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is plagued by a drug war that has already cost the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. President, Mr. Pena Nieto was Governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populated and tentacular state that surrounds the capital. On its land of choice, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic commune of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in everyone's memory.
The premises attribute it to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the commune.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once humpted and full of cracks.
Plates bearing his name are hung outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to make lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and the party of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economics, in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 unfailing years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects critics of opponents who reproach the new president for lacking charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more obvious.
Hidden under the autoponents of highways, it is, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military was called to the rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious there.
In a disaster zone, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the past two years have been found on the edge of the dump.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place sadly famous for the number of innocent women killed there.
The critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he was unable to contain the problem of murders against women while he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reports a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says the Señora Buendia.
There were signs that it had been beaten, and the cadaveric stiffness was already underway.
While her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross where the word: Justice appears.
However, this is exactly what the family was refused.
The authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want us to accept what they say and shut up.
"But it's not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has made the promise that he will make it his priority during his term.
"I hope he will be as good as he was as a president when he was governor," said Olvera, in Congressman Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, state prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of ill-treatment allegedly suffered by Bradley Manning during detention.
The trial concerns Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to close the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping was carried out under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of causing the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. Army -- missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
In cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein claimed that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a motion requiring that the Manning case be closed on the grounds that the kidnapping took place in very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide while in detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
During Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that the officers had filled out after meeting with Manning, during his detention in Quantico Military Prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment his guards had given him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had received in the prison was overall "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned him about his treatment in prison, Fein said.
Manning responded that he had orally expressed concerns about certain issues and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the issues raised.
"They wrote "no problem" (after addressing the concerns), and yet it did not mean that I had not raised any problems," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during a January 2011 interview with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
Members stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was okay, and I wanted to be removed from my status... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison of the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he considered suicide while in Kuwait and fainted once because of the heat.
He added that not being kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning stated that he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were mattresses, blankets, flip-flops, clothing and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or lying down during the day was contrary to the rules.
Manning also specified that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned around at night, they woke him up so that they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his Thursday testimony -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning, during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning stated that he had inferred from the order of his guard that he should let go of his cover that might have hidden his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to let go of it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the night before, as he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning allegedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or flip-flops to hurt himself, but that he had not done so.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he experienced during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is to be convicted before a court martial, a trial that is expected to take place early next year.
The defense stated that Manning is considering pleading guilty to the least serious crimes and fighting for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to national defence.
If all charges are laid, he is liable to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says that many were forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that Mexico Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, when I arrived in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two routes: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), and another for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stayed still for several seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, where I was called the "Mexican" my whole life.
This is an ethnic qualifier, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish", or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian".
Then I became Mexican-American.
But here it was Mexico.
And, on the earth where my grandfather was born, there is no need for a special qualifier or a hyphen.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to manage an interview in either language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an Aboriginal person, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed for the "Foreigners" line.
I thought about that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favourite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risking themselves in the United States.
He wants to join forces with the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give in writing half of their territory to the tip of the rifle.
But for Mexicans, who reflect in terms of centuries, and no minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints -- in the Mexican press, and among elites -- about how Americans violate their neighbour's sovereignty.
And Montezuma's kids are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want us to talk about bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer opportunities.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a relative or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person matched a typical profile -- dark, poorly educated skin, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we live, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We grant it to the United States.
On the other hand, we know that some of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they kill us as if we were inferior and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
Had our families not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we wouldn't find ourselves stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexico Americans, as Mexicans more firmly claim their identity and Mexico Americans are upset.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels like she's part of two countries.
On the other hand, many Mexican-Americans I know don't feel like they're part of one country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either of them.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexico Americans to work as makeshift ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the pervasive wage inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to take care of yourself, amigos.
That's normal.
While some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican Americans still blame them for the way in which their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there never be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is in vain.
While the same futile arguments persist as to who started, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has shattered everything, and whether we want it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify even further.
Yet there is every reason to believe that this could help them to overcome this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no loser or winner
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Even though the ceasefire granted on 21 November continues, this week's fighting has strengthened supporters of the force on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has been leading Gaza since 2007, will boast of forcing the Israelis to give up, even though Gaza has suffered a beating.
Having killed some of its leaders and turned back the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza to one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the world, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a burgeoning regional power, once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken the stand for Hamas; as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states of the Golf.
Hamas operatives jubilate and say that the Islamicist croissant bends around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where Hizbullah militia exercises its domination, through Syria, where Islamist-led rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And the most important, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders rely more easily on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel's hard line will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been put back in a box.
The so-called Iron Dome missile interception system has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America reiterates its unfailing support; and many European countries have criticized Hamas for being behind the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel flourished, notably under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although rocket fire from Gaza has killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by the suicide bombings, including through the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality under international law.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more belligerent party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the election on 22 January, has the beautiful part.
Why are you pampering these damn Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they headed the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they get their heads out.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will win; but it may be that the Arab Spring will change the situation.
Even if Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere have little appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to arrange their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to secure a ceasefire, which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains that advocated by the reasonable people found on either side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a cession of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give outsiders an opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to stop the circulation of weapons to Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute far more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal for a pseudo-state in the United Nations.
Obama also has an interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term of office, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packages came into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law came into force in Australia is a world first, the logos and colors were replaced by a dark olive green and horrible photos of sick organs and depictions of children and babies whose diseases were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small print on all packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to deter youth from smoking by removing glamour.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said the Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has lobbied against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said this would boost the black market trade, which will make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
"There will be adverse consequences from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre of the British American Tobacco Australia.
Forgers in China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask horrible packaging, has increased sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost to the high court of Australia.
Ha stated that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only trouble, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the segment of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting TV ads, sports sponsorship and the requirement for resellers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and only have a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the must-have place," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some Lambda citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves whether this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has bothered to make a video, or whether this is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulations in place rather than marketing.
Industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries have told the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries regarding similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make warning photos on packaging mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently under consideration in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and put the package away," said Victor El Hage as he bought a package with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna be arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in central Sydney, said the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on displays.
"Before I needed an hour to unload a package, now I need four hours," Yu said.
"The government only had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's okay, we stop and we put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in child development praise boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, even to nourish creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we accommodate the open-armed boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll come back to it.
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The trouble goes back a long way," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, dating back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After going through many publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of "wanting to do something, but not getting into a satisfying activity."
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although he would like it.
With apathy, he says, there's no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of the boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a wretched mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
The boredom can be very much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while both can be related, people who get bored tend to think the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an older experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the next room, the overly loud sound of a TV show that had no connection, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said that they had been more bored than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this concentration problem to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or challenging task, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you perform a boring task, "like watching objects on a montage chain, music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when you twist or scratch, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to giggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay unmoved," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay in my plane flight, a speaker with a monocordous voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Scale of Predisposition to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes assertions such as, "Among the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and in particular need numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blazed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of teens reported bored at school and during homework at home, while 23 per cent reported bored when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 per cent of parents reported bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether today's boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I ask my question, is boredom good for you?
Sometimes no, because in its extreme form, this can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"Badness is the way the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at the N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't have learned to take care of himself or to self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, he gets more mastery of himself in other fields.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant bubbling that activities generate and technology is the goal we should strive for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on that.
"We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frantic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it's hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and a few friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons to appear for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his use - minor offences, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
"We're treated like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is it?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for its personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been classified without further action.
The police have stopped charging adults aged 21 and over for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative ridings have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to charge those who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana sales shops in their neighbourhoods.
"Things are changing so fast that I don't know what the future holds for us," said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora's chief of police, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators also have a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidance on how to install a licensing system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most states in terms of marijuana regulation, first of all in terms of therapeutic use and now in terms of personal use.
" Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith admits, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves," he said.
The Washington Act, known as the I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, during which the permit system will still not exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain: how to balance the state's mandate that guarantees appropriate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the establishment of cannabis sales shops within a 30 km radius of a school, park, playground or crèche.
"There won't be any more difficult places than urban areas to set up a licensed cannabis sales business, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson for the recently formed cannabis legalization centre.
On 21 November, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City Attorney" (representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office) would no longer prosecute people aged 21 and over who own small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop charging people for this type of crime "with immediate effect."
Chief Oates stated that the police would implement the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those cultivating marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, the "district attorney" (Attorney of the Republic), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, mainly in order to pressure users to get detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are charged with other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those persons who committed an offence that, at the time of the incident, was a recognized offence," Buck said.
Reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative to restrict marijuana use.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer summon adults for possession of limited quantities.
The representative of the County Public Prosecutor's Office, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to proceed with all marijuana detention cases.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and government framework for personal marijuana use is not easy.
And the conflicting reactions that have been observed in various American cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with representatives of the Public Prosecutor's Office, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of using marijuana and who speaks as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They spent much of their lives prosecuting people who used marijuana, so they find it hard to accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are in the process of becoming a case law case for the legalization of drugs.
While defenders and government officials are planning a new legalized sales border, they are waiting with concern for the federal government's directives, which still conceives the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Supporters of legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will yield.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients on therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has primarily allowed marijuana sales shops for therapeutic purposes to practice in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police will probably not break into the doors to seize small drug bags, there is a strong bet that they oppose licensed personal-use marijuana sales businesses authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political advisor to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not waited for the federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments have approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales shops, even if it is only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a 6-month moratorium, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find ourselves facing a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mistreated and excluded from Oxford, as I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not only today's students who are being attacked for their opinions.
As far as I remember, I've always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me a prominent place to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after moving to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack up, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were confused.
The newspaper of L'Evening Standard claimed that I had left this university, because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students were having sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson told facetically that I had left after being forced to drink in chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I had been bullied and subjected to constant bullying.
Not because of my rather outspoken name, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for a single reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behaviour: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential counsel to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about it today, you might say.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of center-right students suffer the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week some of them demanded protection of their rights, just like those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Student Hall (JCR) said they were "often isolated, attacked personally and felt undesirable" because of their political views.
They want a representative on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent BBC documentary Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Land of Wonders: Young, Intelligent and Right"), devoted to student politics, which portrayed the "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among other things, the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who travels in Rolls-Royce, wears a silver complete and moves with a chrome-headed cane.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated as scapegoats of implementing the increase in tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper "there is a growing left-wing bias in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, OUCA President, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are center-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one who thought this way in my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and paralysing shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title because of the reduction in funding for graduate studies.
The atmosphere was full of Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students got to know the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen afterwards.
I discovered that teachers not only participated in sarcasms towards Tory students, but also took pleasure in it.
It was as if the policy on strike miners, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were engraved in the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm of which I was a victim concerned a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a small man with a pustulous face, was easily carried away.
"Are the Thatcherists refusing to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons during your free time - at last, if you're not too busy making friends," he threw in a haughty tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and then felt a slight slap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student, named James, who ran as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, nicely.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most young Tory claim to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I loosely tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Ms. Thatcher said.
This scheme has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political and economic science who, ironically, had studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students have taken over the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Would I have only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who shared the same views only after dark?
Should I have become Labour and denied my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who was teaching at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a Conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy advisor to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his adherence to the Marxist-Determinist point of view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started to commute between Oxford and my parents' home in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open-minded urban friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I told him why.
He was unbelieving.
During his studies in Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But this is the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the town with dreaming bell towers.
Even my communist friends had impeccable manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a work session conducted the following week, when another history teacher suggested most seriously in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Inwardly roaring with shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and called them "old fools."
The respite was short-lived.
My father threw the last nail in my oxfordian coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed tapped in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a whiny chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Prime Ministers Tory, but also has an unshakeable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place of British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his sewing house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "he ignores" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there are an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, as well as Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascent: from the modest designer of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jetset.
There's nothing wrong with royalty.
"At least they don't crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet as some pop music stars do," said Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate friend of the beauties of time spent like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charisma of the designer.
Several years ago, after a parade on Spanish Square in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
One could see and feel his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He will never pass from fashion, because his creations are works of art," she concludes.
Scroll of nobility lineage
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He likes well-bred people and with the greatest titles and they love him as well.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre-wide podium that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to march on the podium to admire a dream "public" wearing Valentino's main creations, such as the tailor Jackie Kennedy had chosen for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vetti wore in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Among these models are names such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of her clients say that Valentino's first clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It consisted of trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the couturier's muses.
"I prefer him to all others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimates our beauty," adds Feria's ex-duke.
I very much like the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion designer Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of being old and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward of Line.
It was a red evening dress, with a flying skirt, a draped bustier and a cleavage to fall.
"It was a dream come true," said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the intempore," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the designer's evening dresses with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories she carries".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the designer thus calls his seamstresses) to make this dress in ivory silk with inlays of pearls, twelve different kinds of laces and a drag of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of haute couture of the late 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obnominated for years by the "know-being" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani has as many honours as any spouse of her clients.
"His refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect look have always jumped at me," admits d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, years have no effect on him".
If it's a princess who says so...
The hardest job in the world: Kawah Ijen's human mule
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make their living carrying sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of Indonesia's Java island.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas from the earth's internals solidifies in contact with the air.
After collecting large sulphur rocks, which weigh nearly 70 kilos in total, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through steep paths.
There are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano that peaks at 2,386 meters of altitude, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a tortoise-like pace, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents of euro for each kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once at the top, he makes a way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and painfully carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the scale that a mining company installed a little below at 1,850 meters altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry at 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents), since this ore is very present in everyday life and is used to manufacture candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes him 3 hours and finishes exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is three times what it would gain in the fields.
"The income of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)", states the bearer who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was Rs 75,000 (6.20 euros) a day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned near his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hinduists, and I brought her back to Java to convert to Islam".
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and her eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he spent three of his life defying danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulfur has already begun to charge him the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and her eyes are irritated by toxic gases released by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work for another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in an English more than acceptable.
Maltreated by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares a masure of unsalubrous wood with other carriers, rises daily at two o'clock in the morning as the sulfur does not cease to spring at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater by lighting himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own and are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not receive a sub of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) of increase per camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for beasts, not for humans," protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old full-bodied wearer who has worked in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which of course are added their usual respiratory problems, arthroses, pains in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometres away by a weed-covered goat trail.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says, opening her mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult trades in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans lay responsibility for this lack of children on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"Singapore population needs to grow".
I'm a husband and a patriot, you're my wife and a patriot, let's fulfill our civic duty and let's give life!
It may seem implausible that these lyrics come from an advertisement for mint lozenges, but despite that, or perhaps because of that, the video spread like a drag of powder on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's go put a prank in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill "their national duty".
It is intended solely for the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the area of birth, so we felt that this was a topic that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing pheromones perfumes or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative but did not necessarily work.
So we thought the following thing: what more creative to solve this problem than to make it a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singapore government is not taking it as lightly.
He spends US$1,300 a year on politics to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favour of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, increases maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, in line with its national population distribution, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2, considered to be the turnover rate, was in 1976.
Why, then, do Singaporeans not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, says this is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family formation," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and to delays in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound in barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially against Chinese who are accused of drawing salaries down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons the Singapore-based party experienced its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of the real estate company EL Developers, claims that its "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger housing units.
They are more popular, in the sense that these homes are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash flow.
However, he acknowledged that the new standards gave clearer instructions to proponents, who had previously been put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small housing units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a state city.
While these new regulations may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by discussing with Singaporeans working in the centre's financial district, it would seem that they will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that's why people put it off," says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But for me, it's important to have my money and my time," says another 20-year-old.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons why they cannot have children.
Thus, while the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans themselves have the final say.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from intrusion".
What is the private domain for those under 16 years of age?
How can this definition be applied in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces by broadcasting on the Internet events that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level with "the password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
"I won't reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says ten-year-old Jorge when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I'm talking to my friends, too.
"I won't share one of my pictures or someone who would make the fool," he says.
The boy acknowledges that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge assures that he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are family members.
Her mother is one of them, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk with distant relatives or friends, quickly," he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust someone who would recommend a stranger to him.
José's case, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter he admits not to know 20 of the people registered on his list of friends.
"It doesn't worry me because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the young boy, no one made advances to him or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today as cyber-harassment are no stranger to the young boy.
A relative of one of my friends was racketed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only passed it in private profile".
He then explains a series of manipulations to set up his account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or angry.
"Even though I know it's cyber-harassment," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a bachelor's degree in Education and Learning, considers that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way of looking for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras points out that academician Marc Prensky, who has a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are they, children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves," she says.
He added that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what it is appropriate to disclose, publish or say at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
"Their saying not to do so is useless," she says.
Then Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to publish a picture of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"Outside the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational advisor, said it was essential for parents to read carefully the conditions for using social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to talk to foreigners.
The Unasur Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was announced previously and theoretically adopted by the seven representatives present.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Unasur Heads of State and Government, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be disclosed after the summit closed, and then claimed that it would be published at any time on the Peruvian government's website.
When questioned about the text, they reported that its content had been explained by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to summit information has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, limited audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The lack of information that circulated among journalists was that given by press officers of some of the Unasur governments who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more important information.
Later, Peru's presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the summit's "final declaration", but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South American Arab Summit (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although this was requested by the press, it had also not circulated the statement also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited the gathering of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement between Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court which decided on a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and stated that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleas of both sides in the Lima lawsuit against Santiago which begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are bringing before this international court today," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of controversies, treaties and international tribunals," added President Piñera, giving a handshake to President Humala, next to the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia had denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua which it considered to be gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host President, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The agent read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action for 31 projects had been established between South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to see a better future for our populations," concluded President Humala.
"We decided to favour a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian President said in a speech.
Of these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the transverse axes of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
Similarly, the outcome document referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow it to be reintegrated into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and with good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss the maritime dispute calmly through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua which will ask for a discussion with that country," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will deal with this in the most civilised and respectful way possible," added President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City where they plan to attend the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, in the context of the summit, the bloc's Defence Ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of the Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who attended the sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, TV Péru, that Europeans "had killed each other during World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they were almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still some reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the President of Ecuador has shown his support for the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of diminishing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, but we, the South Americans, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding," he said, referring to Ecuador's political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not betray his principles, but instead respected his "profound democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected".
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish court which demanded that he undergo an interrogation on his territory concerning an alleged sexual offence while "the Swedish legislation allows for this to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa claimed that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a little lung problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health will deteriorate by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"It affects everyone's health," he concludes.
Correa reports that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the award of a safe-conduct that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and he points out that he had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the confinement of WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of proceedings with various European bodies," he mentioned.
And he thinks that "if Britain gave the safe conduct as early as tomorrow, it would end".
And if Sweden, as its legislation quite permits, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and he specified that what he did not tolerate was "the mediocrity, bad faith and lies that hinder freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malevolent or perverse politicians, but the bad journalists who pay for greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed the fact that this was not the kind of journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate in Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality, "this was destroying the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the President of Ecuador considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the Hague International Court, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
They must be solved as a whole to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the successful resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that it was "to the benefit that Latin America should seize the international forums if the two countries agreed to accept a judgment however firm it may be".
Referring to the possibility of his being presented as a candidate for the future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that, if he lost the primarys of February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this eventual victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I will withdraw from political life.
If we ever lose, I will, too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the VIth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed with the HIV test.
"It was as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to inquire about it and his relentlessness was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there was a lot of doubt, little choice of treatment and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was speechless."
In those days, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said HCG's head of the HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he takes as his reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV/AIDS infectiologist and expert, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of immune system allocation of patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those not using drugs: up to 30 years for CD4 levels of 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching 500 CD4 levels.
To put it simply, it means that for someone who would be diagnosed with HIV positive at age 25, "as long as he stays under control, can live without problems up to 75 years," the scientist interviewed explained.
In order to put this progress in context, it is important to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now on average 76 years.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has increased from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients registered on the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
Then why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the past 12 years at least, we've never run out of drugs, the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they don't know they're infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive while they already have an opportunistic infection, what is needed to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to carry out earlier diagnoses and, to do so, we must offer screening tests in a massive way, to all those who request it".
Specialists and members of the Jalisco State Council for AIDS Prevention (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as do patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and despite his young age, he was already carrying AIDS and suffering from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better if I have fun three times a week," they say, "it's not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To date, his parents only know that he is suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILEnio JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of World AIDS Day.
Whether they take the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and the better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, by being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the 2012 battle against AIDS.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest thing is prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "the distribution of condoms has actually been increased, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of one hundred, it is very good, but it results, that still today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, assures the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold at counters, but be found in public toilet dispensers and in places frequented by young people.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had replied when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, the best is to provide condoms to people already sexually active," he stressed.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State is the 4th state of the country in number of new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of infections occur by sexual means, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal means.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV, since for each recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who do not know.
A judgment ratified on appeal by a United States court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario creates a bad precedent for all domestic companies with branching in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
It therefore seems that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the star banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the June 15 judgment of Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenceless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's leading glass manufacturer to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, sitting in New Orleans, states that the main proceeding is formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
Indeed, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been established for that purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by Vitro's subsidiaries towards the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
Here there are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in any case Vitro's creditors who fought against this in the U.S. courts, i.e. "Vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A data omitted by the appellate court.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he had encountered since 2008 without stopping at the serious economic crisis facing the United States, passing on the costs to the country.
For the time being, the González Sada family society will appeal to the same court of appeal to have the vote taken in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance remedy will demand non-prosperity and requires review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
What is more serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") in which Vitro's procedure under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act was detailed, noting that this freed him from the conventions signed by both countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he pointed out that the country had adhered to the United Nations Commission's principles on international trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensured fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carmbling of two parts: they circle Vitro and they circle the country.
General review
The complaints of the Mexican Aviation Society's trade unions against the company's former boss, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were ignored for several months, the latter was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviateurs has already encountered problems.
The body, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just submitted a criminal application against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the F/589 trust of the bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds were allegedly used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Administration of Hotels.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're besieging the Dragon Mart.
Meeting at the end of the week in an amphitheatre of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the South-East zone in order to oppose the monumental project, which is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest of all the threats to the industry.
ACTA's dead.
The government highlighted a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under his English acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already from ancient history.
As everyone knows, this was done well that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
The basketball trotter "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as great as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage condemned him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for over 60 years, whether it was as a lower league player, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I have worn several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball Is My Life".
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs that recall his unusual itinerary, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loved the most were those who reminded him of his career as a player on the Vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
"It was my best years, the ones I took the most advantage of because I had the chance to compete in eight Vaqueros championships starting in 1967, whether as a manager, co-manager or manager.
It's been many years of satisfaction, including the five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired to the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a strong player for you, he's two meters tall.
Do you want it?"
That's how Mincy began, one of Puerto Rico's best players.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another one.
He welcomed the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only remotely since in 1988 he was already the federation's great manito.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's positions on the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the 1989 pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn't had us play the last game again," said Reyes.
Is the 1990 World Team the best national team you've ever seen?
She was one of the best, as was the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was that of the 1991 Cuban Pan American Games, when we won gold and beat the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world 90 due to a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy during the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the suspended players with the imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all prognosis.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Undoubtedly, this is Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level as Piculín did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the various leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that by the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have liked to put in place, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys play only in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island during national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when this is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for managers, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide by the leading role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied an unscrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as an unscrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night from complications of cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for the Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his dear hometown of Dallas, again playing the ironic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who interpreted his wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said his press attaché, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he was living his whole life," Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he had admitted to having been drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was detected with a malignant liver tumor and had a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television in the role of an ordinary type in the series "Jinny de mes rêves" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he performed the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also starred in two comedies that remained short on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in the cinema are roles well received by critics in "The band", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the delightfully detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and their relatives aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Killed J.R.?", invented to maintain suspense around an emotional episode in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the response was revealed in an episode of November 1980, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave town, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man but with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) interned.
"I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write: "Ci-gis the honest citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protothetist of the original series, remembered this Friday of Hagman as a "great man, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us, who have had the chance to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already finished for the second season and a sixth is being made, informed the channel.
For the time being, neither the Warner nor the TNT channel have communicated on how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who knew fame with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the scenes of New York theaters in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': Les mémoires ruthlesses de J.R)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect them in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist concerned patients.
"I advise them, I trust them again, I come with them when they come for surgery and then," he says in 1996.
I'm trying to give them some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it's gonna be okay."
He has also been an anti-tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course on the "End of the World" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion teacher Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching there an irresistible hook: the end of the "great count" of the Maya calendar, on December 21, to which many people refer as proof of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what he expected in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal chasm that some dubbed "the Armageddon of debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the late Christian theorists thought the apocalypse would trigger.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," Professor Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, it was a very good time.
And we must remember that what is evil is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he's not the only teacher to lecture on "the end of the world" this semester, which will be, in theory, the last in history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real-life examples.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply titled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world does not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," said Restall.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," said Restall about its course for high-level students, consisting of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the start of the semester from people who were asking if there was room.
The students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at the University of Rutgers-Camden.
For fear of Revelation, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursing, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a professor, told us that they believed in the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," says Julie zegle, a 21-year-old student at Temple from West Chester.
The Mayas have never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I concede that there is anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back several centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has given rise to speculation.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it," he says.
This is the majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that classes were being given here on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years we have talked about the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he states that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and professors take the date lightly.
Many have told us that they are thinking of going to "end of the world" parties.
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
