As a state where the winner wins everything, Florida awarded Romney its fifty delegates, thus pushing him to the top of the list for the nomination of the Republican party.
The organisers of the event claimed that about 100,000 people appeared in several German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hannover.
In Berlin, police estimate that there were about 6,500 demonstrators.
Demonstrations were also held in Paris, Sofia in Bulgaria, Vilnius in Lithuania, Valletta in Malta, Tallinn in Estonia, and Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.
In London, about 200 people demonstrated in front of the offices of some major copyright owners.
Last month there were major demonstrations in Poland when the country signed ACTA, which decided the Polish government not to ratify the agreement for the time being.
Latvia and Slovakia both delayed the accession process to ACTA.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are once again requesting the mandatory installation of surveillance cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses.
RSPCA Chief Inspector New South Wales David O'Shannessy told ABC that surveillance and inspection of slaughterhouses should be evident in Australia.
"Video surveillance would certainly send a strong message to people working with animals that their well-being is of the utmost importance"
According to data from the International Earthquake Map of the United States Institute of Geological Studies, no earthquake occurred in Iceland during the previous week.
Furthermore, according to the Icelandic meteorological office, the Hekla region has not experienced an earthquake in the last 48 hours.
The major earthquake that led to the phase change occurred on 10 March on the northeast face of the caldera of the summit of the volcano.
Dark clouds unrelated to any volcanic activity were reported at the base of the mountain.
Clouds presented a risk of confusion as to whether a true eruption had occurred.
The Luna had 120–160 cubic metres of fuel on board when it broke down, as the high winds and waves pushed it into the breakwater.
Helicopters rescued the twelve crew members and the only fatal injury was a broken nose.
The 100-metre ship was on its way to retrieve its usual fertilizer cargo, and authorities initially feared it would pour its fuel into the sea.
The proposed amendment was already adopted by both houses in 2011.
A change was made during this legislative session when the second proposal was first deleted by the House of Representatives and then adopted on Monday by the Senate in a similar form.
The failure of the second sentence, which proposes to ban civil unions between persons of the same sex, could eventually open the door to civil unions in the future.
Following this process, the HJR-3 will be reviewed by the next legislative body elected in 2015 or 2016 to remain pending.
Among Vautier's achievements outside the staging stage was a hunger strike in 1973 against what he considered political censorship.
His activism dates back to the age of 15, when he joined the French Resistance during the Second World War.
He did research in a book published in 1998.
In the 1960s, he returned to Algeria, which was recently independent, to teach filmmaking.
Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, winner of two Olympic gold medals, died at the age of 54.
The cause of death was announced as an intrahepatic choledoccal duct cancer.
He died in Osaka on Tuesday.
In addition to being Olympic Champion and World Champion, Saito was president of the Japanese Judo Federation when he died.
At least 100 people attended the party, to celebrate the first anniversary of a couple whose marriage was held last year.
The authorities stated that an official anniversary ceremony had been planned at a later date.
The couple had married in Texas a year ago and had come to Buffalo to celebrate the occasion with friends and relatives.
The 30-year-old Buffalo-born husband was one of the four victims of the killing, but his wife was not injured.
Famous but no less controversial English tutor having taught at Modern Education and King's Glory, Karno claimed to have led 9,000 students at the height of his career.
In his notes, he used words that some parents consider rude, and he would have used swears in class.
Modern Education accused him of having printed major advertisements on buses without permission, and of pretending to be the principal guardian of English.
He was also previously charged with copyright infringement, but was not charged.
A former student claimed that he "used slang in the classroom, taught dredge techniques in writing, and behaved as the student's friend."
Over the past three decades, although China has officially remained a communist state, it has developed a market economy.
The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economic size has multiplied by 90 times.
For the first time, last year, China exported more cars than Germany and surpassed the United States as the largest market for this industry.
China's GDP could exceed that of the United States in the next two decades.
Tropical Storm Danielle, the fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The maximum sustained wind speed of this storm, which occurs approximately 4,800 km from Miami, Florida, is 64 km/h.
Scientists at the National Hurricane Centre predict that Danielle will turn into a hurricane by Wednesday.
Since the storm is far from reaching the coast, it remains difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Born in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, Bobek made himself known by playing for Partizan Belgrade.
He joined him in 1945 and remained there until 1958.
During his time on the team, he scored 403 goals in the space of 468 encounters.
No other player has ever made more appearances or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
In 1995, he was elected the best player in Partizan's history.
The festivities began with a special show by the world-renowned Cirque du Soleil group.
Followed the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a Janissary band, then singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
Then the turning dervishes went on stage.
Turkish diva Sezen Aksu performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
Finally, Turkish dance band Fire of Anatolia presented the show "Troy".
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle driver, died after being involved in an accident on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
During the warm-up lap, Lenz fell off his motorcycle, then was hit by his racing companion Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately taken over by medical personnel on the runway and transported to a local hospital where he subsequently died.
Zayat came out unharmed from the accident.
"As regards the global financial situation, Zapatero went on to say that ""the financial system is part of the economy, an essential element."
We are going through a one-year financial crisis, which has been at its most acute moment in the past two months, and I think now the financial markets are starting to recover."
Last week, Naked News announced its intention to significantly increase the number of hours dedicated to the newspaper in the international language, with three new programs key.
Already present in English and Japanese, the World Organisation launches programmes in Spanish, Italian and Korean for television, web and mobile devices.
Luckily, nothing happened to me, but I saw a macabre scene, where people were trying to break windows in order to get out.
People hit the windows with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
"One of the windows finally broke, and they began to exit through the window," said Franciszek Kowal, a survivor.
The stellar bodies emit light and heat because of the energy created when hydrogen atoms merge (or condense) to create heavier elements.
Scientists are working to create a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
This, however, is a very difficult problem to solve and it will take many years before successful fusion reactors are built.
The steel needle remains submerged due to surface tension.
The surface tension is created because the magnetism between the water molecules on the surface is so much stronger than with the air molecules above them.
The water molecules form an invisible film on the surface that allows objects like the needle to float over the water.
The blade of a modern ice skate is equipped with two ends with a concave hollow between the two. Both ends allow better adherence to the ice, even when tilted.
As the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, when the blade tilts on either side, the edge that is in contact with the ice also bends.
This makes the skater turn. If the skaters lean to the right, the skater turns right, if the skaters lean to the left, the skater turns left.
To return to the previous energy level, they need to get rid of the excess energy stored in contact with the light.
They do so by emitting a tiny particle of light called "photon".
Scientists call this process "stimulated emission of radiation", because atoms are stimulated by bright light, which causes the emission of a photon of light (light being a type of radiation).
The following image shows the atoms that emit photons. Of course in reality the photons are much smaller than those represented on the image.
The photons are even smaller than the particles forming the atoms!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament in the bulb ends up burning and the bulb no longer works.
The bulb must then be replaced. Be careful when changing the bulb.
First, the switch on the lighting device must be switched off or the cable disconnected.
This is due to the fact that the electric current flowing through the socket, where the metal part of the bulb is embedded, can cause severe electric shocks if you come into contact with its interior or metal base while the bulb is still partially inserted into the socket.
The main organ of the cardiovascular system is the heart, which pumpes the blood.
The blood moves away from the heart in tubes called arteries and returns to the heart in tubes called veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
A dentition of triceratops would have been able to crush not only leaves, but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that triceratops ate cycads, a type of plant that was very common during the Cretaceous period.
These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of pointed and bristled leaves.
A triceratops could have used its powerful beak to remove the leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists claim that these plants are very toxic, so it is unlikely that a dinosaur has eaten them, even though today the lazy and other animals like the parrot (a descendant of dinosaurs) can eat toxic leaves or fruits.
If you stood on the surface of Io, you'd weigh less than on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16kg) on Io. So gravity, of course, attracts you less.
The Sun does not have a crust like the Earth on which you can stand. The whole Sun is made of gas, fire and plasma.
The gas becomes scarce as one moves away from the center of the Sun.
The outer part we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means "ball of light".
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo used a telescope to observe that Venus had phases, just like the moon.
Phases occur because only the side of Venus (or the Moon) facing the Sun is illuminated. The phases of Venus have justified Copernicus' theory that planets revolve around the Sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus.
England had experienced a long period of peace after the Danelaw reconquest.
However, in 991, Ethelred had to deal with a Viking fleet larger than all the others since Guthrum's a century earlier.
This fleet was commanded by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian who had the ambition of ousting his country from Danish rule.
After the first military failures, Ethereld managed to reach an agreement with Olaf, for his part returned to Norway in order to try to regain his kingdom, for mixed results.
The Hangeul is the only alphabet invented expressly for use in everyday life. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418 – 1450).
Sejong the Great was the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty and remains one of the most respected Korean rulers.
Originally, he gave the Hangeul alphabet the name of Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "the correct sounds to instruct the people".
There are many theories about how Sanskrit came into being. One of them concerns an Aryan migration from the west to India that came with its language.
Sanskrit is an ancient language, which is comparable to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The oldest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the Upanishads compilation, the Sanskrit simply faded due to the hierarchy
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which has served as a source for many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the source of European languages such as French and Spanish.
Once the battle for France was over, Germany began preparing to invade the island of Great Britain.
Germany gave the code name "Operation Lion of the Sea" to this attack. The British army had lost most of its heavy artillery and ammunition during the evacuation of Dunkirk, and was therefore quite weakened.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could have destroyed any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel.
However, very few Royal Navy ships were based near probable invasion routes as the admirals feared being sunk by a German air attack.
Let's start by explaining Italy's strategy, the main "dauphin" of Germany and Japan.
Their army and fleet were weaker, despite the fact that they built four new ships just before the war began.
The main objectives of Italy were the African countries. To conquer these countries, it was necessary to have a base for launching troops, so that they could cross the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
To do this, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Apart from these actions, the Italian battleships were not supposed to do anything else.
Let us now turn to Japan. Japan is an island country, as is Great Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to travel underwater and stay there for a long time.
The submarines were used during World War I and World War II. At the time, they were very slow and had a very limited range of fire.
At the beginning of the war, they were mainly sailing on the sea, but in view of the progress made in radars, and given their ever-increasing precision, submarines were forced to pass under water in order not to be spotted.
The German submarines were called U-Boot. The Germans were very good at navigating and handling their submarines.
Because of their success with the submarines, after the war the Germans were not trusted to own many.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes called "King All" or "The King Child", is one of the best-known ancient Egyptian monarchs of modern times.
It is interesting to note that it was not considered very important in antiquity and was not listed on most of the ancient lists of kings.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity. While many tombs of the past were looted, this grave remained virtually intact.
Most of the objects buried with Tutankhamon were well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of ray wheels made Assyrian tanks lighter, faster and better prepared to distance soldiers and other tanks.
The arrows of their deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of rival soldiers. Around 1000 B.C., the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
A cavalry is an army that fights on horseback. Since the saddle has not yet been invented, the Assyrian cavalry was fighting on its way up.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists, but the most famous of all this civilization is probably Homer, the blind poet who wrote the two greatest masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems of the Iliad and the Odyssey.
Sophocle and Aristophane are still popular playwrights, and their pieces are considered to be among the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, best known for his famous theorem on the relations of the sides of the rectangle triangles.
Estimates vary as to the number of people who speak Hindi. It is estimated that this is between the second and fourth most commonly spoken language in the world.
The number of mother tongues depends on whether or not very close dialects are taken into account.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers, and up to 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu have a similar vocabulary but a different writing; in a daily conversation, speakers of both languages can generally understand each other.
By the 15th century, northern Estonia had a strong Germanic cultural influence.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the natives; that's why they invented the Estonian literal language.
It was based on the German alphabet and a character "Õ/õ" was added.
Over time, many words borrowed from German have blended. This was the beginning of development.
In tradition, the heir to the throne did his military service after completing his studies.
However, Charles went to university at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later, history, earning a 2:2 (a lower second-class degree).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to obtain a license.
European Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Rumelia on the Balkan Peninsula) comprises 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1600 kilometres (1000 miles) long and 800 kilometres (500 miles) wide, with a more or less rectangular shape.
The area of Turkey, including lakes, is 783,562 square kilometres, including 755,688 square kilometres in South-West Asia and 23,764 square kilometres in Europe.
The size of Turkey makes it the 37th largest country in the world and roughly equals the size of metropolitan France and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is surrounded by seas on three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence dates back only to 1839.
Some present-day regions of Belgium were formerly part of Luxembourg, but became Belgian after the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but the territory was occupied by Germany during the First and Second World Wars.
In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the founding members of the organization today known as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a ruined Buddhist fortress and monastery in the upper part of Paro district (in the village of Phondey).
It is said that in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel created the fortress to commemorate his victory over the Tibetan-Mongolian forces.
In 1951, a fire left only a few relics of the Drukgyal Dzong, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected, remaining one of Bhutan's most sensational attractions.
In the 18th century, Cambodia found itself stuck between two powerful neighbours, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.
In the late 18th century, Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen per cent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those in employment work in the informal economy.
Two thirds of Venezuelans working in the service sector do so, almost one quarter in industry and one fifth in agriculture.
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil, of which the country is a net exporter, even though only one percent works in the oil industry.
In the aftermath of its independence, Singapore acquired expertise in the field of botanical gardens. This island state later turned into a tropical-type garden city.
In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, an orchid hybrid, was chosen as the nation's emblem flower.
Every year, around October, nearly 1.5 million herbivores head for the southern plains, crossing the Mara River, from the northern hills for rains.
And then back to the north by the west, crossing once again the Mara River, after the rains around April.
The Serengeti region includes the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and the Maswa Hunting Reserve in Tanzania, as well as the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools mastered in interactive courses (storyboarding, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to challenge your perception of media production and learn to think in a non-linear way.
Interactive design requires that the elements of a project be linked together, but also that they have meaning as an independent entity.
The lens of the zoom lens has a drawback, because the complexity of the lens and the number of lenses required to obtain a range of focal lengths are far greater than those of the fixed lenses.
This becomes less problematic as manufacturers of lenses meet higher standards in the production of lenses.
This allowed the zooms to produce images of a quality comparable to that obtained by lenses with fixed focal length.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is generally lower.
This makes zoom lenses inexpensively difficult to use in low-light conditions without flash.
One of the most common problems when converting a film to DVD format is overscanning.
Most televisions are made in such a way as to appeal to the general public.
For this reason, everything you see on television has the edges cut up, down and on the sides.
So we have to make sure that the image covers the entire screen. That's what we call the overscan.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, its edges will probably be cut too, and if the video had subtitles too close to the bottom of the screen, they won't appear.
The traditional medieval castle has long stimulated imagination, evoking images of arthurian jousts, banquets and chivalry.
Even in the midst of millennial ruins, it is easy to remember the sounds and smells of distant battles, to hear almost the cliquetis of the hooves on the cobblestones and to feel the fear rising from the dungeon pits.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why have we built castles in the first place? How were they designed and built?
Typical of the time, the castle of Kirby Muxloe belongs more to a fortified house than to a real castle.
Its window windows and thin walls could not have resisted a fierce assault for long.
In the 1480s, when its construction was launched by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful and defence was needed only against small bands of itinerant marauders.
The balance of powers was a system in which European nations sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states.
The idea was that all European nations prevent a nation from becoming powerful, which is why national governments often changed alliances in order to maintain balance.
The Spanish War of Succession marked the First War, the main outcome of which was the balance of power.
This marked a significant change, as the European powers could no longer use the pretext of religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war to be called a religious war.
The Temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 B.C. during arson committed by Herostratus.
According to the story, his motivation was fame at all costs. The Ephesians, outraged, announce that the name of Herostratus will never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo later mentioned this name and this is how it came to us. The temple was destroyed the same night that saw the birth of Alexander the Great.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay to rebuild the temple, but his offer was declined. Later, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.
Make sure your hand is relaxed as much as possible when you play each note correctly. Also try not to make unnecessary movements with your fingers.
You would be less tired in this way. Remember that it is not necessary to overstress the keys to make them sound louder. This is the case on the piano.
With the accordion, to produce more volume, operate the bellows by increasing the pressure or speed of the movements.
Mysticism is the search for communion, for connection with a divinity or a god. It is the full consciousness of a spiritual truth.
The believer seeks a direct experience, intuition or revelation of divine reality/divine or gods.
The followers pursue certain lifestyles, or practices that aim to nourish these experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious worship and belief by its emphasis on the direct personal experience of a single state of consciousness, especially in the case of a peaceful, intuitive, happy, or even ecstatic personality.
Sikhism is a religion of the Indian subcontinent, born in the fifteenth century in the Punjab region, following a schism within the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs regard their faith as a religion distinct from Hinduism, although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their Gurmat religion, which means "the way of the guru" in Punjabi. Guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it has taken on importance that forms the core of Sikh beliefs.
Religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539). Nine other gurus succeeded each other.
However, in June 1956 Khrushchev's promises were put to the test when riots in Poland, where workers protested against food shortages and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against communism.
Although in the end, Kruchev sent tanks to restore order, he ceded to certain economic demands and agreed to name the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indus Valley civilization is a bronze age civilization of the northwest Indian subcontinent, which encompasses most of present-day Pakistan and parts of northwest India and northeast Afghanistan.
This civilization flourished in the basins of the Indus, hence its name.
Some scholars argue, however, that since this civilization was also present in the basins of the Sarasvati River today dried up, it should precisely be called the Indus-Sarasvati civilization, while some name it Harappan civilization after Harappa, the first of its sites to have been discovered, in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire has contributed to the development of medical progress.
Emperor Augustus began recruiting doctors and even trained the first Roman medical corps to treat the victims of the battles.
Surgeons were aware of various sedatives such as morphine, this product derived from poppy seeds, and scopolamine, extracted from seeds of black ass.
They became experts in amputation by saving patients from gangrene, as well as in ligature pliers and arterial pliers used to control blood flow.
Throughout the centuries, the Roman Empire has worked extensively in the field of medicine, and is at the origin of most of the knowledge we possess today.
Origami Pureland is an origami with the constraint that only one fold can be made at a time, more complex folds like inverted folds are not allowed, and all folds have simple locations.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced people or people with limited motor abilities.
Early on, children became aware of race and racial stereotypes, and such stereotypes had an impact on behaviour.
For example, children who identify with a racial minority usually perceived to be inefficient at school tend to fail at school as soon as they discover the stereotype associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website used in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
These websites have generated great interest, especially in the education component.
These sites have beneficial sides, including being able to easily set up page types that include blogs, videos, photos, and other features.
This page is easily accessible from a single web address, making it easy to memorize and write for students who don't know how to use a keyboard and who have spelling problems.
It can be customized to make it easier to read, and you can put as much or as little color as you want.
Attention deficit disorder "is a neurological syndrome whose three characteristic symptoms are impulsivity, difficulty concentrating, and hyperactivity (or excess energy)."
It is not a learning disability; it is a learning disorder that affects 3 to 5% of children and affects nearly 2 million American children.
Children with TDA find it difficult to focus on things such as schoolwork, but they can focus on what they like to do, such as playing games or watching their favorite cartoons or writing sentences without punctuation.
They are children who tend to have significant difficulties, as they "adopt risky behaviours, fight and challenge authority" in order to stimulate their brain, since it cannot be stimulated by normal activities.
TDA affects relationships with other children, who cannot understand why patients act in this way, why they spell as they do, or why their level of maturity is different.
As the ability to acquire knowledge and learn has changed in some way as mentioned above, the basic pace at which knowledge was acquired has changed.
The way information was retrieved was different. There was no longer any pressure on individual memory, but the ability to remember a text became more important.
In short, the Renaissance has led to a major change in the way knowledge is learned and disseminated.
Hominidae no longer use their hands to walk, carry heavy loads or swing from one branch to another from one tree to another like the other primates.
The chimpanzee's hand and foot are similar in size and length, reflecting the use of the hand to carry weight in the locomotion on the joints.
Man's hand is shorter than his foot, with stiffer phalanges.
The bones of the hand of a fossil, two to three million years old, reveal the mutation that has undergone the function of the hand during the transition from locomotion to manipulation.
Some people think that making many lucid dreams artificially caused and quite often can be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of lucid dreams that extend the duration between paradoxical sleep states.
With less paradoxical sleep per night, this state in which you enjoy a real repair sleep becomes rare enough to become problematic.
It's just as exhausting as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes and watching television.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to dream lucidly by night.
Things took a bad turn for the Italians in North Africa almost from the beginning. A week after the declaration of the Italian war on 10 June 1940, the 11th British Hussars seized Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the chief engineer of the tenth Italian army, General Lastucci.
On 28 June, Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor General of Libya and potential successor to Mussolini, was killed by a friendly shot as he landed in Tobruk.
The modern sport of fencing is practised at many levels, from students learning it at the university to professional and Olympic competitions.
This sport mainly takes place in a duel format, with one fencer fighting against another.
Golf is a game in which players use clubs to hit balls and send them into holes.
A game is usually played in eighteen holes: players usually start with the first hole in the course and end with the eighteenth.
The player who takes the least kicks, or swings with the club, to finish the course wins.
The game is played on the grass, and the grass that surrounds the hole is cut shorter and called the "green".
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is that most people associate with the trip: Recreational tourism.
This is the moment when people go to a place, completely different from what they see on a daily basis, to relax and have a good time.
Beaches, theme parks and campgrounds are often the most popular places for leisure tourists.
If the purpose of visiting a particular place is to know its history and culture, this type of tourism is then called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different sites in a given country or choose to focus on a single region.
The colonizers, having spotted this activity, had also called for reinforcements.
Troops reinforcing advanced positions included the 1st and 3rd regiments of 200-man New Hampshire, under Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later became generals).
Stark's men took position along the fence, at the north end of the colon's position.
When the low tide dug a gap along the Mystic River in the northeast of the peninsula, the barrier was quickly enlarged by a stone wall to the north ending at the water's edge on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark placed a stake about 30 metres in front of the fence and ordered that no one shoot before the regulars crossed it.
The American plan was based on the launching of coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder launched a diversion attack on the British garrison in Bordentown, in order to block any reinforcements.
General James Ewing will cross the river to 700 militiamen at Trenton Ferry, seize the bridge over Assunpink Creek, and prevent enemy troops from escaping.
The main assault force, consisting of 2,400 men, crossed the river nine miles north of Trenton, then split into two groups, one under Greene and the other under Sullivan, in order to launch an attack before dawn.
With the transition from 400 meters to 800 meters, the speed becomes much less important and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, an excellent half-bottom runner, a man capable of breaking a two-minute record must have a good speed, but above all a perfectly cultivated endurance.
A little cross-country in winter, combined with room work for the upper body, is the best preparation for the race season.
Good nutrition practices alone are not enough to guarantee elite performance, but they can have a significant impact on the overall well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a good energy balance, proper and regular hydration and good knowledge of the different aspects of nutritional supplements can help athletes improve their performance and make themselves even more enjoyable in their sport.
The half bottom is a relatively inexpensive sport. The idea that it would require basic equipment is as false as most myths surrounding this sport.
Products can be purchased if the need arises, but most will have little or no real impact on the athlete's performance.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product even if it does not bring any real benefit.
The atom can be considered as one of the units that constitutes any matter.
It is a very complex entity which, according to a simplified Bohr model, consists of a central nucleus orbited by electrons, much like the planets orbiting the sun — see illustration 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two particles — neutrons and protons.
The protons have a positive electrical charge while the neutrons have no charge. The electrons have a negative electrical charge.
Before you examine the victim, ensure your safety by inspecting the scene.
You need to notice the victim's position as you approach her and any visible warning signal.
If you hurt yourself trying to help, you'll only make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear, and catastrophism were at the root of the relationship between pain and disability in people with lower back pain.
Only the effects of the disaster, not depression and fear, were conditioned by regular and structured weekly PA sessions.
Those who participate in regular activity need more support in terms of negative perception of pain, distinguishing between chronic pain and discomfort feeling and normal physical movement.
The vision, or the ability to see, depends on the visual system, sensory organs, or eyes.
Eye anatomies vary and are classified in order of complexity according to the requirements of the organism.
The various constructions have different capacities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different degrees of acuity, and require different treatments for the interpretation of the data received and the numbers they need to function optimally also differ.
A population is the set of organisms of a particular species in a given geographic area.
When all individuals in a population are identical with respect to a particular phenotypic trait, they are said to be monomorphic.
When individuals exhibit several variants of a particular trait, they are polymorphic.
The army's ants colonies also walk and nest in different phases.
During the nomadic period, legionary ants walk at night and stop to camp by day.
The colony begins a nomadic phase when the available food has decreased. During this phase, the colony builds temporary nests that are changed daily.
Each of these raids or each of these razzias lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word "cell" comes from the Latin word "cella", which means "small room", and was invented by a microscopist who observed the cork structure.
The cell is the basic unit of all living beings, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
In the study of living, cells are so essential that they are often regarded as the fundamentals of life.
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body to keep the blood flow running as well as undisturbed.
These nerve impulses can be sent very quickly throughout the body, which helps to protect it from any potential threat.
Tornadoes hit a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything in their way.
The tornadoes uproot the trees, tear the planks out of the buildings and throw the cars into the sky. The two percent of the most violent tornadoes last more than three hours.
These giant storms have winds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s or 300 mph).
Man has been making and using lenses for enlargement for thousands and thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were manufactured in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear both larger and closer.
Greed and selfishness will always be part of us. It is natural in a cooperative relationship to win more and faster, by acting selfishly, when the majority is advantaged.
It is hoped that most people will realize that their best long-term option is to work together.
Many dream of the day when we can travel to another star and explore other worlds. For some, it is about knowing what is elsewhere, others believe that aliens or other forms of life could live on another planet.
However, if this were to happen, it would surely not be for a very long time. The stars are so far apart from each other that there are billions of kilometres between so-called nearby stars.
Maybe someday, your great-grandchildren will end up on an alien world, wondering about their distant ancestors?
Animals are made up of many cells. They eat all kinds of things and digest them naturally. Most animals can move.
Only animals have a brain (even if not all animals have one; jellyfish, for example, do not have a brain).
Animals are found all over the earth, digging the ground, swimming in the oceans and flying into the sky.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living organism.
Cell comes from the Latin word cella meaning small piece.
If you look at living things under a microscope, you will see that they are made of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, an English biologist, saw small squares in cork with a microscope.
He was the first to observe dead cells.
Elements and components are able to move from one state to another without changing.
Nitrogen in gaseous form retains the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser, but the molecules remain identical.
Water is another example. Water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure, whether it is a gas, a liquid or a solid.
Although its physical state may vary, its chemical structure remains constant.
Time is something that surrounds us and affects everything we do, and yet it is difficult to understand.
Time has been studied by religious, philosophical and scientific scholars for thousands of years.
We live time as a series of events that go from the future to the past through the present.
Time is also a way to compare the duration (length) of events.
You can mark the time that passes by yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclic event. A cyclic event is something that reproduces regularly.
Nowadays, computers are used to edit photos and videos.
Computers can generate complex animations, increasingly used in television and cinema.
Music is often recorded with sophisticated computers that allow to transform and mix sounds together.
For a long time in the 19th and 20th centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Maori, who hunted giant birds called moas.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia to a Great Fleet and took New Zealand to the Moriori, establishing an agricultural society.
However, new evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of Maori from the mainland who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own distinct and peaceful culture.
There was also another tribe on the Chatham Islands: Maori who had migrated away from New Zealand.
They themselves called themselves the Moriori, and after some clashes, the Moriori were eventually eliminated.
People who have been involved for several decades have helped us understand our strengths and passions while honestly assessing our difficulties and even our failures.
By listening to individuals tell their personal, family and organizational history, we have been able to obtain valuable information about the past and some of the personalities who have positively or negatively influenced the culture of the organization.
While understanding a person's history is not synonymous with understanding his or her culture, it helps people to know at what level they are in the history of the organization.
By assessing successes and recognizing failures, individuals and all participating individuals are more deeply discovering the values, mission, and leadership of the organization.
In this case, remembering the previous examples of entrepreneurial behaviour and the successes that resulted from it helped people to open up to new changes and helped the local church to take a new direction.
Such successes have reduced fears of change, while generating positive trends towards future change.
Converging thought patterns are problem solving techniques that combine different ideas or areas to find a solution.
This state of mind is based on speed, logic and accuracy, but also the identification of facts, the mobilization of pre-existing techniques and the search for information.
The main factor in this state of mind: only one answer is appropriate. You only think of two options: either it's the right answer, or it's a wrong answer.
This type of thinking is associated with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with such thoughts have a logical thinking, are able to memorize patterns, solve problems and work on scientific tests.
Man is by far the most gifted species to read in the thoughts of others.
This means that we are able to anticipate, and not without success, the perceptions, intentions, beliefs, knowledge and desires of other humans.
Among these abilities, it is the ability to understand each other's intentions that matters most, and it allows us to resolve possible ambiguities posed by certain physical actions.
If you saw someone break a car window, for example, you'd probably think he's trying to steal a stranger's car.
He would have to be judged differently if he had lost the keys to his car, and if it was his own car he was trying to force.
MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (of Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves make atoms emit tiny radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a medical doctor and scientist, discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was granted, which was the world's first MRI patent.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first MRI scanner for the entire body, which he called "the Indomitable".
Asynchronous communication promotes time for reflection and reaction to others.
This allows students to work at their own pace while controlling the speed at which teaching information is delivered to them.
In addition, there are fewer time restrictions with the possibility of working with flexible hours. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet allows apprentices to access information as often as they wish.
Students can also submit questions to instructors at any time of the day and expect reasonably quick answers, rather than waiting for the next meeting in person.
Absolute freedom: this is what the post-modern approach to learning offers. There is no good way to learn that would in itself be unique.
In fact, there is not one good thing to learn. Learning is done in the experience between the learner and the presented knowledge.
This point is illustrated by our current experience of all informative television shows on DIY and learning.
So many of us find ourselves watching a television show that shows us a process or experience in which we will never participate or put knowledge into practice.
We're never going to renovate a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to examine ancient ruins, or rebuild our neighbor's house.
Thanks to fibre optic submarine cable connections to Europe and broadband satellite connections, Greenland is well connected and 93% of the population has access to the Internet.
Your hotel, guest house or private residence may offer Wi-Fi or a computer connected to the Internet, while all places have a cybercafé or a place equipped with public Wi-Fi.
As mentioned above, although the word "Esquimau" remains acceptable in the United States, it is considered to be pejorative by many non-American Arctic peoples, particularly in Canada.
Although you can hear native Greenlanders use the word, foreigners must avoid using it.
The Aboriginal inhabitants of Greenland are Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq (pluriel Kalaallit), Greenlanders, Greenland.
"Crimes or acts of malice in general, towards foreigners are not of public knowledge in Greenland. Even in town, there is no "at-risk areas"""
Low temperatures may be the only real danger facing those who are not prepared.
If you visit Greenland during the cold seasons (as you venture north, the cold gets colder), be sure to take warm enough clothes with you.
Long summer days can cause sleep disorders and other health problems associated with sleep disorders.
Also pay attention to northern mosquitoes during the summer. Although they do not transmit any disease, their bite can be irritating.
Tourism occupies an important place in the San Francisco economy due to its international reputation, but in the background, its economic activities are diversified.
The main employment sectors are professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
His frequent performance in music, films, literature and popular culture has helped to make the city and its monuments known around the world.
San Francisco has developed a great tourist infrastructure with many top hotels, restaurants and congress facilities.
San Francisco is also one of the best destinations in the country to discover Asian cuisine: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
The trip to Walt Disney World is an important pilgrimage for many American families.
The "typical" tour consists of flying to Orlando International Airport, busing to a Disney hotel located on the site, staying there for about a week without leaving Disney facilities and returning home.
An infinite amount of variation is possible, but that's what most people hear when they talk about "going to Disney World."
Many tickets sold online at auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are tickets valid in parks for several days but already partially used.
Although this activity is very common, it is forbidden by Disney: tickets are not transferable.
To camp below the Grand Canyon level, you need a backcountry permit.
Permits, issued in limited numbers in order to preserve the canyon, are made available from the first of the month, four months before departure.
For example, a backcountry entry permit for any start date in May becomes valid on January 1.
Places in the most popular places such as the Bright Angel Campground, next to the Phantom Ranch, are usually filled by requests received on the first opening date of reservations.
Permits are limited in number and are reserved for on-site visitors on a first-come, first-served basis.
Entering Southern Africa by car is an incredible way to see all the beauty of the region, as well as to get to places off normal tourist routes.
This can be done in a normal car with careful planning, but a 4x4 is highly recommended and many places are accessible only with a long wheelbase 4x4.
In planning, bear in mind that although southern Africa is stable, not all neighbouring countries are stable.
Visa requirements and related fees vary from country to country, depending on the country you are from.
Each country also has unique laws requiring which first aid products must be in the car.
Victoria Falls is a town in the western part of Zimbabwe, across the border with Livingstone, Zambia, and near Botswana.
The city is located right next to the falls, which are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers adventure lovers as well as tourists many possibilities for a prolonged stay.
During the rainy season (November to March), the volume of water will be higher and the falls will be more dramatic.
You are sure to get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the trails that wind near the falls.
On the other hand, it is good because the volume of water is extremely high that the sight of the falls will be blocked!
The Tomb of Tutankhamon (KV62). KV62 is perhaps the most famous of the valley graves, the place where Howard Carter discovered in 1922 the almost intact royal burial of the young king.
However, compared to most other royal tombs, Tutankhamun's tomb is hardly worth visiting, being much smaller and with limited decoration.
Anyone wishing to see the traces of damage to the mummy during attempts to remove it from the coffin will be disappointed because only the head and shoulders are visible.
The fabulous riches of the tomb are no longer present, but have been transferred to the Egyptian museum in Cairo.
Visitors with limited time would better go elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km from Siem Reap. This temple at the top of a hill was erected at the end of the 9th century, under the reign of King Yasovarman.
The gloomy atmosphere of the temple and the view of Lake Tonlé Sap make the climb to the hill interesting.
The site visit can be pleasantly associated with a boat ride on the lake.
The Angkor pass is mandatory to enter the temple, so don't forget to take your passport by going to Tonlé Sap.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, although most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as such.
The ancient city of the hills of Judea has a fascinating history that spans thousands of years.
The city is holy to the three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam - and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural centre.
The religious importance of the city, and in particular that of the many sites of the old city, makes Jerusalem one of the main tourist destinations in Israel.
Jerusalem has many historic, archaeological and cultural sites as well as busy and busy shopping centres, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador requires Cuban nationals to obtain a letter of recommendation before entering Ecuador through international airports or border crossings.
This letter must be legalized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador and must comply with certain conditions.
These requirements are intended to ensure an organized migration flow between the two countries.
Cuban citizens holding a U.S. green card must go to an Ecuadorian consulate to obtain an exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be valid for at least six months beyond your travel dates. A return ticket is required to prove the duration of your stay.
Visits are cheaper for large groups, so if you are alone or with a single friend, try to meet other people and form a group of four to six people to get a better price per person.
However, this should not worry you too much, as tourists are often mixed to fill cars.
It would seem that this is a way to make people think that they have to pay more.
This steep mountain, which dominates the north end of Machu Picchu, often serves as a backdrop for many photos of the ruins.
This seems a bit intimidating from below, and it's a steep and difficult ascent, but the most fit people should be able to do it in about 45 minutes.
Stone steps are laid along most of the way, and steel cables offer a support ramp in the steepest sections.
That being said, expect to be out of breath and be vigilant in the stiffest portions, especially in case of humidity, because it can very quickly go wrong.
Near the top, you have to cross a small, rather narrow cave with a rather low ceiling.
The best way to see the sites and wildlife of the Galápagos is to take the boat, as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships crisscross the waters of the Galápagos, the size of which varies from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most people reserve their place well in advance (as boats are usually full during the high season).
Make sure that the agent you book with is a Galapagos specialist with a solid knowledge of a wide variety of ships.
This will help find the ship best suited to your specific interests and/or constraints.
Before the arrival of the Spaniards in the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inca rule while the Araucan natives (Mapuche) lived in central and southern Chile.
The Mapuche were also one of the last independent American indigenous groups, which were not fully absorbed by Spanish-speaking domination until after Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared its independence in 1810 (during the Napoleonic wars that left Spain without a central government operational for about two years), the decisive victory over the Spaniards was not achieved until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (República Dominicana in Spanish) is a Caribbean country that occupies the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
Apart from the white sandy beaches and mountain landscapes, the country is home to the oldest European city in the Americas, which are now part of Santo Domingo.
The island was first inhabited by the Taínos and the Caribes. These latter people spoke the Arawakan; it would have happened about ten thousand years B.C.
In just a few years after the arrival of the European explorers, the population of Taino natives had declined considerably as a result of the Spanish conquistadors.
According to Brother Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), between 1492 and 1498, the Spanish conquistadors reportedly killed about 100,000 Taínos.
Jardín de la Unión. This space was built as an atrium of a 17th century convent, of which the Templo de San Diego is the only surviving building.
It now functions as the central square, and there are always a lot of things going on, day and night.
A large number of restaurants can be found around the garden, and free concerts often take place in the afternoon and evening from the central kiosk.
Callejon del Beso (the aisle of the kiss). Two balconies separated by only 69 centimetres house an ancient legend of love.
For a few coins, children will tell you the story.
Bowen Island is a popular day or weekend excursion that offers kayaking, hiking, shops, restaurants, and more.
This authentic community is located on Howe Sound, right next to Vancouver, and is easily accessible by taxi boats that regularly depart from Granville Island, downtown Vancouver.
For those who like outdoor activities, hiking in the Sea to Sky corridor is essential.
Whistler (one-and-a-half hour drive from Vancouver) is expensive, but has made itself known thanks to the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In winter, enjoy some of the best ski slopes in North America and, in summer, enjoy authentic mountain bike rides.
Permits must be reserved in advance. You must have a permit to spend the night at the Sirena.
Sirena is the only forest ranger station that offers dormitory accommodation and hot meals in addition to the campsite. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos offer only camping pitches without catering service.
It is possible to obtain park access permits directly from the Puerto Jiménez Forest Warden Station, but credit cards are not accepted.
The park office (MINAE) does not issue a permit more than one month before the expected arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a booking service for $30, or $10 for a one-day package; find out more on their Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands Archipelago is a state in free association with New Zealand, located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean.
It is an archipelago of 15 islands spread over 2.2 million square kilometres of ocean.
With the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes considered "Hawai of Oceania".
Although smaller, it reminds some elderly visitors of Hawaii Island before it becomes a state with many large tourist hotels and amenities.
No town on the Cook Islands but they are composed of 15 different islands. The main ones are called Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
Today, in developed countries, the offer of luxury guest rooms has been raised to a kind of artistic form.
In the top of the range, the guest rooms obviously compete mainly on two points: bedding and breakfast.
As a result, it is possible to find in the best establishments in this category an extremely luxurious bedding, such as a handmade eiderdon or an antique bed.
Breakfast can include seasonal delights from the region or the host's specialty dish.
The setting could be an old historic building with old furniture, maintained land and a swimming pool.
Climbing in his own car and leaving for a long trip has an intrinsic appeal in its simplicity.
Unlike large vehicles, you are probably already familiar with driving your car and know its limits.
Installing your tent on a private property or in a city, whatever its size, can easily attract attention.
In short, using your car is a great way to make a road trip, but rarely in itself a way to "camp".
Car camping is possible if you have a large minivan, SUV, sedan or break with longer seats.
Some hotels retain their legacy dating back to the golden age of steam trains and transatlantic liners of the 19th and early 20th centuries, before the Second World War.
These hotels were home to the wealthy and famous of the time, and there were regular lavish dinners and superb receptions.
The old-fashioned layout, the lack of recent equipment and a certain old-fashioned charm are also part of their character.
Although most of them are private, some of them sometimes host heads of State or other dignitaries.
Travellers with large sums of money can consider a world tour by plane, interspersed with stays in many of these hotels.
An exchange network of hospitality is the organization that connects travellers with the inhabitants of the cities they will visit.
Joining such a network usually requires only completing an online form; although some networks offer or require further verification.
A list of available hosts is then provided either in print and/or online versions, sometimes with references and reviews from other travellers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 by computer programmer Casey Fenton, who had found a cheap flight to Iceland, but no drop-off point to stay there.
He sent an e-mail to students from the local university and received an impressive number of free accommodation offers.
The hostels are mainly aimed at young people – a typical client at about 20 years old – but there are also often older travelers there.
Families with children are rare, but some hostels accept them in private rooms.
The city of Beijing in China will host the Olympic Winter Games in 2022, making it the first city to host the Summer and Winter Games.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the in-room ice events.
Other ski events will take place in the Taizicheng ski resort in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 feet) from Beijing.
Most temples hold an annual festival that begins in late November and ends in mid-May, which varies according to each one's annual calendar.
Most temple festivals are celebrated as part of the temple's anniversary, the presiding divinity, or at any other major event associated with the temple.
The festivals of the temples of Kerala are very interesting to see, with frequent processions of decorated elephants, the temple orchestra, and other festivities.
An international exhibition (commonly called a universal exhibition or simply an exhibition) is a major international festival of the arts and sciences.
The participating countries organize artistic and educational exhibitions in their national pavilions to highlight the global problems or the culture and history of their country.
International horticultural exhibitions are specialized events that feature floral showcases, botanical gardens and everything about plants.
Although they theoretically can take place every year (provided it is in different countries), in practice this is not the case.
These events normally last between three and six months and take place on sites of at least 50 hectares.
There are many different film formats that have been used over the years. The standard 35 mm film (negative 36 by 24 mm) is by far the most common.
It can usually be replenished fairly easily in case of exhaustion and offers a resolution roughly comparable to that of a current digital SLR.
Some medium-sized cameras use a size of 6 by 6 cm, more precisely a negative of 56 by 56 mm.
This gives a resolution almost four times higher than a negative of 35 mm (3136 mm2 compared to 864).
Wild fauna and flora are among the most difficult themes to capture for a photographer, and require a combination of luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Wildlife photography is often seen as self-evident, but as with photography in general, an image is worth a thousand words.
Photography of wildlife often requires a long telephoto lens. However, other scenes such as a flock of birds or a tiny creature require the use of other lenses.
Many exotic animals are difficult to find, and parks sometimes have rules for taking photos for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be shy or aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or otherwise hostile.
The world has more than 5000 different languages, including about 20 with 50 million speakers or more.
Written words are also often easier to understand than pronounced words. This is particularly true for addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce in an understandable way.
Many nations, as a whole, speak English fluently, and in many other countries partial knowledge can be expected, especially among young people.
Imagine, if you'd like, a Manchester resident, a Boston resident, a Jamaican and a Sydney resident sitting around the same restaurant table in Toronto.
They feast on each other's stories of their native cities, told with their pronounced accents and their local slang.
Buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to eat. Without the possibility of cooking, however, choices are limited to ready-to-use foods.
Supermarkets increasingly offer a more varied range of cooked dishes. Some even provide a microwave oven or other means to warm the food.
In some countries or locations, there is at least one restaurant on site, often quite informal and at affordable prices.
Make copies of your insurance policy and contact details of your insurer and take them with you.
They must submit the insurer's international e-mail address and telephone numbers to obtain advice/authorizations and make claims.
Have another copy available in your luggage and online (e-mail to yourself with attachment, or stored in the "cloud").
If you travel with a laptop or tablet, keep a copy in its memory or disk (accessible offline).
Also give copies of the regulations and contacts to travel companions and family or friends at home who are ready to help you.
The impulses are not of an aggressive nature, but will defend themselves if they feel in danger.
When people don't consider momentum to be potentially dangerous, they can get too close and put themselves at risk.
Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation. Alcohol has different effects on everyone, and it is very important to know its limits.
Possible long-term health problems due to alcoholism include damage to the liver, but also blindness and death. The potential danger is increased if alcohol is consumed illegally.
Illegal spirits may contain various dangerous impurities, including methanol, which can cause blindness or death, even in small doses.
Eyeglasses can cost less abroad, especially in low-income countries with lower labour costs.
Consider having your eyes examined at home, especially if your insurance covers it, and bring back the order that will then be filed elsewhere.
High-end brand frames sold in such parts of the world can present two problems: some may be counterfeits, and truly imported frames may be more expensive than in your country.
Coffee is one of the best-selling goods in the world, and you can probably find many types of coffee in your home area.
Nevertheless, there are many ways to drink coffee around the world that are worth experiencing.
Canyoning (or canyonism) consists of going down a canyon, which is either dry or full of water.
Canyoning combines elements of swimming, climbing and jumping, but requires relatively little training or fitness to start, compared to, for example, climbing, scuba diving or alpine skiing.
Hiking is an outdoor activity that consists of walking in natural environments, often on hiking trails.
A day hike involves distances of less than one mile to longer distances that can be travelled in a single day.
For a one-day hike on an uncomplicated trail, just a few preparations and any relatively healthy person can enjoy it.
Families with young children may need more preparation, but it is possible to spend a day outdoors, even with babies and preschool children.
Internationally, there are nearly 200 running tour organisations, most of which operate independently.
The successor of Global Running Tours, Go Running Tours, networked dozens of tourism jogging service providers on four continents.
Having its roots in Barcelona's Running Tours Barcelona and Copenhagen's Running Copenhagen, it was soon joined by Prague-based Running Tours Prague and others.
There are many things to consider before and while you travel.
When you travel, expect things not to be like "at home." Ways, laws, food, traffic, housing, standards, language, etc. differ to some extent from where you live.
This is something you must always keep in mind to avoid any disappointment or perhaps even aversion to local behavior.
Travel agencies have been in existence since the 19th century. A tour operator is generally a good option for a trip that goes beyond the traveller's previous experiences in terms of nature, culture, language, or low-income country.
Although most agencies are willing to support most regular bookings, many agents specialize in more specific types of travel, price ranges or destinations.
It may be better to use an agent who makes frequent travel arrangements similar to yours.
Take a look at the trips the agent promotes, whether on a website or in a showcase.
If you want to see the world cheaply, by necessity, lifestyle or challenge, there are some ways to do so.
Basically, they can be divided into two categories: either you work during your trip or you try to limit your expenses. This article focuses on the latter category.
For those who are willing to sacrifice comfort, time and predictability to reduce spending to close to zero, check out the minimum budget trip.
These advices are based on the principle that travellers do not steal, enter a public place, participate in the illegal market, beg or exploit others for their benefit.
An immigration checkpoint is usually the first step when you disembark from an aircraft, boat or other vehicle.
On some cross-border trains, inspections are carried out on the running train and you must have valid identification on you when travelling on one of these trains.
In sleeping trains that run at night, passports can be collected by the conductor in order not to interrupt your sleep.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa procedure. In some countries, you must register and indicate the address of your place of stay with the local authorities.
This may require completing a form with the local police or a visit to immigration offices.
In many countries with such a law, local hotels will take care of the registration themselves (don't forget to ask).
In other cases, only persons residing outside tourist accommodation must register. However, the law is much more obscure, so it will be necessary to inquire beforehand.
Architecture refers to the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of a site is often a tourist attraction in its own right.
Many buildings are rather pleasant to look at, and the view offered by large buildings or beautifully placed windows can be of striking beauty.
Other areas of architecture include urban planning, civil engineering, decorative arts, interior decoration and landscaping.
Due to the remoteness of many pueblos, you will not be able to find an important nightlife without going to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the casinos mentioned above serve drinks, and several of them offer high quality entertainment (mainly the large casinos located near Albuquerque and Santa Fe)
Beware: bars in small towns here are not always good places to hang out if you are a foreign visitor.
On the one hand, northern New Mexico has significant drinking problems, and the concentration of drunk drivers is high in the vicinity of bars in small towns.
Wall paintings or unwanted scribbles are known as graffiti.
Although this is far from a modern phenomenon, most people probably associate it with the fact that young people vandalize public and private property using aerosol paint.
Today, however, there are recognized graffiti artists, events devoted to discipline, and "authorized" surfaces to indulge in it. Under these conditions, graffiti are more often like true works of art than vulgar, indecipherable tags.
Boomerang's launch is a popular skill that many tourists want to acquire.
If you want to learn how to launch a boomerang that returns directly to your hand, then make sure you have a boomerang designed to come back.
In reality, most boomerangs available in Australia do not return. It is better for beginners not to try to throw in the wind.
A hangi meal is cooked in a hot pit dug into the ground.
The pit is either heated with hot stones from a fire, or geothermal heat naturally warms some areas of the ground.
Hangi is often used to prepare a traditional roast dinner.
Several places in Rotorua offer geothermal hangis, while other hangis can be sampled in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail offers two classes on suburban trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also called First Class) and Metro (called Third Class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded, but more expensive, while remaining cheaper than the normal fare for metro tickets in Europe.
Each train has Metro and MetroPlus cars; MetroPlus cars are always at the end of the closest train to Cape Town.
Carrying for others – never lose your eye bags, especially when crossing international borders.
Someone could use you to transport drugs without your knowledge, which would get you in big trouble.
This includes online waiting, as drug sniffing dogs can be used at any time without notice.
In some countries, sanctions are extremely draconian, even for the first offences; they can go as far as prison sentences of more than ten years or the death penalty.
Unattended bags are a target for theft and can also attract the attention of authorities who are wary of bomb alerts.
At home, due to this constant exposure to local germs, chances are very high that you are already immune to them.
But in other parts of the world, where bacteriological fauna is new to you, you are more likely to encounter problems.
In addition, in warmer climates, bacteria develop faster and survive longer outside the body.
Thus the plagues of Delhi Belly, the curse of the Pharaoh, the revenge of Montezuma and their many friends.
As with respiratory problems in colder climates, intestinal problems in hot climates are quite common and, in most cases, are particularly embarrassing but not really dangerous.
If you are travelling for the first time in a developing country or in a region of the world you do not know, do not take the possible cultural shock lightly.
Many stable and skilled travellers have been overwhelmed by the novelty of travel to developing countries, where many small cultural adjustments can quickly accumulate.
Especially at the beginning, think about doing crazy things in hotels, food and Western style and quality services to help you acclimate.
Do not sleep on a mattress or cushion on the ground in areas where you do not know the local wildlife.
If you are going camping, bring a camp bed or hammock to stay away from snakes, scorpions and others.
Fill your home with the aroma of an intense coffee in the morning and evening, with that of a relaxing tea with chamomile.
When you are staying, you have time to enjoy yourself and take a few more minutes to prepare something special.
If you feel more adventurous, take the opportunity to prepare a juice or mix smoothies:
Perhaps you will discover a simple drink that you can prepare for your breakfast when you return to your daily routine.
If you live in a city where the culture of drinking is varied, go to the bars or pubs of the neighborhoods you do not frequent.
For those who are not familiar with medical jargon, the words "infectious" and "contagious" have a distinct meaning.
An infectious disease is that caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, bacteria, fungus or other parasites.
A contagious disease is an easily transmissible disease when you are in the vicinity of an infected person.
Many Governments require that visitors entering or leaving their country be vaccinated against a range of diseases.
These requirements may often depend on the countries visited by a traveller, or which he or she intends to visit.
One of Charlotte's strengths in North Carolina is the abundance of high-quality services for families.
Residents from other regions often cite family friendliness as the main reason for their installation, and visitors often find the city easy to enjoy with children nearby.
Over the past 20 years, the number of child-friendly options in Charlotte's business district has grown exponentially.
In general, families do not use taxis in Charlotte, although they may be useful in certain circumstances.
There is a surcharge to have more than two passengers, so this option could be more expensive than necessary.
Antarctica, which surrounds the South Pole, is the coldest place on Earth.
Tourist visits are expensive, require good physical condition, can only take place in summer (November to February) and are largely limited to the peninsula, islands, and Ross Sea.
Some thousands of employees live here in the summer at about 40 bases, mainly in these areas; a small number of them stay in winter.
Interior Antarctica is a desolate plateau covered with 2 to 3 km of ice.
Specific and point-bound air expeditions to the interior, for mountaineering or to reach the Pole, with a vast base.
The South Pole Highway is a 1,600 km highway between McMurdo Station, on the edge of the Ross Sea, and the Pole.
It is compacted snow, with crevices filled and marked by fanions. It can only be traversed by specialized tractors, pulling sleds carrying fuel and supplies.
The latter are not very agile, so the track must make a long stride around the transantarctic mountains to arrive on the plateau.
In winter, the most common cause of accidents is the slippery nature of roads, sidewalks and especially steps.
Shoes with proper soles are the minimum. Summer shoes often slip on ice and snow, even some models planned for the winter do not deviate from them.
The pattern shall be sufficiently deep, 5 mm (1/5 in) or more, and the material shall be sufficiently flexible in cold weather.
Some boots are fitted with crampons and there is additional crampons for slippery conditions, suitable for most shoes and boots, for heels or heels and soles.
The heels must be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) is often dispersed on roads or roads to improve traction.
Avalanches are not abnormal phenomena; steep slopes can retain only a small amount of snow, the excess of which spreads in the form of avalanches.
The problem is that the snow sticks, so if it collapses, there was a trigger. However, a slight collapse of the snow can be the trigger for everything else.
Sometimes the trigger is solar warming on the snow, sometimes it's just more snow, and other times it can be natural events or human activity.
A tornado is a column-shaped low-pressure air vortex, the surrounding air is sucked inwards and upwards.
They generate strong winds (often from 100 to 200 miles/hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, carrying them as the tornado moves.
They begin as funnels descending from stormy clouds, and become "tornades" when they touch earth.
Personal VPN providers (virtual private network) are an excellent way to bypass both political censorship and commercial IP geofiltering.
They are superior to web proxy for several reasons: they redirect all online traffic, not just the http.
They normally offer greater bandwidth and better quality of service. They are encrypted and therefore harder to spy on.
Media companies commonly lie about the purpose of this measure, claiming that it aims to "prevent piracy".
In fact, regional codes have absolutely no effect on illegal copying; a bit-to-bit copy of a disk works very well on any device where the original can be played.
The real goal is to give these companies greater control over their markets; it's about making money.
As calls are made via the Internet, you do not need to use a telephone company located where you live or travel.
It is also not mandatory to get a local number from the community you live in; you can get a satellite Internet connection in the wilderness of Chicken, Alaska, and select a number that indicates that you are in sunny Arizona.
Often, you need to buy an international number that allows calls in RCTP. The location where your phone number is located is crucial for people who call you.
Real-time translation applications are apps that can automatically translate whole segments of text from one language to another.
Some of the applications in this category can even translate texts into a foreign language written on panels or other everyday objects when the user points his smartphone to them.
Translation engines have improved considerably, and now often give translations more or less correct (and more rarely gibberish), but you have to be careful, because they may still have everything wrong.
One of the most famous applications in this category is Google Translate, which allows you to translate offline after downloading the desired language data.
The use of GPS navigation apps on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to travel outside your country of residence.
It can save money by buying new maps for a GPS or autonomous GPS device, or by renting one from a car rental company.
If you do not have a data connection on your phone, or if it is out of reach, its performance may be limited or unavailable.
Each store in the corner is filled with a confusing array of prepaid phone cards that can be used from pay phones or regular phones.
While most cards allow calling everywhere, some are specialized in offering advantageous rates for specific groups of countries.
Access to these services is often provided through a free phone number that can be called toll-free from almost all telephones.
The rules on regular photography also apply to video recording, or even more.
If it is forbidden to take a simple photo of something, you should not even think about recording a video of it.
If you are using a drone, check in advance what you are allowed to film and what additional permits or licences are required.
Flying a drone near an airport or above a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it is not illegal in your area.
Nowadays, it is rare for people to book their flights directly via the airline without first looking for and comparing prices.
The same flight may sometimes have wide price differences between aggregators; before booking, it is therefore advantageous to compare the results of the searches as well as to consult the website of the airline itself.
If you do not need a visa for short stays in some countries as a tourist or for business travel, going there as a foreign student usually requires a longer stay than that of a simple tourist.
In general, to stay in a foreign country for a long period of time, you must obtain a visa in advance.
Application procedures and student visa requirements are generally different from those of standard tourism or business visas.
For most countries, you will need a letter of acceptance from the institution in which you wish to study, as well as proof of sufficient funds to support you at least during the first year of your course.
For details of the conditions, see the institution as well as the immigration service of the country in which you wish to study.
Unless you are a diplomat, working abroad usually means that you will have to complete the income tax return in the country where you are based.
Income tax is structured differently in different countries, and tax rates and tax brackets vary widely from country to country.
In some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is levied at both the federal and local levels, so tax rates and brackets can vary from region to region.
While immigration control is generally absent or a formality upon arrival in your country of origin, customs control can be a source of hassle.
Make sure you know what you can and can't bring, and declare everything that goes beyond legal limits.
The easiest way to get involved in writing travel articles is to improve on a well-established travel blog.
After, and only after you have mastered online formatting and revision, you will be able to create your own website.
Volunteering on travel is a great way to make a difference, but it's not just about giving.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to discover a different culture, meet new people, get to know yourself, get new perspectives and even new skills.
It can also be a good way to stretch a budget to allow a longer stay somewhere, as many volunteer jobs offer lodging and cover and some pay a small salary.
Vikings have used Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Some parts of these routes can still be used. Check the possible need for special permits, which may be difficult to obtain.
The White Sea Canal connects the Arctic Ocean with the Baltic Sea, via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and St. Petersburg, mainly passing through rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga, so it is still possible to come from the Caspian Sea through Russia.
Rest assured: once you reach the marinas, everything will be clear. You will meet other auto-stoppers, who will share their information with you.
Basically, you will display ads to offer your help, survey the docks, approach people cleaning their yachts, try to get acquainted with browsers at the bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will know you and give you hints on the boat looking for someone.
You must carefully choose your Frequent Flyer airline as part of an alliance.
Even if you think it is intuitive to join the airline with which you travel the most, you should know that the privileges offered are often different and that the loyalty point system may be more generous with another airline of the same alliance.
Airlines such as Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have greatly expanded their offerings in Africa, offering routes to major African cities at competitive rates compared to other European airlines.
In 2014, Turkish Airlines served 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have more time to travel, compare the total price of the ticket to Africa with the price of a ticket to tour the world.
Don't forget to add additional visa fees, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc. for all these places outside Africa.
If you want to fly around the world only in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations will be limited because of the lack of transoceanic routes.
There is no airline alliance covering the junctions of the three southern hemisphere oceans (and SkyTeam does not cover any of them).
However, Star Alliance covers everything but the South East Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
This flight is not the only option if you want to avoid the South Pacific and West Coast of South America. (see below)
In 1994, the ethnically Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan waged a war against the Azerbaijanis.
With the support of Armenia, a new republic has been created. However, no established nation, not even Armenia, officially recognizes it.
Diplomatic incidents in the region continue to hamper relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The canal district (Grachtengordel in Dutch) is the famous 17th century district that surrounds the Binnenstad of Amsterdam.
The entire area is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique cultural and historical value, and property prices are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, which means Cinque Terres, includes the five small coastal villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso in the Italian region of Liguria.
They are listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built terraces on the rugged and steep landscape to the cliffs overlooking the sea.
Part of its charm lies in the lack of visible business development. Roads, trains and boats connect villages, and cars from outside cannot access them.
The variations of French practised in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from French spoken in France, although they are sufficiently similar to be mutually intelligible.
In particular, the numbering system of French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has some small peculiarities which differ from French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of certain words is slightly different.
Nevertheless, all Belgians and French-speaking Swiss would have learned standard French at school, so they would be able to understand you even if you used the standard French numbering system.
In many parts of the world, making a sign of the hand is a friendly gesture meaning "hello".
On the other hand, in Malaysia, at least among the Malays in rural areas, it means "come this way", as the fact of folding the index to oneself, a gesture used in some Western countries, and it should only be used in this sense.
Similarly, a British traveler to Spain could confuse a farewell sign made by a person who turns the palm of his hand to himself (rather than to the person to whom he addresses the sign) with an invitation to return.
Auxiliary languages are languages, artificial or constructed, created with the aim of facilitating communication between peoples who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They are distinct from the vehicular languages, which are natural or organic languages that become dominant for one reason or another as a means of communication between speakers of other languages.
With the heat of the day, travelers can see glamours that give the illusion of water (or other things).
These can be dangerous if the traveller continues the mirage, thus wasting precious energy and remaining water.
Even the hottest desert can become extremely cold at night. Hypothermia is a real risk if you don't have warm clothes.
It is especially in summer that you will have to be careful about mosquitoes if you plan to hike in the tropical forest.
Even if you drive in the rainforest, a few seconds with the doors open while you ride in the vehicle is enough for mosquitoes to ride in the vehicle with you.
Avian influenza, or more formally avian influenza, can infect both birds and mammals.
Fewer than a thousand cases have been reported in humans, but some have been fatal.
Most involved people working with poultry, but there is also a certain risk for bird observers.
Fjords and steep valleys that suddenly give way to a more or less regular high plateau are typical of Norway.
These plateaux are often called "vidde", to designate a vast space without a tree, an expanse without limits.
In Rogaland and Adger, they are often referred to as "hei", which means deforested heaths often covered with heather.
Glaciers are not stable, but are detached from the mountain. This causes cracks, cracks, which can be obscured by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of ice caves can collapse and cracks close.
At the edge of the glaciers, huge blocks detach, fall, and perhaps bounce or roll away from the edge.
The tourist season of mountain resorts usually peaks during the Indian summer.
However, their beauty and charm evolve in winter, with many mountain resorts with plenty of snow and activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still offer bereavement rates, which slightly reduce the cost of last-minute funeral trips.
The airlines that offer them include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights from the United States or Canada, and WestJet.
In any case, you must book by telephone directly with the airline.
