The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the USOC (United States Olympic Committee) that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served, which can be done by moving forward and making significant changes within our organization, rather than revoking accreditation.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse of the proportion so courageously described by Larry Nassar's survivors could go unnoticed for so long and adopt any necessary and appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and responsible environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown brown on the top and pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
This discovery also provides a better understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, which is called rachis, but nevertheless show other features specific to feathers – beards and beards – researchers have deduced that rachis was probably a subsequent evolutionary development to these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they are not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
Scientists indicate that it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young one.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

They found that the Sun operated according to the same basic principles as the other stars. The activity of all the stars in the system is determined by their brightness, rotation and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine the number of Rossby of a star, which is related to plasma flux.
With respect to magnetic inversions, the smaller the number of Rossby, the less active the star.

The work performed was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts traction on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other black matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy lies in a sort of halo, and consists of a large number of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview, he said the new mutation was ""very disturbing and alarming due to the very high mortality rate"".
Some patients reportedly contracted the virus in the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, and at least two of them were part of the hospital staff.

Infrared images reveal, in view of the variations in temperature at day and night, that they are probably caves.
"They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night".
"Their thermal behaviour is not as stable as that of the planet's large caves that maintain a constant temperature, but they are similar in that they are deep holes in the earth," according to Glen Cushing, a member of the USGS (American Centre for Geological Studies) crew and staff at the University of Northern Arizona located at Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally an experiment of low technicality: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put in an envelope a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the agents have verified his identity, the elector throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs his voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations fairly strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelope is present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelope is added, except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision, according to specific procedures.

His other race, the giant slalom, allowed him to finish in tenth place in the women's group sitting with a combined time of 4:41.30, or 2:11.60 minutes less than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes less than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
In the women's category in sitting skiing, four skiers failed to finish their race; as far as the giant slalom is concerned, 45 out of 117 skiers in this race failed to rank.
Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We arrested five people for raping the Swiss national, and we recovered her phone and laptop."
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhatha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, police commissioner, said the accused had their faces hidden when they appeared before the court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit her, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The track where the accident took place was temporarily blocked to allow the emergency services to extract the driver from the Red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is being held in police custody pending her indictment and trial, but eye testimony could be compromised because her portrait has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice works differently and courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, has told reporters that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the dispute at the border that Palestine claims on the basis of existing borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority consents only for a period of five years.
The additional pest control test shooters had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Park Conservation and Heritage Officer at NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first slaughter campaign were properly trained and trained in safety instructions.
Martelly inducted yesterday a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
It is the fifth CEC of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to engage the country on the way to new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to the vast protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were scheduled to take place in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it had been aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "non-serious."
The department responded by describing Apple's postponement of the report as "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariannes at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office stated that no damage had been reported in that country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by detouring their bus to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been saved, and the deaths of at least six of them have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical career.
He was trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he worked in the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature deliveries during his spare time.
His research has shown that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me...or even more...I love her and I'm gonna miss her...I hope she's resting in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal election revealed that the number of opponents of Australia's transformation into a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents think Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was expected to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, which was banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest number known to date.
Several people checked the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and more specifically how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship early this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described rumours as "talking and political nonsense".
It is expected that he will run for President in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly for shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technologies, not on previously used ground radar systems, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transportation is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and relay parks are not available on the ground.
Fear of lack of transport created the possibility that the game could be played behind closed doors, without the team supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden indicated that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process was estimated to be much longer, following reproduction between an endemic Darwin's pine, Geospiza fortis, and the conical-billed immigrant pine, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be pulled in fine thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or laminated in leaves.
It can be made very fine, and glued to another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand painted images in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (since the hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with your hands clean and damp, squeeze them into a ball.
Moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and produce some kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush in almost all houses, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public baths where men and women lived side by side.
When you call a person thousands of kilometres away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest advantage it has brought us is to have made transport much simpler and faster.
This brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are more medium-sized felines that eat equally medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including pet cats at large) that eat smaller prey, many more, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
Packs consist of one to three related adult males, as well as about 30 females and lions.
Women are generally very close to each other, their families being made up of a large number of sisters and girls.
Lion troops act as packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other great felines) in their behavior, and also very deadly for their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficult), swim, jump from great distances and tow with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the broad roar of the lion, but rather a phrase whose words would be shouting and rumbling.
The ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
According to scientists, ocelots hunt and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing their way on the ground.
They see very well in the darkness thanks to their night vision, and also move very stealthily. The ocelots track their prey by resting in their environment before throwing themselves at them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily go back), it often finds itself in an environment different from that in which it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new features or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., expire).
Plants produce their food using the sun through photosynthesis, and also provide shade.
We manufacture our houses and our herbal clothing. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosaic was the superpredator of the time, he feared nothing, except the other mosaics.
His long jaws were endowed with more than 70 teeth sharp as razor blades, as well as an additional set of teeth in the palate, so that everything that crossed his path could not escape.
We are not sure, but he may have had the forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was not of size against him.
Although the Romans consumed food that we know, they ate some strange or unusual party dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and the evening, a sort of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets together where they rested on the side while they were eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not include these foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced into Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could access.
Some pyramidal towers, the ziggurates, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was in the open air.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were only open counters overlooking the street. The houses were built of stones.
Because there were no large forests in Canaan land, wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland has been sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder he found Greenland — and so named it — traveling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavia", there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you may think that a treasure map was drawn at the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
At the back of the Declaration of Independence was the words “Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776”. The text is at the bottom of the document, backwards.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (which is about 29 inches three quarters by 24 inches) was stored rolled.
It is therefore likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landing and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French of Vichy, French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting him.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Forces de la France Libre had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term "civilisation" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civilis", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means large city or city-state and which also indicates, in a sense, the size of the society to which it relates.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — Congress being its only component — under the articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the State authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from tax laws or those on tariffs between States.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all States before they could be amended and States took central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national team, the second most-titled team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that make up Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipel".
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing through it mentioned it as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous cereal production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
The Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been reconstructed to provide tourists with a better insight into their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues until today.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the format of the digital camera photographic sensor.
The 35 mm format is actually, and it's quite disconcerting, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
It is therefore said that the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of third parties, which is very ill-treated and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that stimulates dynamism while offering protection to the image.
It indicates that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked the European states with each other despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over 1000 years and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder whether this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain put in place a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters in order to prevent ships from embarking on entire maritime zones, thus threatening even neutral ships.
Since this tactic provoked only a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its limitless underwater war.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred in his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his director in his previous job) to the attention of Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different eras; every stage of China or every family that was in power was a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known of these periods is the period of the Three Kingdoms that took place for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest times in Chinese ancient history. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of XI'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, the trades were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same applies to the army, as the classification of armies is no longer based on class, but on calibre.
The French Revolution has also inspired many other repressed working classes in other countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the framework of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous as "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists. When you entered the cave, you're completely isolated.
Above, nothing can be seen but the bright and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, you can see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many giant structures erected in honor of the deceased Pharaohs.
The plateau of Giza, or "Giza necropolis", in the valley of the Dead in Egypt, consists of several pyramids (the great pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the Pharaon Kheops, and many small pyramids, graves and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The push symbol looks like a V and the pull symbol looks like a staple or a square whose lower side is missing.
The top means you must start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you must start with the rise (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow up usually produces a softer sound, while a bow down is stronger and more assertive.
Don't hesitate to write your own marks in pencil, but remember that the printed bow marks are for a musical pattern, and that you must therefore generally respect them.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of vending women.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, a member of the crowd wielded the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrorized queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the superprofits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of order.
These events took place in the period generally considered as the High Middle Ages – period of history in Europe during the 11th to 13th centuries (1000-1300).
The Central Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological thrust or technological imperative to a strict sense that the destiny of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place in a process far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on intrinsically conditioned rather than socially conditioned societies.
For example, it could be said that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive possession of cars also results in a greater incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily injury.
Romanticism featured an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture related to this geography would have appeared. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to the laws arbitrarily imposed.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered to be the capital of feudal Europe.
His reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned to carry out gifts such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th–10th century and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, to the east.
However, because of the slow pace of communication, Western modes could lag 25 to 30 years behind.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothes.
Subsistence farming is an agriculture used to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system using conserved seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas which allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and/or gender of members.
Criteria that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often report their belonging by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, as a result of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
Some wild children have been confined by persons (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the parents' rejection of a serious intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child.
Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When fully reared by non-human species, wild children display behaviours (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a learning method but rather a way to help learners who discover new teaching such as using a new program or starting a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little man trombone of Microsoft Office is one too.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to question, guide and explain procedures that could have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but it is.
We see the foster care system as a safe area for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to usages and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are seen as major drivers of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal Involvement" and "Continuing Relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when studying public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person lies by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people unable to understand the speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such interpretive abilities of human behaviour may be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research of the twentieth century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate the variations between the two basins at each generation.
In savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy his needs for amino acids from available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all vital amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" a little in the same way as savannah chimpanzees do today.
Interruption of sleep is the process of intentional awakening during your sleep period and falling asleep shortly after (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively silent awakening, in order to make you regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on biorhythm include drinking a lot of fluids before falling asleep (including water or tea, known for being diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
A person's degree of inner peace opposes the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present vital force. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the way of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras activated, and the awakening consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the understanding between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the cold war began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see real clashes, through alternative armies, on battlefields both in Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and in many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, be they bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for freight transport is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and your property, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and property.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly using U-Boots, was attempting to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient crops and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered the hills or other pasture areas, often cared for by chevriers who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the more known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods are still going on today.
The "carways" were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the railcar tracks were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses who pulled them to reach higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
The crossovers were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were fitted with an iron strip on top.
This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of cars.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ("right man").
Their predecessors, the Australopitheques, did not walk upright as usual.
Biped specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even militate to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, this is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a great deal as a result of scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that the problems have become more important because of the overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few streets from there, to John Dunlap's printing shop.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that are still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs have survived and are still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them dinosaurs given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs covered with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both back legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the handling of information that is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic drugs or domestic chemicals.
See the label for the first aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitic humans.
Reducers, like bedbugs, are nestling, i.e. adapted to live in their host's nest or habitat.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young people and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optical nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may well feel that it is not in their best interests, or in the interests of the child, to care for the upbringing of a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption project for their baby.
In the context of adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which guides most scientific research.
However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to mark either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the part of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially wildlife.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
One can, for example, go to see, photograph and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns by car to get to their place of work and meet other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a passenger car-based transport system.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear as many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
The traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be mathematically approximated.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
The insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape their enemies and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragon flies and ephemerals.
A few thousand years ago, a man called Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
No less than 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed by their size and technical excellence in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, peoples have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, as they are found in nature in raw form and are quite simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
Rather, they were the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also expressed the theory that they turn into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
We also find alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new methods of writing has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to rarer uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty comes.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
It's like we're climbing a hill to a heavy cart, dividing the core again, then releasing a little of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible face and 100 km on the hidden face.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker below continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is finer. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
The theories of content are centered on researching what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what in their environment drives them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's theory of two factors.
In general, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the leader of former colleagues. From one end of the spectrum being trying to stay "the good friend" (or the good girlfriend).
Such managers find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, conduct disciplinary actions, conduct evaluations, assign responsibilities, and hold others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created until then and do things in his/her own way.
After all, the chief is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behaviour often leads to divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact of their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member is accountable and sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to impose on itself the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the substantive services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the client's need.
Before an organisation is innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus reducing the field of research and making it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of damage, injury, tumours and brain trauma affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study previously unheard of brain structures and processes.
This gives us a lot of information and hardware to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often highly known as science fiction, it represents a very important part of the computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The aim of artificial intelligence research is to automate by task machines requiring an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to separate disciplines, focusing on the provision of solutions to the problems of daily life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been planted in several home computer and video game software.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can look at the ancient objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a superb work of art while sitting with their class.
Practically participating in an excursion is also a great way to think about a trip and share experiences with future generations.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design an annual website dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but older versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often try out the blog experience with a neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes the situation.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog's author begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to better understand the world around them." The need to generate public interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"When good use is made of it, blogs "may enable students to strengthen their analytical skills and critical thinking: by actively reacting to online content, they can compare their opinions with those of others and present their own views on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a large number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south you will find Niagara Falls and to the north, the Muskoka area and its surroundings, which have a pristine natural beauty.
All of these measures, and many others, make Ontario what foreigners consider to be Canada's quintessence.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the African east coast.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent by itself, in terms of wildlife.
Most small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known to be luxury resorts.
Arabs have also brought the practice of Islam to the land and this religion has spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Town road linking Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a covenant (which should not seem too valuable.
Women must realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviours that they consider harassment, as it is common for them to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in the refusal of men's advances, and don't be afraid to stand firm (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sinners in the 10th century B.C.E., and was used by Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after destroying it had rebuilt it and baptized Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading counters there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to make purchases.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, narguilés and bibelots of all kinds, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma needs to be researched to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for treks tracking mountain gorillas among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motor taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a small race.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctu" has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates' show "Wonders of the African World" on the PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the cities of the rest of the country, as it has a more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in north-east South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the south border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km2, divided into 14 ecozones, each housing a specific wildlife.
It is one of the best-known amusement parks in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It may be advantageous to get a Wild Card that provides access to some South African parks, as well as all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main centre of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings drawing the Hong Kong horizon has been compared to a shimmering bar graph, which reveals itself by reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and join the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on the island of Hong Kong is concentrated on the plains of the north shore.
This is the place British settlers have invested, so it seems to me to be a good starting point, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called the Sundarban National Park.
The forests, however, are not composed solely of mangrove marshes; they also contain some of the last remains of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered with water/marcage areas.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, where you can find about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (located on the other side) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often complete, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coasters, which are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a low-rise bridge. It overlooks the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two tracks 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in subsistence farming.
Other indigenous tribes that populated the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or Payaguá, survived mainly through fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once known as "the giant province of India", was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo courts of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and games are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and places to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the pound of the Falkland Islands (FKP) whose value is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
Pound sterling is a widely accepted currency throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted.
On the surrounding islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even though British and American currencies may be. Talk ahead with the owners to agree on a method of payment.
It is almost impossible to trade Falklands money outside the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located in the south of Ecuador, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be misleadingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than the thermometer says.
There are not really any "dried" and "dry" seasons: precipitation is almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, they are wildlife; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to park authorities, at least 100 metres from bears and wolves and 25 metres from all other wildlife!
As docile as they may appear, bison, momentum, moose, bear and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid transporting or cooking smelly food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a sadly famous naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was murdered during a peaceful rally in town, during the struggle of independence organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, as Auckland is riding on two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour District) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and allow for safe swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the port of Waitemata, in the chic suburb of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very crowded by families, have many shops along the coast. Bathing is safe there.
The main local beer is the "Number One", a rather ordinary but tasty and refreshing beer. There is also another local beer, the "Manta".
There are a lot of French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink local tap water safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "coffee cream" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay special attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, box jellyfish arrived near the beaches and estuaries of rivers, and they could sometimes also be seen outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would deviate from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
The reservation in advance gives the traveller the peace of mind to know that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping areas, through travel agencies.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even packages that combine flight and accommodation.
They can also withhold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or get you other documents needed for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider this to be an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed camping area.
Don't forget that even if the musical shows are finished on the main stages, other musical shows can continue until late in the night on other sites of the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, make sure to check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noises at the most exposed cabins.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempted from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are rarely found there, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of dishes, drinks and entertainment in order to maintain the good mood of the guests and keep them there.
On some sites, locals offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. Nevertheless, drunkenness alters judgment, and all good players know it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone travelling by car at high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, it can fall in very short time enough snow to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or snow or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important moment for many visitors.
In common language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion on African land, and particularly in the savannah, with the aim of attending the sight seizing wild animals in their surroundings.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars closely and standard equipment allows them to be observed well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also referred to as a bush walk, a walking safari, or a footing) consists of hiking for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most of the cancellation policies based on coronaviruses do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing about 7,000 yen.
By ironing wet clothes, you can make it easier to dry them. Many hotels have iron and ironing board that can be loaned, even if there are none in the rooms.
If you don't have an iron or you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you find one.
Avoid letting the fabric overheat (which can cause it to shrink or in extreme cases burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some localities, it is enough to boil the water for one minute; in others, it is necessary to boil for several minutes.
Filter efficiency varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests that they do not know in their area of origin.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some localities, duty-free shops offer an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from excise taxes and duties.
Travellers to countries where taxes are high can sometimes make considerable savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your mind open: steep slopes, narrow lanes and tight curves predominate.
The posted speed limitations are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict respect is even greater than before.
On the other hand, mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are rather good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common: apples are cooked and baked throughout the year, while cherries and plums point the tip of their nose in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often blend particularly well with a tight cup of coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try the Berlin balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made of herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be "solid" or "liquid", depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yoghurt is commonly used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
As Indonesia has 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines across the country.
However, when this term is used without further qualification, it tends to refer to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavours Javanese prefer are peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrs are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety problem: indeed, the user's feet can remain stuck there.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth and narrow heel and sole.
Then, some saddles, especially the English, have safety bars that allow a stretcher to fall from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large different granite walls and cliffs.
From the top of the mountain, the panoramas on the mountains are breathtaking. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly discovering new paths that can be used on the slopes, where the possibilities are unlimited.
Downhill winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down a snow-covered track with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many aficionados, sometimes called "ski bums", which organize their entire holidays according to skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings showing skiers date for some 5,000 years BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century; the first leisure ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing: This activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or touring skiing.
This is similar to alpine skiing, as well as mountaineering, but does not generally incorporate these activities, which are practised on rough terrain and require the use of skis and boots that are much more rigid.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to travel a little longer distances than on foot – but you will only very rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but one with many independent countries, so under conventional circumstances, travelling across several countries requires several visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without crossing through passport checkpoints.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each of the countries members of the space, thus saving time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition of whether a manufactured object is an antiquity. Some tax agencies define property over 100 years old as antiquities.
The criteria vary depending on where you are; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Artisan products may be considered antiques, even if they are less old than similar industrial products.
Reindeer farming is an important means of livelihood for the Sami and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer farming, they lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer primarily as line animals.
Today, many Sami are engaged in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
Although very widely used, especially among non-roms, the term "Gitan" is often regarded as pejorative because of its association with negative stereotypes and a distorted image of the Roma people.
If the country you are travelling to is the subject of a travel warning issued by your government, your health insurance abroad or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also use advice from other governments than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East might face situations different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
The opinions are only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and too simplified in relation to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that may cause damage, serious social upheaval or loss of life.
Very unfavourable weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and can be of several kinds, depending on geographic, topographical and atmospheric characteristics.
Severe winds, hail, excessive rainfall and fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, marine tromps and cyclones.
Extreme weather events, regional and seasonal, include cold storms, snow storms with severe winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to learn about the risks of bad weather that may affect their destination area, knowing that this may affect the routes they are considering.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
An internet search of "Hospitable Environment Course" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
Training normally lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes training in weapons handling.
Books and magazines dealing with wildlife survival are common, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning a sex-change transaction abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for their return trip in their possession.
The willingness of governments to issue passports whose sex is not indicated (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and sex varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is equally variable.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Transsexual persons in the pre-operative phase should not expect to pass the scanners by preserving their privacy and dignity.
The ripping currents are the currents that come back from the waves that break down on the beach, often on a pit or equivalent.
Due to underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a rapid current towards the deep waters can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from an attempt to swim against current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, returning to swimming is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again. It's also possible, that depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted or not, you may want to wait for help.
The reintegration shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travellers who have had difficulty adapting to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your original culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers to a new country must adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travellers returning home.
The pyramid-style sound and light show is one of the region's most interesting attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you hear the noise of tourists and sellers. The history of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples include the island of Livingston and the Deception, where the caldera flooded with a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southern part of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula melt into the plateau, and then reappear to form the 360-km-long Ellsworth Mountain Range through the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which peaks at 4892 m.
In remote locations, without a cellular telephone network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions with remote data transmission and telephone requirements.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about the connection to this service.
Those planning a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn by traveling, and more and more of them choose this possibility.
This formula is particularly appreciated by young people who leave school, as it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.
Often, taking sabbatical year courses abroad can actually give you a better chance of higher education in your country.
As a general rule, fees are charged to attend these educational programs.
Finland is a destination of choice for recreational boating. The "Land of the Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are actually large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Recreational boating is a national hobby in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises are characterized by an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while coming back to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore with cruise trips, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the sea and no visit of this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by plane can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
We must not be ashamed of it: it is no different from the personal fears and fears that many people feel about other things.
For some, understanding something about the operation of aircraft and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not having control.
Transport companies are well paid to make quick deliveries. Often, as part of an urgent repair, the issue of delays is crucial for related documents, goods or spare parts.
On some roads, large companies have their own aircraft, but on other roads and for small businesses, there has been a problem.
If they had sent goods by air cargo, on some routes, it would have taken days to pass the unloading and customs.
The only way to send it more quickly was to send it as checked baggage. Air regulations will not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that is where you intervene.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to pay a large amount of money for this privilege (or, better still, ask your business to do so for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for the business class, and eleven times for the first class!
Generally speaking, there is no need to seek reductions for business-class or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of travellers who are willing to pay very dearly for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they establish their fares with knowledge.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but recognized by no United Nations member country.
The economic links between these two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is Turkey's third largest city, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent connecting platform.
What was the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, developed and living shopping center, set around a huge bay, surrounded by mountains.
The large boulevards, glazed buildings and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red tile roofs, the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that more recalls Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and houses an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures depicting doves on some graves.
It's worth walking for half an hour in this fascinating village.
The romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, located to the north, is easily accessible and has been made famous to strangers by Lord Byron's vivid account of its splendor.
Scotturb's 403 bus regularly travels to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
On your way north, be sure to visit the magnificent shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (temple), a world famous place for Mary's apparitions.
Remember that you visit essentially a mass grave, as well as a site that has an almost incalculable meaning for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who survived their stay here, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labour, Jews or non-Jews indiscriminately.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not disfigure the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as the law establishes that this is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have the reputation of being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave at best, to act like a very high person. This will greatly facilitate your travel.
The abrupt exteriors of Parisians evaporate quickly if you show a minimum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, mainly beech, spruce and fir, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a wide variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils and altitude levels.
The region is also home to a wide variety of animal species and birds.
Rare animals such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and large grouse can be seen, as well as many other common species.
When visiting a monastery, women must wear skirts covering their knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide stoles to women who arrive without anything, but if you bring yours, and besides it has bright colors, you will have a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Just like men must wear pants covering their knees.
We can also borrow this garment from the stock at the entrance, but since it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. A unique size for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and all available condiments, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, followed by the word Sie that means you, always start with a capital, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an excellent way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
One can also say that it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The main letters to be monitored are c and g, as their pronunciation varies according to the next vowel.
Please also make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" in a separate way: "caro" means "price", while "carro" means "caro".
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Needless to say, if you know a Roman language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough to it so that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution in their time was not as worrying as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge infrastructures located in remote areas where weather conditions are favourable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where plum flowers were the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first festival of flowering cherry trees was organized by the emperor only for himself and the other members of the nearby aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants have their best appearance when found in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "one."
If you visit a strictly landscaped garden, the collection of "samples" will also cause you to be expelled without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to move, and where you can buy almost everything you need once you arrive on site.
But, located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to adapt to the heat (always) and strong sunlight (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also a few buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of biblical patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you are planning to take is going to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kyriat Arba.
Inland waterways can be an excellent theme for holidays.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or cruise to interesting sites on the Danube or boat along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking trails and bike paths.
Christmas is one of Christendom's most important festivals, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions related to these festivals have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
It is a tradition to spend the night of Easter awake in an open place to see the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches often organize a Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into the feast at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived on these islands originally did so by water, swimming, floating objects, or by air.
Due to the great distance between them and the continent, mammals could not go to the end of the voyage, making the giant turtle the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since man's arrival in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can discover the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to admire the northern lights, as the sky will be dark almost all day.
Because the regions are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than the one that Westerners can be used to.
Costumes are classic workwear, and collaborators are called by their surname or function.
Harmony at the workplace is crucial because it focuses on collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain the approval of their superiors for any decision they make and are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without asking questions.
