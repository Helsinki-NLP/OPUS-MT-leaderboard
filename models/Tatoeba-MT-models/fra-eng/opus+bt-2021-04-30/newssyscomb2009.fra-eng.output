Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current major coalition, as well as a notable strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the current President Wilhelm Molterer's position is seriously threatened, suffered particularly large losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthie Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphal return to the political scene at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the vote, the country's first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 per cent of the vote.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent loses almost nine percent of the vote, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major parties in the post-war period; especially for the popular party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Again in early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable lead over the SPÖ.
However, the voters were visibly punishing them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations about the possible resignation of the party leader and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were pronounced.
Observers believe that this could happen on Monday, during the extraordinary leadership council of the party.
Such a development would a priori facilitate the way towards the outcome of the election outcome, which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the great SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
Nevertheless, in view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 per cent and BZÖ 11 per cent of the votes - the socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repeat of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ separated from it) on a common government, which even caused sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he is planning to return to Vienna on the national political scene, apparently relies on this development.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell, among the Austrian political parties, from the third in fifth position.
Clearly, no other party crossed the four per cent limit and did not accede to parliament.
Schwarzenberg: India's relationship may get colder
If the problem of the Czech researchers accused of illegally collecting cockroaches in India could not be resolved, then, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, some cooling of Czech-Indian relations would ensue.
The minister declared it today in New York, after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, some cooling would happen," he observed after the meeting, which was carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, on leaving the talks, that it was difficult for the executive branch to intervene in judicial matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was discharged from the charge and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling government, the case being placed under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could apply for bail and wait for the trial at large, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also spoke in the same direction during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide convicts with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them by India.
" Above all, we want to keep the best relations with India, which have a tradition that continues over many years.
The Indians also recognized him," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We regard the imprisonment and accusation of these Czech researchers as a great scorn," he said.
The minister dodged the question if he got a promise from India to take care of the matter.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he said only.
A Czech arbiter the fight for the sea floor
It approaches a mural electronic map, on which is represented Australia and adjacent marine areas.
Now, he is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent sea floor.
However, this area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of thirty members of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the division director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
Ardent work and enthusiasm characterize the reigning atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little-known world, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found there, but also living organisms that are currently unknown, which may contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A broader background than land
The coastal states have now begun to vehemently aspire to the new submarine territories.
According to a UN convention, they use their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental self, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
According to the Convention, this last one may claim exclusively all the resources of the continental self.
"To simplify, the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea, is considered to be continental shelf.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the 200 nautical miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic yone," Mikulka explains.
The request that the country in question submit to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a wide range of scientific and technical documentation, based on numerous costly prospections and mettering.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the Commission has dealt with five applications, namely those from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the time being, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," Mikulka adds.
Australia's success, which was the first to significantly expand its underwater possessions, has recently had a global impact.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory — the extent of the seabed, which was allocated to it by the commission last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometres, which represents the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefit they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they project, be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries, in turn, will submit their requests.
They may do so within ten years of ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention".
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the zone of the ocean floor, proclaimed by convention "common patrimony of humanity".
There, no State has an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by an international institution established by convention.
"Nevertheless, let's not be mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," says Director Mikulka, saying that "its areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now also owned by the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states in the former bloc of Eastern countries within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
It obtained in 1991 under the Convention, as did investors from a few other states, the status of the so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is turbulent, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It is possible to extract on an expanse with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," lists Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurist.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a concretion.
It recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The German special forces were there for the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had requested Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready but they never took action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are revealed.
According to information from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both Federal Army specialists and GSG 9 officials, the Federal Police Air Flight and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from Technischen Hilfwerk, were at the scene of the release.
As the Ministry spokesman reported on Monday evening, German forces were ultimately not required, as hostage-takers released their prisoners and fled when they acknowledged the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government would have accepted Germany's assistance to integrate it locally as a support force.
"It has fortunately not happened so far," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers abducted in southern Egypt the group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transbashed into the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers has so far remained vague, as has the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have meanwhile arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the time being, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five vacationers and special forces should have taken off aboard an Air Force Airbus and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Denies Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress just failed the $700 billion bailout plan for the capital markets.
The Dow Jones was sinking into the abyss.
With 227 votes against 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the bailout plan for the government's financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of US President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was to curb financial market chaos did not get the majority.
In a dramatic manoeuvre, the parties had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the merits of this $700 billion heavy plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called for a favourable vote, although the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to have political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he conceded.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones dropped by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was the investor's concern that the state rescue plan could foil.
He came back shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of failure, fell again.
Experts are now projecting further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, the approval and the approval of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are necessary.
Organizers report increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months, according to a study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 per cent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the Germans' thirst for travel remains insatiable according to this study.
With regard to bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded sales of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) entrusted to Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing numbers of bookings are already dominant in the autumn months.
As a result, sales would have increased to about 11 per cent compared to 2007, the RVD.
The sources of these results are the figures of the GfK, which analyses monthly the booking data of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low price of the dollar, travel to the US would be particularly requested, the DRV said.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about a third party.
Next to this, Spain, Turkey and Greece and our country would be particularly sought after by the Germans.
Especially organized trips are very much in demand, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices for energy and food products, the costs here would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individual tour".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with early booking discounts or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very much taken into account, so that an increase in sales figures will again be recorded compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who embarked on a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continuously, beer in pitchers per litre and celebrities in designer Tyrolean costumes.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't actually have much in common.
She is blonde, television host and wears a tailor-made Tyrolean suit.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves at us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and that on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean suit seems to be reaching its goal.
As a beer party tourist and normally residing north of the Weißwurst equator, my feeling of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once in Thérèse Square, everything is half the worse.
Everyone or almost everyone wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; no one looks blasé or ashamed - it's completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean suit picks up some weird eyestrokes at the banana-shock stand.
A Bavarian woman pointed out to me that I would have wrongly tied my apron: "to the left means free, in the middle virgin, to the right squared, to the back widow."
Discreetly, I'm tripping my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she tells me and laughs.
Others don't do so much trouble for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which is written "Too drunk to get trained!" and exposes their naked back-train to us without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, arrives from England and comes for the first time to the beer festival.
He thinks it's "throat," with a "oooo" lying down.
He's been telling me all this after he'd been relieved of what he'd been drinking before.
Right next to that fire hydrant that everyone thinks is a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild peeers."
Others don't have the chance to get rid of alcohol that way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics run to the party square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Rather, the nurses pack - always by four, they drag their stretcher covered with tents in tents.
It works like this for most beer party visitors: we go empty, we come back full of it.
Those who rest in the coffin of the stuffed under the tarpaulin are not visible.
"These are the ones who can no longer swallow anything," shouts one of the rescuers in answer to my question and then disappears in the melee.
Accident victim identified by police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident, in town, on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to the Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He's been released ever since, on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were looking forward to entering its hinterland.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps away, from Asia, is one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what the guides tell us.
The monument is set on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation towers at each of its corners, like some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, retarded to the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding area, generated by the cold war's icy borders, is over.
. The British and empire forces advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say this is sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, swallowed up in the meanderings of history.
But today, the railway crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, serves- at least symbolically, to highlight the enlargement of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding area, caused by the cold war's icy borders
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a sleeping car towards the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit MP Turkish AKP Suât Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a journey of 10 and a half hours, shaken on noisy tracks whose rhythm reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital - presented as a new city of a new age-old state, turning my back on its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots is an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built of stones and steel, in a developing area, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and numerous pastries in which middle managers in suit-tie-men and women- meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"the aim of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey now into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its backcountry.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
That was not the case for both.
She had to do both.
"but, now, at some point, "I asked if" should Turkey not choose?".
"Turkey" he said "does not want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out one aspect that almost everyone I have been able to speak with, recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway not only goes to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, it is therefore, as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe that travels metaphorically on the tracks to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleeping, I thought about these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, to a large extent, be in Turkey's hands.
As I waited at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been named "the sick of Europe".
At least there is no longer any doubt on the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Musical director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died 11 September) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic choir of young people, Proteus.
The choir had to include the under-21s, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years old- refused to abandon the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the will and the ability of the choir to manage any type of music was presented to it, whether it was Madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there, in the music.
So sing!"
His baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be named a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them ever disappointed me-- and, a few times, they even inspired me
Tod Handley held such a rare combination of grandeur and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, "focus only on certain people".
A lot of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (died 25 September) states that "in 1946 he had resumed his studies in economic history in Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while doing a BSc, MA, and PhD".
That's what came from Woodruff's letter in Beyond Nab End, but that's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "the Flamenco and life" because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments".
Second assault for Honda's super sales
In November Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
While its predecessor already had good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
In addition to this there are some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more gasoline.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
So it's the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz features a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them are innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before looking at the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation comes on the market.
First, it is noted that Honda renovated this model in a shorter time frame than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Honda Jazz is less well known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83 000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it plans to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The Spanish subsidiary hopes to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely offset the decline in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand hopes to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 fewer cars than in 2007, a 16% decrease in sales.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters in length - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year around the world.
Depending on the markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The Insight's commercial launch is planned for the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 metres (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 metres (two centimeters more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 metres, representing an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change or 1.52 meters.
The dimensions are increasing and the interior space is also increasing.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a reserve of petrol in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - can hold up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity than the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or the panoramic roof - is improving access to rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, relative to the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2- and 1.4-litre gasoline propellants.
Both engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine develops 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4.900 rpm.
This propellant - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous thruster, which on the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now reaches 100 horsepower.
This 100 horsepower 1.4L Honda Jazz has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired this time by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the theft of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers from Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Centre have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan security shield.
This robot will allow brand vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space of an oval shape that looks much like the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the bee's composed eyes, able to see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly continuously inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is known as a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles over a distance of two metres and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"When it detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bifurcating its wheels by 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The greatest difference from any other existing system is that the escape manoeuvre is totally instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Moving Laboratory and main engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, but also an acceleration and deceleration function, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
" Each second this device must only process the information and act according to that data.
It does not need to keep the information or intuitive logics of prior maneuvers, which is why it can run continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise us, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes."
This represents the first car to develop new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced into standard cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ions batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They're afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be acknowledged that the United States Treasury, besides having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without geniuses.
Faced with the crisis, and in order to avoid the Americans embarking on mortgages with credit banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is to say 'the Hotel of bad credits' ... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Master of Hotel leads us to think several times if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it.
It's sure this game gives useful but little detailed information.
It's more of a game for teenagers.
¿What if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will pay $9 billion to take 21% of its capital, a news received by a sharp drop in its stock exchange price.
A week after announcing an interim agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would purchase 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common shares at a price of $25.25, or a total of $3 billion.
The price chosen is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, or 28% above its current price.
The Morgan Stanley action, however, lost 6.79% to $23.07 around 5:00 PM GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," said John Mack, CEO of the US group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but put it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday further show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago," explained Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, "we thought the stake would be entirely composed of common shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement previews that MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into common shares if the latter trade more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. to about 47 dollars, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital brought by MUFG will enable him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
However, a spokesperson for the group refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to display a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he had "clearly" lightened his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, which has seen its stock market price melt by half as the cost of insurance against default risk on its debt is rising.
This cost fluctuated on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, in part with Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refounding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, he was the third to vote on a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" won 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the exit of polling stations and a count by a non-governmental organization had announced a large victory of the "yes", between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly," he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place calmly according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), concerned a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the State over the economy, reserving to it the "planning of the development" of a country living mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currencies sent by its emigrants.
Carried out by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, who will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services which the President has begun to establish in that country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back this Monday afternoon safe and sound to the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at about 3:30 p.m. on a special plane at al-Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, aboard helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examination.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers," said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the tarmac.
Captured on 19 September during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the edge of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been flogged from one hideout to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organiser of the safari.
An Egyptian security official reported that 30 members of the special forces, transported on board two helicopters, had launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of gunshots occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled," said the official who demanded anonymity.
He reported that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "flash" unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men in the secret services, the special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The previous day, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle in which the kidnappers were on patrol, killing in six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture headlines and occupies this election campaign.
Good.
But an area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the amount of misery that is being given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are starving?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, elected officials and government departments, in concert.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des Sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving with three under private archive piles, and preserving archaeological remains.
It is they, often, who are the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision-makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When, a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Bank Fortis
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Holland bank, as the first European bank in distress as a result of the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partly nationalising it. The three countries support, to the sum of 11.2 billion euros, this financial and insurance institution also owns interest in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also involving the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been growing for more than a year is for Bank Fortis. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy almost half (up to 49%) of the bank's capital in each of the countries.
The bank will, without any doubt, sell a portion of its holdings, among which, first of all, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch agency ABN Amro.
Last week, the Fortis shares began a dizzying fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to let it go to bankruptcy.
On Friday alone, the company's shares dropped by 12 percent, to its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the present value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around €14 billion, which, according to the company's management, is unrealistic.
The company's management is uncertain, in relation to the adoption of the $700 billion U.S. rescue plan, that it was responsible for the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, there has already been a slight increase in the number of papers.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new managing director.
The financial agency was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the substance.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's customer circle and no agency was stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also bought leasing companies.
A fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about his purchases of medicines.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that link the use of prescription information in all cases to the consent of the data subject.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting its henhouse to a fox" - recalled Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage medication prescriptions, at the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the capital insured in the event of damage, depend on the health of the client who comes forward, and if they think the risk is too great, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent the candidates for a medical examination, and they only signed an insurance contract with them after they became aware of the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he easily obtains data from pharmacies on the person's purchases of medicines within the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, what disease the person suffers and what is his state of health.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts him in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is no longer much left for the insurer to do except for paperwork. However, tiny problems may still arise.
Disadvantages of this program include the fact that a drug can be used for a variety of purposes. For example, some mixtures may be used against migraine or hot flushes, but may also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of the data, and they must apply to the patient for authorisation before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their failures in the past.
Recently, some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory analyses and linking them with data on drug use, and in this way they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of usage is becoming more and more difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the enlargement of the control circle of the authorities concerning companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his programme, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive consent of the data subject.
It is also a question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her consent or not, since if he or she refuses, the insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
So and ultimately, the hens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other, largely global, issues.
Today, a France-India summit will also be held, focusing on cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is a great emerging democratic power that should be given a wider right to speak in international affairs, but member countries have not yet managed to agree on their support in New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not dwell too much on this issue yesterday at the 9th summit held in Marseilles.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, like the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would double trade, meaning an increase of about 100 billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an overly ambitious objective.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral agreements with India on civil flights, and in this way air trade will also be able to expand in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, the EU's leading trading partner, on the one hand, and New Delhi, on the other, which is only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan had been strongly condemned, as had all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on that subject had been raised.
The completion of the Doha trade round has also been called for, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains committed to the energy and climate agenda, in particular that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic materials by at least 20 per cent until 2020.
India also agreed on this, as well as with the need for a global market at next year's climate conference, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by fifty per cent until 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of State is now travelling to the French capital, where during a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the news agency's information, the agreement would cover 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than 300 Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits for this edition, more than 7 miles exhibitors coming from 101 various countries that will occupy the 171.790 square meters of the Salon with more than 403 thousand titles in exhibition, and Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Property and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, during the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: indeed, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with a Point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a press meeting in the Room Struktur, at butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospectives on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author's books is gradually decreasing in relation to the total Italian production, and in particular, in relation to that for adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire missing a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3000 metres, in the area of the Sierra Nevada of Mammanth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, no human remains, however.
Madera County sheriff John Anderson overruled the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found on or around the aircraft.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Board (NTsb) reported that a few hours after the wreckage, a team of investigators sent to the scene, identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, missing on September 3, 2007, when Fosset detonated from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal belongings were found by a couple around their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents bearing the name Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash species and a sweater.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
By the sixth attempt, he had become in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had travelled around the world by plane and without stopover.
Among all these records, also that of flying at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a co-driver.
Glk, the ad you don't expect.
An exceptional 4x4 of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and clear angles.
This is, in summary, Glk, the latest born off-road "compact" of the house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
Just because of its out-of-standard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showroom, from next October 17th.
Thus the advertising thrashing that will accompany the beginning of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, one will have the impression that by looking at the image, the auto comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertisement, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of motorist communication.
Will it succeed with this formula in attracting the interest of future acquirers? We will see well.
These are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the "Ultras Italy" group that has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created big problems.
Nor had ever clashed with the opposing tifosi.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (rather in reality) from Campania and Puglia were added.
They had three-coloured flags on which their original city appeared: Saturday night, they were all removed for not being identified.
They are inspired by English tifosery.
In Bulgaria, they found a tifosery of real Nazists, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian tifosi, 144 tickets for the part: all nominatives, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had indeed controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian tifosi who had a history of stadium crime, were not allowed the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal waits to read the acts that will happen from the Bulgarian police, and then will take action: in this case, it may be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the disorder purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that forbids to attend Italian, but also European, stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer get off the stadium.
Fortunately.
But now it is time for fear-emulation: that is, others risk being added to the first 150.
"We must put an end to this fire immediately, and not legitimize which behaves like this," the Viminal says.
So, "Keep your eyes open especially in view of Wednesday's national team game in Lecce"
In Apulia there is indeed a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets on Tuesday the Casms which can even count on a section of the Asylum, that is to say the secret services, which deal precisely with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched out during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently, director of the Observatory of the Viminal (he took the post of Francesco Tagliaente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste where resides a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 tifosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds #1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
So far, this group has remained in the rules, now we will see what has happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles towards Mameli's hymn: these too are not crimes, but if you'll allow me, they're not polite..."
