Barack Obama to be the fourth U.S. president to receive Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth U.S. President in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be presented to him, among other things, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and will have a busy program.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the very first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple's schedule then includes an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will be crowned in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, but only the third that will be awarded the prize in the Committee's own premises.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he receives this award by being a president who is currently waging a war in two countries.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish krones (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate it to charities, but he has not yet decided which ones.
His busy program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at first.
He mentioned, for example, that he felt that he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as the announcement was made, he stated that it would be an "invitation to act".
An advocate of nature accused of blackmail
The Litomixice police charged the president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litomixice with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction project procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for withdrawing his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesman for the Litom Didnice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litom thereto is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and faces up to three years' imprisonment.
Waste sorting bins are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packages, while in the villages of South Moravia you find sorting bins at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you'd have to take several minutes to find the right dumpsters.
I don't mean we wouldn't sort out the waste at all in Brno.
But I have the impression that the city councillors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially given the number of dumpsters dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle into the city centre?
It is a whole science, which requires mainly time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found right now is the Moravia square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't blame me, but it doesn't seem very much to me.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it's not a sinecure either.
So, finally, many of my friends don't sort their garbage.
Laziness.
It makes them a trot to get to the dumpsters.
I'm not surprised at them.
I myself, after a party, offered to go and throw out a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any colored dumpsters on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place by taking the tram.
That said, the waste overflowed with it.
It's after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to best represent the city, right?!
It is probably that ecology and so-called aesthetics do not interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city across the country, instead of buying some extra dumpsters and offering sorting more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad to have been able to reinforce my impression with official statistics after hanging out for a while on the internet.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravia region.
Parubek's budget has taken away money for pensions and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or civil servants may lack money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on State debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make borrowings for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting the problems back to later, undermining the ground," said Janota.
It should be noted that interest on the borrowed money is increasing and will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state doesn't really have a choice to find out where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social assistance or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those who the left has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater government debt - next year there will not be 163 billion in the caisses, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will grow more and more rapidly and with it, interest-related expenses.
The state will need money to pay it back and it will no longer be enough to increase VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
There will also be a shortage of five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly parts already decided and started, and it is not possible to modify the projects to reduce costs.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major projects, and the collection of European funds is also at risk, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very adroitly - it will draw from the dividends of the ČEZ (supplier and distributor of electrical energy), which the state owns in large part and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is in no way a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement pension accounts or to serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit by 5.7 per cent of GNP according to EU rules.
And this is far from the end of the Carnival of Transfers.
The budget for various compensations to the victims of communism and crime, and even housing savings, has fallen by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without that money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the department's side or, at worst, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a shortfall of one hundred million in the two-billion state cash project, which is intended to track on-line the expenditures of each administration.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister could not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just one button and you move from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the objective of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them into staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware company in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and it was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is by no means fictional.
VMware has already successfully introduced a test version to journalists, of a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now working with European and US operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to devices in 2012.
The shortage of snow in the mountains bothers hoteliers
Desert runways are not a problem only for ski lift operators.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they ask right away if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info news portal.
If you want to spend the New Year's Eve of your dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, it's better not to hesitate to book.
If savings are given priority and the quality of accommodation comes only afterwards, then one can try to wait a few more days.
Hoteliers in Špindler only offer one-week stays for New Year's Eve at the moment.
I think they'll try to place them for a while, but they'll also give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura estimated.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We are most interested in Christmas week at the moment, it is not completely sold.
It's still free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared some cheaper last minute Christmas stays," said Ingtours manager Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourist agency can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February leave just as well, the remaining winter stays sell medium.
This year's interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to start falling.
No one wants to spend the winter in the snowless mountain.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will also be complete," says Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Snókou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We've got a few last seats left for New Year's Eve as well as Christmas.
There is great interest during the Polish holidays of January and February also sells well," informs Karel Rada, manager of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the central car park of Jánské Lázně is also eighty percent complete during the New Year's period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupancy at present.
February is a little weaker for now but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše will certainly grow again indicated the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
However, Krkonoše hoteliers should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and if there is rain, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But later, the weather should warm up, informs Jiř Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: Repetition Is Mother of Wisdom · Global Voices
He even becomes a comic, the tireless effort with which Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of wiseness, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan question, which he himself considered to be quite simple.
When he finally let his doctrine sweat so eagerly awaited, it turned out that he had copied it to carbon paper since Bush's three-year-old Iraqi scenario.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, what is more, to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending further reinforcements into an Iraq consumed by the civil war as being "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which was based on the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only one that could and could be so successful that the newspapers at present do not talk about Iraq at all.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, however, objectively speaking, he left his successor with a final situation far more favourable than could be expected.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It was again the campaign commanders who called for an increase in the military contingent, including the Afghan Operation Commander, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House's reluctance despite subordination habits.
He asked for 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, he at least conned the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to extirpate the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though he originally had 10,000.
What causes the most problems throughout Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this entire process within three years. Obama's entire doctrine brings in more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase of half will bring the same results as the increase in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out by the exact opposite — there is no one to count on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing their leadership on a day-to-day basis.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only powder in the eyes behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is singularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity about the reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "quick-to-act state", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The temporal horizon of Obama's strategy makes it perplexed by his voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their "prompt home" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will regard it as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit has shown that Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving downwards.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their constituents how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the strengthened sanctions do not affect Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult question of solving the problem through the use of military force.
This will have to be answered, for example, at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
Obama's only rustin is the fact that there are still three years left until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for him to work on a new strategy, in case it proves to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
High-ranking executive employees of US bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced this in response to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 chief executives will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell for five years.
Shares may be withdrawn from management in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort to link rewards with long-term performance at Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the global meaning that needs to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs Bank became the target of criticism after setting itself aside almost $17 billion for bonuses over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the onset of the financial crisis, the high premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced Wednesday that it intended to allocate a one-time tax of fifty percent on bankers' bonuses in excess of £25.000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics
It is five women, a record number, who today received in Stockholm the Nobel Prizes in technical disciplines and literature from the King of Sweden, Charles XVI Gustave.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The Chemistry Award was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with fellow countryman Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each recipient received the degree, Nobel Medal and Certificate of Acquisition of the pecuniary award.
This totals 10 million Swedish kroner in each category. (approximately €1.1 million)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward among themselves.
The much-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been presented this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward, since he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the defence of his policy he added that in certain situations war is essential for achieving peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive finance minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who weighs his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda for their Friday meeting.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further deepens the public finance crisis.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation which is going to be subject to Klaus' signature, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion kroons.
Nevertheless, on Wednesday the Chamber of Deputies validated the left's proposals for money transfers and increased the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of the Social Democrats for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, which cast doubt on the future of Fischer's cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the SDO, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics claim that the budget, as voted by Members, removes the package of savings measures passed by Fischer's government and which, in his view, must contain the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but is not obliged to do so, said today at a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs, that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irrefrensible deficit" of public finances.
Now there is, in his view, no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if it could rely on a consensus of wider political parties, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said the budget is staggering and the government should question its future existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "dramatic verdicts".
The leader of the ČSSD JiĆ Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government is frightening and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday already, the ČSSD called the ratification of the state budget for the next year a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film
Despite criticism of the fact that leading roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that Hollywood's new film Invictus - Undefeated will expose to the world many things about the country, its fights and victories.
History speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American Oscar-winning actor, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said, it was an ninety-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said to him, "If I have to play you, I should be able to see you personally..
The seventy-two-year-old actor who has been awarded an award for his role in Clint Eastwood's Milion Dollar Baby drama in the middle of boxing has, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery which has become a slave himself, a fictional US president, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone who is still alive and as important to so many people as Mandela is.
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work in support of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and it is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. Newly elected President Mandela knows that his country remains still and always divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually advance to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela's story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role in such a way as to bring it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I get your energy back, it is transmitted and I felt like I know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I rang at the door of the house, it opened to me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the differences between actors and real models, Invictus under the leadership of director Eastwood received positive opinions and we even talk about ambitions for the Oscars.
Film reviewer Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety newspaper summed up his appreciation in the words: "It's a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews at rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive ratings.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that it tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket near the Norwegian borders.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the Bulava missile, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually became the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she damaged herself in the middle of the flight.
Russian newspapers talk about "Bulava" as a "missile that doesn't steal"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th trial was normally conducted at the beginning.
It was not until the end of the flight that the aircraft was damaged again.
It was obviously the engine of the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew off the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can just be set on fire from a moving and submerged boat
This is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably caused by a defective "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket resisted and the damage touched only the third.
In previous cases, engine failures occurred on the first stage.
Although none of the test launches occurred without a hitch, the Department of Defence management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and they therefore still claim that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will carry even ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at age 51
Legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will run again in a professional match at age 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will help his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his entry already in Friday's match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is for the time being the president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have some details about the form, says club coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It was not specified whether the legendary hockey player's comeback would concern only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford and got 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he won twice the gold at the Olympic Games, seven world champion titles, he triumphed at the Canada Cup as well as at the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in NHL where twice he held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai listened to the unions and canceled all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai factory confirmed this.
However, management still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday worked this year again.
We can't give up our production plan, it's essential, that's why volunteer overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19 knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The website Sedmička.cz indicated that the company offered a Czech 400 kroon bonus to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can put on a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their holidays at the end of the year indicated Vaněk.
In addition to this, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transportation costs and lunch.
Given the fact that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the union's comments and demands as employees who spontaneously ceased production last week, management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, employees at the car factory were forced to work almost every day two extra hours in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the car factory and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the state of strike in case of agreement on their claims and signing of a common document.
The situation in the factory peaked last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of unceasing overtime.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and so-called hazing.
The management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work in addition to meet the requirements for the production of automobiles.
During the announcement of the strike on Monday, the unions also asked that employees who have ceased production should not be subject to any sanctions.
The unions ask the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a reward of 5,000 crowns (about €209) for these.
The Hyundai car factory in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
She started serial production last year in November.
It manufactured about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, having a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "hardening" HIV viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists are testing new combinations that can slow down the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also affects viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality takes precedence, in some cases, over the fact that the combination does not act so intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
However, the lives of patients can be radically extended through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
However, there are a number of side effects associated with their use.
Moreover, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what are called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to a way of dealing with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are an assemblage of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bonds on virus proteins.
Metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by boron, hydrogen, and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is indispensable to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the journal Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic link, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases was tested in test pieces as well as on its resistant variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical drugs, but it does not weaken on resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations to examine further in order to move towards the development of effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína Žezрусскийová, Director of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The SDO is attacking Fischer, who defends himself.
The president of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek called the budget ratified "flashing" for the following year and according to him, Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should question its existence.
The Prime Minister described the SDO's statements as a drastic verdict.
He says he's taking time to analyze.
SDO spokesman Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, the SDO and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether to support the minority in the Chamber of Deputies who are concerned about fighting the growing deficit, or whether to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the SDO and the social democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
On Wednesday, the Chamber of Deputies ratified the 2010 budget, however, with proposals for amendments amounting to 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The House has increased money for civil servants' salaries, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's complaint about the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of DKr 163 billion.
The SDO left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that a modified budget is a less bad alternative than an interim budget.
Deception and usefulness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of uselessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will still reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to resign in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation might be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment Monday with the Prime Minister after his visit to the government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering whether he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who imposed the changes in the budget, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws that increase the deficit, such as those that affect health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the SDO are not involved.
It's the business of the head of government Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the SDO did nothing detrimental, Topolánek pointed out in a text release from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries are calling for TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the amount of the public finances deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the democrats.
I haven't thought about it and once it's on the agenda, I'll focus on it," said Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected to the government by the Democrats from the House.
Prime Minister Fischer took off in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The SDO reversed the Prime Minister's request.
Nečas pointed out at the same time that the SDO would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked the Democrats to allow the budget to be voted on.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not small children, did he react to the question of whether the SDO had not been criticized by the President of the Party in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have been missed.
I already knew at the time I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolshevisation of the House and a destruction of everything positive, Topolánek responded in person.
According to the new schedules of the ČD there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will abolish or limit from 13 December certain less loaded express or regional trains and will strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will fall by two per cent on the day of entry into force of the new timetables compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic and reduced tariffs.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest reduction in transport concerns the Hradec Králové region by a total of eight per cent, while Prague and its surroundings can welcome an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the traffic of a few express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to just a few days a week.
Among the greatest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague Main Station (Praha Hlavní nádraí).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart in two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
This year's invoice for the regional railways is an additional SEK 200 million.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Railways next year a total of four billion kroons to pay for the visible losses, which is the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate to the amount of almost three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a ten-year contract, so far the duration was still one year.
Railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they did not use a price increase for the vast majority of transport tickets.
The changes will affect only ČD Net day tickets and eLiška discounted internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroons.
The price of eLiška will depend on the route travelled, while until then it was valid between cities of a region of choice and was at a single price of 160 kroons.
Philippine rebels still detain more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels today abducted 75 people south of the Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed, but who originally spoke of only 65 hostages.
All 17 children were released after eight o'clock, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields during a leak to the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police initially prosecuted the kidnappers following violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in Maguindanao province in the southern Philippines due to a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of November 23 related to the elections of the governor's administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of that province of the South Philippines was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, along with his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential lineage of the Ampatuan.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
South Africa's history concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman a.k.a. Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in American theaters in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates part of the life of former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody it.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was awarded to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theatres, feedback from critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
By his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, in 1993 he then received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes since it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full preparation for the football World Cup, and because the media are agitated by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are currently quite positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations about the main roles where Hollywood stars "pavant".
Morgan Freeman is, however, proud of the film in his own words.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and I have prepared myself well.
I have also met with Nelson Mandela personally many times in order to be able - as they say - to recover his energy, he said at the film's official premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember through the film Mandela's personality and message.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual added.
Wearing the National Rugby Team jersey
The film based on the story of British writer John Carlin's novel was freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave his creation to the people portrayed the South African human rights defender during his tenure as president.
Morgan Freeman thus tried during the film to regroup two racial groups from a long-divided population and as did Nelson Mandela in 1995 he entered dressed in the national jersey of the South African team on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won at the time.
For showing up on the lawn in jersey, which is considered in South Africa to be something sacred, Mandela had been long ovationated fourteen years ago mainly from the white public and was recognized by the white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in uniting people again into a single nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only "black" on the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
South African whites are skeptical, however, as recently stated in an interview with LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of wreaths in flames in the region of Louny
A fire in the morning engulfed a transformer of the company Čeps from the distribution center near the commune of Vókov na Lounsku.
According to Ústí Fire Department spokesman Lukř Marvan, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer burn, but they reviewed their advice and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the Pavla Mandátova company spokesman the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission set.
The damage is estimated at some tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
She added that in ten years of activity, Čeps had experienced nothing similar and that incidents of this type were isolated.
Electricity supplies have not been interrupted, says ČEZ's spokesperson for the Northern Bohemian Soża Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator of 400 kV and 220 kV transmission sets and power lines in the Czech Republic.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transmission sets to distribution sets and lines of 4339 kilometres in length.
Jančura to file libel suit against three ČSSD prefects
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, is today filing a complaint for defamation against three Social Democratic Prefects.
And concretely against Michal Hašek of the Southern Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesařk.
Jančura indicated it in Radiožurnál's Dvacet minut.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain areas.
However, all regions concluded long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and claim that we're making fine mouths, while we've only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
It's in exchange for slander on the Student Agency company, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he indicated that he had evidence that no region had proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for this to the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr Jančura's complaint is the continuation of his media show which serves him as a free publicity for his company and for his person.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he will interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he intends to take it back after New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption in a broad sense.
Jančura started his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of rail links for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing a tender.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to threats in Jančura from a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licences.
He ran as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is, but I won't say his name," Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voices are already rising, saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The pharmaceutical institute is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines to be paid by health insurance.
Specialists also see clarity in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for the children of August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal disease.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you'll have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year already a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
Yet parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for a dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that every year health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 kroons in doses of vaccine.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
Up to now, the State has spent about DKr 500,000 a year on all child immunization.
Reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcal infections cause inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
Hospital investigations indicate that there are up to 28 deaths of children under the age of 10 due to pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible obligation to vaccinate in the future.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský said mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to have been able to impose this at least.
I think this is a direction that must now be followed, Kalovský said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are not considering it at all at the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeů.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society of Pediatricians, acknowledges that vaccination based on volunteerism has its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, one could envisage a decrease in vaccination renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional," says Cabrnochová.
Specialists predict that as of next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also a break because it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
This is, however, linked to the concerns of paediatric practitioners, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intent was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance, with physicians receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
However, some MEPs feared that this would allow insurance to "reduce the amount of health insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to pay them back.
It is estimated that paediatricians will need to invest nearly 40,000 kroons per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum theft"
Frank Frazetta's son, a recognized illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (£12 million) from his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police stated that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested as he loaded 90 paintings into his vehicle and a trailer.
According to her, Mr.Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the museum into the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr.Frazetta Senior, aged 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press (AP) news agency.
AP cited a police official that the young Mr.Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, said 52-year-old Mr.Frazetta Jr. claims to have been allowed by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denied giving such an authorization, said the agency.
Labour is defending the increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the tax increase and spending cuts announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by deferring his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted lightning by attacking low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, we can see a 0.5% increase in social insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public wages from 2011.
The wrath of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession for which they are not responsible and warned that "problems" were being announced.
The decline in social insurance – which will make it possible to get around GBP 3 billion a year – has made the world of businesses angry, because, according to him, it is a tax on jobs while the goal should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than GBP 20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PRINCIPAL ITEMS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will increase further by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall even more than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
The increase in corporate income tax for small corporations has been abandoned
Tax rebates on electric cars and wind turbines
Pension increase of 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, one person earning GBP 30,000 will lose GBP 90 per year and one person earning GBP 40,000 will lose GBP 190, while one person earning GBP 10,000 per year will earn GBP 110 more.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 led to "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would be on the first 5 % of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, refuted an increase in the tax and pointed out that a decrease in spending was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, and they will allow us to halve the deficit, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said that he was confident and that the growth of the economy would restart at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts of economic growth - which will influence the amount it will have to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while the borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Opportunity missed"
The Conservatives who will launch this Thursday a new publicity campaign warning against Labour's "debt crisis", said that the plan to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, eluding "cynically" difficult choices until after the elections - to be held in June 2010.
"They presented nothing meaningful about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Treasury Secretary of the Ghost Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
"Important announcements will be made after the elections, whoever wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, contrary to Tory's proposals that would result in a faster and larger deficit reduction.
But the Lib Dems claimed that money raised through higher taxes and lower spending would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "built on wind".
Nick Robinson, BBC political editor, claimed that the schedule of announcements - such as rising inflation for some disability benefits next April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor facing propaganda accusations, with money simply being recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is provided when people need it most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Fake budget"
Although ministers did not publish details of spending beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that restrictions on public spending would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Etudes Fiscales) stated that the Chancellor's figures in the future imply substantial reductions in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only postponed," said her Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been a false pre-budget report, markets are well aware of it."
FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid at a house in Sarghoda in eastern Punjab province, announced the American embassy in Pakistan, to the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether it was the same men who had been reported missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are being held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, FBI spokesman said the agency had been aware of the arrests and that she was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and if it is really the students who are missing," she said.
The Pakistan Embassy in Washington claimed that the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of them's uncle.
She said that the house was already being monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been laid against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters news agency, but said the United States should "work more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students had been reported missing from their homes by their families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuse"
In the past 20 years, human rights have been as poorly respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
The report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man quoted in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another stated that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its lack of respect for human rights.
The authorities have claimed that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the biggest public protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"Fause confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook networks' and protesting the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, in front of my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still in blood and half conscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the losing candidate for election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said that he was locked in a container with 75 other people, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary should establish a committee to investigate post-election disturbances and the government's response, but said that the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested over the past three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn the Bristol site into a track for competitions.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowborders competing for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park trail, a small springboard preceded a 100m long trail.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the top view of the track was beautiful but it was quite intimidating.
It is a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city shining below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowborders in the country - real talent," he added.
Awards have been awarded for the best voltiges - or figures made on the runway.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be abandoned to melting.
Always them and us.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French don't like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for about fifteen years and whose effects are still being felt today.
Bowen's latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious framework.
A good anthropologist, he wants not only to know what politicians and media are saying about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He is very good at listening to and reproducing the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim be married in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to obtain a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that are of concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They're not pushing the debate to the end.
Theconservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their fellow lawyers of a Sunni Purist Islam associated with Saudi Arabia who today make up a small part of Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wonders how much French politicians (and the intellectual elite so virulent guardian of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a "closeness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing sail in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a Thin Layer of Ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and policies of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were proving themselves by hunting the polar bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous aspiring 14 years old who had to fight only the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, captured while swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show brought together 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the size of a zoo is still usually one millionth of the surface area needed for an adult in freedom.The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to algae growing in its thick fur.

Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often looks back at the threat hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians on motorskis use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two nations of hunting that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating glimpse of what the future might be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither amospherists nor oceanographers can accurately relate the speed of change.
It's not about trying.
In late XIXth and early XXth, Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering trips gave the first information on the melting of the ice cap.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the changes in terrain under it.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but the bulk of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice-dependent system, formed by brackish water fillets pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, maybe it'll be our turn"
Marines, among the 6,000 people who laid crowns on the graves in Arlington
First class De'Angello Robinson, 19, made a seven-hour bus trip to lay a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on veterans' graves, in various sections of Arlington Cemetery Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery Ceremony.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honour of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who sacrificed themselves.
It is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Embedded in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the lawns and the extensive hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam War, as these are not as often visited as the new graves, said the organizers.
The mood was optimistic, as the children played and the couples stood by the hand, wearing the fresh pine crowns on the grey tombs.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Close by, there was silence on Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals were crying without hiding, others were praying, and families and friends were supporting each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others leaned to see the small black and white information cards, embedded in the wet earth for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears, on her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio and had driven eight hours to come to collect at Marine Gunnery Sergeant David Shane Spicer's grave, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget how free we are... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American national arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested a U.S. national who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, said the services of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, lead to the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how husbands are and is being followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but permits have always been denied.
The detention of an American national may increase tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration which pursues a "soft" approach in order to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by The New York Times on Friday night.
The new American policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country where an official's average salary is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for text messages or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors to the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who often wish to connect must communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few American prisoners in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that would be allowed in any other public company -- distributing mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch group, which recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his ill older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, as both countries begin to engage in a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization supposed to be preparing a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they hoped that this case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who are foaming the Internet in search of young radicalized men.
Investigators claimed they were hunting a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video website on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, the home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani secret service representative who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA's plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north-east, which have become a refuge for terrorism.
They were considered undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed himself on the condition that anonymity be maintained because of the confidentiality of the case.
The authorities' representative stated that the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary permits to enter al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- insists on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the United States intelligence services have given priority to infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of barrier guards, denying entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to U.S. targets and their propagandary value.
However Evan Kohlmann, an expert from the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups must also pay increasing attention, in recent years, to the choice of people they accept because the American secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow his recruitment model that so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen call for climate action
Tens of thousands of Protestants marched in the streets, here on Saturday, demanding more action on the climate from negotiators working in the city's Bella Convention Center convention hall.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings, downtown.
On this day when little happened during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city, deploying signs in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, stating 'The Earth says it has had enough'.
Several celebrities joined the protests, including Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said travelling to her mother's home country, Peru, opened her eyes to the heartbreaking problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change that is already happening."
That's one of the reasons why I decided to join the march -- to spread the word and appeal to leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella centre and said that they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella centre and said that they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in climate discussions, activists who wore black masks and clothes, lit several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were launching them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, then followed by "some large explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around TV screens to follow the walk, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the demonstrators have failed to awaken the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's climate representative.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "In fact, this is something I was not aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, stating "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful depending on the outlook.
It shows the interest of the general public and the various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they are disrupting negotiations or impairing the freedom of others."
Test results reveal persistent race differences
Last week's federal report on mathematics results brought good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the head schools, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are far more advanced in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between the results of African Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in WashingtonD.C. have increased, over the past two years, from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
African Americans' progress in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling only from one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overall view over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1) class, when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups increased over this period, the difference was only 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by group head of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean that we raised the aggregate by looking at the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that promotes equality in District education.
I don't jump in joy for one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (apparent Democrat), D.C. Board Member and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (Elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said the message of test results is that the city's middle schools (colleges) desperately need attention.
Really, you still want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what scares us is that we don't devote enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at pupils at the end of the elementary and early middle classes who did not integrate the basics of reading earlier in their school career and who are quite late compared to their peers.
Every day, the mathematics program, for Kindergarten (maternal) classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and experiences of real life, as they were set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply think we need to continue working to offer better interventions to these students at a lower level than that of the class, Rhee said.
Others felt that the results of the NAEP posed the question of whether Rhee could continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with lower results in order to narrow the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education trainer at the University of Berkeley, California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in Washington's poorest neighbourhoods.
Also, targeting can have political implications that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like other school superintendents, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We are focused on developing a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they come from, are assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the key elements in narrowing the pass gap was the length of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the Washington District, to compete with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "starting point" to get another increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise of the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descends and blinks for a moment at the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students from the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of an impressed new student than enthusiastic.
That's where I'm going to study! Graciela exclaimed who would like to study medicine, as the guide directed them to the entrance to the science building.
Youpi, really? she said thinking, when she was told the low ratio of law teacher to student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you are going to college:
The question is where.
Although this is still largely a question for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who have left high school where they became parents in adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one out of every five Hispanic "second generation" pursues high school education -- a notable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success is important, researchers say, they pave the way for future generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study the winners claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many parents also set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her reach university -- particularly if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, won't help them," said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about offering a support network to these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepared for you), it provides over $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been attended by more than 10 million students, with over 60 percent entering university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil secures agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its struggling infrastructure during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry, which has been invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
The US companies returned with a stake in only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who put in an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies were awarded contracts for auctioned fields in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies have paved the way," said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an Internet news site.
It will take a long time for another offer to be made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as US military troops retreated, have slowed down US oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, analysts say.
U.S. companies were, in some cases, at a disadvantage due to their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they were not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The largest American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided technical advice, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more bid on contracts than other companies and has gone back with significant stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The pre-selected auction companies made bids that were then compared to the per barrel rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the main al-Qaida organizers was reportedly killed in Pakistan.
It appears that an American missile, having struck along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, declared on Friday US counter-intelligence authorities.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles thrown into their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah, North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the area.
Local authorities claimed that the missiles had been fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan's anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a Pakistani civilian secret service member, speaking on Miran Shah's phone.
The authorities said that the local suspected activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the "completely shredded bodies".
It was totally impossible for the local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but both U.S. anti-terrorist representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as one of the Al-Qaida military organizers who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to keep anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy to attack the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic direction of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority said that Somali had made rapid progress in the ranks of al-Qaida's and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the American general public, but it does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major al-Qaida figure or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures put forward by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, says the site.
United Nations Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
The UN Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate tainted by allegations of widespread corruption during the UN-backed presidential elections.
Eide's departure came as the Obama administration decided to send an additional 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States' schedule for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and that would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community," Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but would simply honour his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives stated that the name Staffan di Mistura had been quoted; he was a citizen of Italo-Switzerland who had recently chaired a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who had previously led United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but stated that Galbraith's accusations -- which were thanked -- "were detrimental to the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism about international observation of elections."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of United States forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than the mission in Afghanistan has been assigned, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration about the limitations of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy UN hiring regulations hampered his ability to bring new talent.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran needs additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world's major powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran due to its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a floor of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week-long visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, decried the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a conclusion. ̈
One of the things that weighs me most is that if I have learned something in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable side inherent in war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He said that a "set of motivations and punishments" might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be in worse security with nuclear weapons" as "his people would suffer enormously" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experiment solely for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon a significant portion of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for the desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a way to build trust on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has appeared to have moved away from attempts at agreement - in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, Iran's raid on some of the proposals of the international community for which they had in fact agreed in early October, prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in what they had not envisaged, in terms of significant additional sanctions against Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set 31 December as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turned to other options, including the pursuit of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "enhanced sanctions".
In a statement made on Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "unsubstantiated allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and affirmed its agreement to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the rich oil region of Kurdish to meet the Troops Leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly regarding borders, property rights and income-sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the Kurds' anxiety about the pending withdrawal. U.S. authorities quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you."
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by posters of propaganda sermons, "Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "An extra baby, it's an extra grave".
They learned so well that the authorities of the Shanghai Government, alarmed by the low birth rate of their city and by the ageing population, changed radically this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no second left, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources and who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child policy in China, creating two generations of single children notoriously with good cheeks and spoils, nicknamed the "little emperors", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple to six when the policy was implemented.
The population distribution, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the resident population registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a lack of labour in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive mitigation
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is, without a doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may face colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have given the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the execution of this policy.
In rural areas, some government officials forced pregnant women with a second child to have an abortion.
In addition, many couples resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys to girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the single child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for urban residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that central government authorities recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city's government has sent family planners and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and slip flyers under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the family planning officer, the response was disappointing.
Dissatisfactory response
Although officials in a rural town in the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in applications for couples wishing a second child after the campaign's launch, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, claim that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in Caolu Municipality of Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and the life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly regard the policy of the single child as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It's true, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she wanted only one child because she was one herself. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone take care of us."
We don't usually take care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42, and owner of a translation company says it more severely.
For couples working with two, middle class, who lower the birth rate, he says, one must be selfish to succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 grew up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and do not want to have that lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even one child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there's space issues -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child's only 9 months old, you need to write his or her resume to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations group has draft emission reduction plans
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- has returned to the spotlight on Friday, due to the release of a paper highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden, in the next few years.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as it has led the way.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the time-consuming negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Drafted by a UN ad hoc working group, the text does not say how rich countries would give to the poor to support global warming, both in the short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Sierra Club's Washington Representative.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the paper, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN Executive Secretary-General on Climate Change, Yvo de Boer, described as being "the complete picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, over the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and droughts or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, United States Representative on Climate Negotiations, rejected any discussion that required the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared to the voluntary efforts of the major emerging economies, if not financed by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is getting harder on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the major developing countries, says Stern, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said that the US main negotiator, either lacked "good sense", or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the US would not financially help China to fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than rescuing the planet, with China and the United States arguing about their respective obligations, while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives of acting more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the main powers are fighting to find out who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries, which are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change, have indicated that they will continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say that negotiations will lead at least to political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, drafted a proposal for a 24-page treaty, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the Climate Unit of the European Commission, said that the action of the small island states has "put political pressure on the entire political process", partly because they are now unified and they are asking emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The discussions became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Minister of the Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister got off their plane and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend in camera meetings and information conferences, in order to be able to make claims that will be studied during the following week.
The real image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the convention hall every day -- guitar player activists present night shows mocking countries that they believe are betraying and proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 Heads of Government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of the greats," said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy at Conservation International.
The heavy goods vehicles are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday's syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will blow through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed commuter train will reach 225 km/h, as it runs from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin commuter train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and will connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The small holes lost will become thriving suburban cities, business travel times will be much shorter and the passage of the plane and car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the £10 billion needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental dangers could slow down British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to make a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a larger, northbound high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will travel to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch going west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another going northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option' said a rail professional.
When this is over, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour trip currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains 400m long and capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts state that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes that the project should proceed, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be required to travel off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, maintaining travel times between London and Scotland of more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a transition from aircraft to trains, a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay GBP 75,000 loan for Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the main member of Parliament Tory, had the taxpayer pay thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orangery he built in his constituency house.
The party leader who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that the members of parliament were "maintained", increased his loan by GBP 75.000 to build an oak extension to his second house, in Rutland.
He had been allowed to charge the taxpayer for the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month.
The commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carries out a control of members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan stated that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The nearby houses were sold for nearly £1 million.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office states that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on Privileges and Standards of the Commons, concerning its pre-borrowing arrangements.
The Committee acquitted him last month of any charges of non-compliance, after an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal certainty of borrowing GBP 271,406 from his London property at the house of his constituency which he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan was claiming around GBP 1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March of last year.
In April, its requests increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the GBP 75,000 loan.
The RBS variable standard interest rate increased from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication by the authorities of the Commons shows that Mr Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1.250 in May.
Duncan lost his position as Head of the Ghost Cabinet in September, after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed him stating that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated as "de la m...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and I asked for a small part, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for more, but I didn't."
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former post as an oil trader, began to have to explain his expenses, in May, after it appeared that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the expense bureau that it "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a £-shaped hole in Duncan's lawn, to protest after it was revealed that he had asked for £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Duncan said: "It was for major improvements, approved both by the expense office and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of stealing or developing or using rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn't be sharper or simpler."
Faithful, come and see the Calendar of Brighton Advent
Brighton Beach Cabins found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabins for each December day, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., each day, with free pâtés and hot wine.
Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the booth presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant in Hove, is an unpaid priest from the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should get closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
"The idea of the Advent calendar of the beach cabin came right after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for climate change
Tens of thousands of people marched on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where the police carried out several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, about one hundred thousand according to the organisers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, to reach an agreement by Friday which could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization on climate around the world, illustrated by these events, helped to make the "political prize" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
Incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the march, when a group of 300 demonstrators, entirely dressed in black, broke windows with cobblestones and hammers, a journalist from the AFP found.
Riot control officers immediately intervened unreservedly.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to them members of the "Blacks Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that had notably distinguished themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organisers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", pointing out that about 100 of them "were still held in the street on Saturday night "tweet and held in sitting position despite the extreme cold".
Part of Parliament, the procession, rather good child, took over the direction of the Bella Center, the site of the negotiations.
Protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building, without seeking to enter it.
A stage had been set up to welcome the expected speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of protesters had come by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoats, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue pools" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are going down the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep thinking: we have time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying out in Africa, rivers where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement came closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of globalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen for "the link between climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, wearing bandanas boasting of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, rallies of a few hundred protesters have also been held to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow recognised this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "thing".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
Polls closed at 5:00 PM GMT.
The turnout was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheyl Saakashvili, "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating itself from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which left several thousand dead, Abkhazia seeks to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a nice white building with some palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential elections in this region with sumptuous landscapes on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed all over this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed Russian officials who had come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said in a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, answered Alexey Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, by raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements reached with Moscow last year, such as that transferring to Russia control over the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims to support neither the current power nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be held within two weeks.
Climate: protests around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched on Saturday around the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the alert, arrested nearly 700 people in the margins of a massive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, about one hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliamentary party, the procession, generally a good child, took over the direction of the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
Protesters stopped about 500 metres from the centre, without seeking to enter.
A stage had been set up to welcome the expected speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the procession left, a group of a few hundred demonstrators, entirely dressed in black, fitted with bricks and hammers, broke windows, a journalist from the AFP observed.
Riot control officers immediately surrounded them and intervened indiscriminately, throwing several of them on the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that had notably distinguished themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of some 20 people, according to police.
We are watching the extremist groups, had warned the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces were turning in the sky.
The majority of the demonstrators, who came by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoats, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue pools" for "justice for the climate".

French MEP José Bové, a figure of globalism, told the AFP that he had come to Copenhagen for "the link between climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam has mobilized a number of personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched the protests.

The history-geo emerges strengthened from the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
National Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD Sunday that history and geography emerged "reinforced" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in scientific seniority.
From now on, first graders will all have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the minister, "we have to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S stream is no longer a scientific stream" but "in essence, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L streams cannot remain sub-lines of the S, he continues, stressing further: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals either indignant about the absence of senior history-geography in technological high schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) disapprove of the government's plan to remove compulsory education from senior S history-geography.Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some elected right-wing ones.
On the other hand, the minister added that there was "no question" of abolishing the philosophy of the S-leaving program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization Tuesday to protest against the project, which they believe sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will focus on their discipline, then at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will also take courses in situation during the year of M2 and then be a first year in front of students as trainee teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister said that he would propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the plan to abolish the school card "by 2012".
A Normal Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince on the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure de la rue d'Ulm, met on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a series of speeches by experts, of fifteen minutes each, filmed and open to the public, noted a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more," said 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this day, who takes his name from the one given by the students to the fish in the school basin.
Some 20 stakeholders were selected from among the experts in their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
On the subject of global warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes", told AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes, but with the help of graphics, in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the listeners will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
The videos from these lectures will be posted online on the school's website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Late payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
Unions of prison guards called Friday for "general mobility" to demand payment by the end of the year holidays of bonuses and overtime whose payment was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd supervisory union) asked staff who will not be on duty to demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them", in order to "disclaim the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd trade union) calls on them "to meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", deeming "honest and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "extra hours, night bonuses, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first supervisory union, the Federal Autonomous Union of Penitentiaries (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for the general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were budgeted, but ensure that the remaining amounts will be paid in January.
The Chancellery indicated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the supervisory unions guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am not unaware of the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I have asked the management of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation, which is the result of a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours, does not happen again in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be meagre, except for the management staff benefiting from the famous bonuses of functions and objectives, lamented the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budget constraints have good back".
It is a pure scandal, outraged the interregional FO union of Marseilles, announcing its decision to boycott until further order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, idem for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff money, the CGT-penitentiary of Bordeaux believes.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less well off than others.
But in any case the account is not there, noted the general secretary of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he's offering more "nice tricks" than the ones he's getting.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, told the "popess" of the little Oprah Winfrey screen that he had a simple gift rule: "I give things more fun than I get."
As part of a special show to be broadcast on ABC Sunday night, President and his wife Michelle provide insight into how they intend to celebrate the end of the year celebrations in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be part of the game.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show aired in advance.
And Michelle Obama went wrong against her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he receives: "Surely not, I gave you nice gifts last year," she teased the president.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before humorously replying by pointing at the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who offered you this?".
During this one-hour show, in a relaxed atmosphere, with the famous host who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama evoked a 10-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember that time when I met my dad came to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball, said the president.
It was only much later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange it around the fireplace, but I loved that little doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operatived, RTL claims he's in an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-opted to Los Angeles due to major "lesions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-opted on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors had found "lesions resulting from the operation" of the hernia disc suffered in Paris on 26 November, told Paris his press department, stating that these injuries needed "a restorative operation".
However, the singer's press service was reassured that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical report would be issued no later than 48 hours from now.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was however plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he has opened an eye, RTL adds.
When asked by the AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" no drain would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park International Clinic for this herniated disc.
The surgery, scheduled for several days, had been performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux , a doctor well known in the artistic world.
This one was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL's information.
Following the operation he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, for an infection following the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, estimated on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but assured himself "no worries" for the rocker, who is "a fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because doing twelve hours of flying after such an operation is not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, had wanted to be reassuring, claiming that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "scapped".
Mr. Camus also stated that he spoke with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and did not notice any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated on by a "small colon cancer" and then by a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed the singer's difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: Bousquet's premiere on its fetish distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medallist at the 2009 World Championships in the Great Basin, won an international title on Thursday over a distance he particularly likes, the 50 m freestyle, during the Euro-2009 in the Small Basin in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are last allowed saw only three world records beaten as we waited for a rush.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relay gentlemen 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, who languished on the world record of the 50 m free, of which he holds the mark in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50m free, it was the 28-year-old Frenchman who won in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet outpaced Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had envisaged.
One can always dream better and in this case, I had said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from 1 January.
At the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of combinations was not used this time by the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the big pool this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the mark he holds over 400 m freestyle (3:32.77) but nevertheless won by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself a damn about this race.
I knew I couldn't break a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: one sarcophagus panel owned by Zola awarded USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging in particular to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded Thursday, $1.5 million, significantly above its estimate, announced the art dealer Sotheby's.
This front panel, two meters long by 63 cm high, dating from the third century A.D., was estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world", explained to the AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice-president of the Roman and Egyptian antique art auction at Sotheby's.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still underway but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have most bid so far, told the AFP a spokesperson for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained in Rome for nearly 300 years in the famous Borghese family collection, then appeared successively at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bathtub in his Parisian mansion, and at Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before Marshal Pétain took power.
Remained a shaded area of about fifty years old.
While searching the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this sign was part of an "Emile Zola Succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Attempted aborted departure from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico considered that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the fallen President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was refused a safe-conduct by the putschist government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for carrying out this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arriving in El Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya, the Mexican government's plane returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migrations.
The putschist government wanted to force Mr Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad to grant him a safe ride.
But the fallen president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as a guest head of state in office.
The putschist government "has experienced a further failure in wanting me to resign (...), they wanted me to resign", said Thursday Mr Zelaya on Globo radio, on which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some chords the fallen president, refugee at the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican Embassy has submitted a request for safe driving, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, said on Wednesday the interior minister of the putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, on Honduran radio HRN.
I am not seeking asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to take place as President of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumours of Zelaya's departure on Wednesday had mobilized supporters of the fallen president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military reinforced their siege.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginality of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan socialist president Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, the day he had organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he had returned by surprise on 21 September and had taken refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he goes out, he will be arrested to answer for the crime of "high treason" accused of by justice, according to the putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Mr Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on 27 January.
Wall Street goes up, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up rising on Thursday, with US trade balance figures testifying to the recovery in activity both from the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, technologically dominant, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index awarded it 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But it remains anecdotal, she tempered, considering that the market focused on "half-full glass".
According to Avalon Partners' Peter Cardillo, investors concentrated on US trade balance figures, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The U.S. trade deficit fell in October by 7.6% compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
In contrast, analysts expected a widening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States increased against all odds last week, reaching 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest level in a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market's down.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury Bill increased to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night and the yield of the 30-year coupon to 4.492% against 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of power consummate the "Ladies in white"
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government on Thursday consumed wives of political detainees gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which about ten dissidents were arrested.
About 40 "Ladies in white", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were consumed in the streets by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they marched towards the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP said.
Down the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Vive Fidel and Raul!" chanted, with his fist raised, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes agents who came "to ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havanese neighbourhood of Vedado, about ten dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for International Human Rights Day were arrested by plainclothes policemen, a journalist of the AFP noted.
The police forced dissidents who were consummated by government supporters into civilian vehicles, according to the journalist.
Interpellation of dissidents in similar circumstances usually lasts only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", a number of 200 according to dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a sentence of 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda is a member of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain under arrest.
The Cuban authorities regard the opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of flouting rights and freedoms, including expression.
Forced kills an octagenary with a knife and injured 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
A forceed man armed with two knives killed an octagenary and wounded five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of crowding on Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant allegedly struck with two knives and for unknown reasons, an octagenary, in or in front of a pharmacy at 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, was learned from police sources and witnesses.
Grievously wounded, the old man, born in 1929 according to a leader of the Alliance police union, died in hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, about thirty years old, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to hospital where the octogenarian succumbed.
The other injured person's days are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then suffered an ailment and was reportedly hospitalized "in shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He reportedly injured two passers-by, apparently at random: a thirty-year-old and a four-year-old, the latter seriously.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he wore in cross behind his back, explained on site a leader of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies gathered by the AFP, tried to master the force.
I saw a 30-year-old guy wearing a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, said Alberto, waiter of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Also boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal police officers, including their official, attempted to call on the armed man and were wounded with fists, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Bystanders came to tell me there was a person injured outside.
I went out, saw a 70-year-old on the ground, put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important wound to the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later a second person of about thirty years, wounded with a knife, arrived.
It was the National Police that arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office has referred the investigation to the Hauts-de-Seine Judicial Police Department (SDPJ 92).
Forced man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in custody.
A police source hasn't ruled out that he's in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the police station in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" as "all the forced of this species whose forces increase tenfold under the effect of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the prosecution to be dropped
Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski's lawyer again demanded, on Thursday, in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), that the prosecution of his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a matter of more than 30 years of morality, be dropped.
Chad Hummel, the director's lawyer for the "Pianist", denounced before three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeal serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
I call for the charges to be dropped here and now, said Mr Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "were cold behind the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who had since died -- had discussed, before sentencing, with a prosecutor who had told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which was a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), by the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally stated at the end of September that he had "mented" the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to drop the proceedings, Mr. Hummel requested a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of charges could be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled the United States in 1978, prior to sentencing, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old girl.
He's never set foot in the United States since.
Los Angeles County Deputy Attorney Phyllis Asayama, for example, said Roman Polanski "must be there to appear at the hearing".
In this case, is it possible to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "requests a favor from the court, while disregarding her authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also pointed out that "there are other alternatives to flight."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one who called for the prosecution of Roman Polanski to be dropped.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also called once again for an end to the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being harassed at every turn of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends up directionless, restrained by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended up without direction on Friday, in a market truncated between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, noted Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains within narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think that will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped to improve the market's opinion on the robustness of the economic recovery", summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
U.S. consumer confidence also recovered significantly in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to preliminary estimates from the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were slowed down by a further rise in the dollar, at the highest in the last two months against the euro, which "pushes down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market's down.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury Bill increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday night and the yield of the 30-year coupon to 4.497% compared to 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World once again in South Africa
After a month of journeying through South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are about to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great Mass of Beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Sports Miss or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a veritable whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I have seen so many things and lived so many experiences!, exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience has been fascinating.
I am pleased to have experienced it twice, stresses Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the warmth of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of " breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Misses now focus on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both becoming Bollywood stars.
It's every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launches Miss India with a large smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
Candidates will parade in traditional costume and of course in swimwear.
The show will be hosted by a TV presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a head of the Miss World Steve Douglas committee.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
As last year, the candidates made a safari, visited Soweto's famous township, but this time by bike, and tasted local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma who shook their hand.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their greatest memory will undoubtedly remain the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup football, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been with people I never thought I could get close.
I will undoubtedly come back for the 2010 World Cup, enthusiasm Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive", according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," assured his son David on Friday upon his arrival at the Los Angeles airport where he was to go to his father's bedside hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it's going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he left the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1:00 pm local (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured that he would go "very quickly" to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma last night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a hernia disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be re-opted on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade is educated, to attend a school show, noted a photographer from the AFP.
The chief of orthopaedic and trauma surgery at the Hospital of the Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer violently questioned Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on November 26 at the International Clinic of Monceau Park in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, said Mr. Camus.
I've heard of a possible future court proceeding, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus felt that Johnny Hallyday had "departed far too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it surprised me, since I myself had two hernia discs, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "goed without drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic community.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resolve a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, repeatedly condemned by the courts, in medical liability cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" prosecuted "regularly" before the Order Council, and who is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention had "perfectly gone well" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the installation of a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF association raises the tone and makes the New Centre no longer use its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to OPA's attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardian party, calling on him to stop using it on any medium, on pain of legal proceedings.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the NC National Council.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP transferred to the NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand for being the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not intend to be dispossessed, came out of its silence to issue a formal notice to the minister and the deputy, urging them no longer to use the acronym and to pass on to them the property of the brand, on pain of prosecution.
In recent days, you have multiplied your statements indicating that you are going to propose to your political movement to take over + the UDF acronym, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it was right to forward on your militant material and on the cover page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New Center+, of the slogan +Today's UDF+, also notice the signatories of the mail.
As you are not unaware, you have no right to use this symbol, explains the UDF office which calls on the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as from (its) website".
He also asked Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of the mark to his legitimate successors in title".
If you did not do so, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, warn the signatories.
In their correspondence, they state that the UDF "has been a political movement in its own right since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave him in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continued, "when he filed the trade mark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
He takes scandalously and fraudulently advantage of the deposit abscence of the acronym UDF to perform it on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironing out on the NC's strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for itself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled".
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier to be tried for abuse of weakness
The Nanterre court decided Friday to try the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenary to deprive her of part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, an offence punishable by up to three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear each other apart while holding the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87, should be conducted collegiately by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre prosecutor's office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will be required to submit a report by March 10, 2010, stating in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she'll do it.
I'm going to talk to her, said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kijman, at the end of the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr.Banier) manipulated this elderly lady whom we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has brought criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist who she accuses of having taken advantage for years of her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a long-time friend.
While the court was due to consider the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers' case, the lawyers' pleadings sometimes turned into the great family unpacking on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Can you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her since her marriage."
For her part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office again held that the complainant was not entitled to take action, especially since a guardianship judge had refused in recent days to grant her request to initiate judicial protection proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to take legal action, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in its place," said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees, recalls the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of making employees adhere to "values" determined from above as it used to be, of imposing on consumers products designed by the technicians of the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering the markets to the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from customer preference factors returns regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to a mortific demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the part that emerges from a much more general phenomenon that affects managers in particular.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI "requires from all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires on the part of employees a commitment that the revenues of authoritarian management totally contradict.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put employees at the centre of the company's concerns on the same level as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – like the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all because I have been able to see that, in the face of a new situation, every structure finally manages, after many detours, to do primarily... what it has always done. !
- Second, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, out of intellectual comfort, the old Behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the United States "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "leviers" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reinforces the leaders in a posture of mechanistic governance, inappropriate to the world today.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes a finalist view of human behaviour.
It consists in incorporating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of realizing part of their dreams, ambitions, projects.
At present, only studies from the Motivational Analysis adopt this view of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, business managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and hand over their human resource management "to the place".
They thus create a favourable ground for the concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: "Just War" Worth Right-wing Praise to Obama
The U.S. right welcomed on Friday the speech delivered the previous day in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had lagged Obama's award on October 9, applauded the presidential speech this time, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice-president in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, the geriatric right wing of the Republican Party, in the US Daily Today, adding that she herself had addressed the topic of war "sometimes necessary" in her memoirs that have just been published.
War is of course the last thing in my opinion that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop these terrorists all over there, she felt.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done in Oslo "a very good job".
I found that the speech was really good, welcomed the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some sides, I found this speech quite historic, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" remind the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush, a re-converted columnist at the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke as an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it", Mr Gerson said.
Among the few on the right to be unconvinced, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "ternal, ampoule and uninspired" on the National Review Online site.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich alarmed that Barack Obama justified the use of force.
When one envelops war in the notion of justice, one can easily justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained laudable for the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel was prematurely awarded to Mr. Obama, called his speech "superproduction" even for an orator known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", has ignited the Californian daily.
Obama "made the right speech," the New York Times said, judging it "both dark and edifying".
Roads: three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three sessions of negotiations-marathon, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employers' organisation to have stayed until the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that put an end to the slogan of strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, which began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators had left in the early morning of Friday, with the hope of early signing at the end of the morning.
Even though three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took even more than six hours of a meeting begun at 11:00 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed at 6:00 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very detrimental to businesses" and "it was to be feared that it would disrupt the end-of-year holidays," said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low-wage earners, "we increase from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but we're going very far, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we're going to order our militants that there be no blockades, no blockade of supply centres.
But we can still have some recalcitrants that aren't happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, praised "a good deal", although it was "difficult to concede increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros monthly for the low salaries and 100 to 120 euros for the highest salaries.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs, and for the maintenance of general road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, in particular, address the question of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a 100 million euro reduction in employer's charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 draft amending finance law, which was adopted on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "in the same terms".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to be applied first to companies belonging to this organisation, and second, to the whole profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will take place "as soon as possible", assured Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dupes market", as the €100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate urgently, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the turkey eaters of the next New Year, lamented the Unostra.
For the Otre, the agreement risks "to dig the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
Disruptions on the RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday at the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and the management of the RATP left them on their hunger as to their demand for a bonus.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of shopping before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10am and 8pm, with one in two trains on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one in four trains off the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture, which will require passengers to switch trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which wait for 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is making efforts to serve department stores".
The RER A crosses from west to east of Paris.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains travelled during peak hours, and almost no trains were scheduled in off-peak hours.
Like Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, the Francilians having organized themselves.
In the early morning, Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station was much less frequented than usual, particularly because of the absence of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier, to be sure to arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare station did not experience saturation, indicated the SNCF, which had provided for the supervision of law enforcement officers and forces.
The RERs operated by SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left from Saint-Lazare train station to reach the metros.
New general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged "minor" by the unions, of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working hours, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, who demand a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, outraged the CGT, pointing out that the management "was not doomed to solve a problem while in the drivers and the SNCF it is done".
A further meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader examination of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", said RATP.
This also caused the unions to say that the company "did not care about weekend users".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a settlement committee at the Paris headquarters.
It was then that the management, which until then refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in the interests of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to expand to RER B on Tuesday, after advance notice is filed by Unsa and Independents.
The unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the daily million travelers.
The RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, receive from 2200 to 2700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros of bonuses, for off-the-shelf hours, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurdish party, a decision with far-reaching consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court declared on Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which had just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "home of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", the president of the Court Hasim Kiliç told the press, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to declare the dissolution, said Mr. Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party's cadres, including its President Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tuguk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Mrs. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as unlabeled parliamentarians.
The decision follows a procedure initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party assures that it has "no organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to describe it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict comes at a time when the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, in an attempt to undermine the Kurdish support for the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
DTP leaders had claimed that a dissolution could lead to an upsurge in tensions in south-eastern Anatolian, where numerous protests against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have escalated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
As soon as the court announced, a thousand demonstrators gathered outside the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large southeast city populated mostly by Kurds.
Law enforcement officers fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, as protesters threw molotov cocktails or stones, with fronds.
A hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk claimed that the Justice decision would "intensify despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (kurd, ed) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very harsh winter.
But the head of the road clearing and sandblasting service (FES) says that it is not to bother the citizens.
It is simply so that the agents can test the vehicle technique and learn how to master them.
And according to the meterologists, it might be for this weekend.
More than 300 officers and 120 vehicles stand ready to attack snow and ice.
Here the FES follows a very elaborate plan.
Mr Brauburger explains that as soon as he starts to snow on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, large sandblasting vehicles travel 20 main routes (known as routes A).
This includes busy streets, main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES officers begin duty at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with a well-attached road melter, within a maximum of 3 hours.
This is why the FES service starts at 3 a.m. "so that roads are cleared when daily migration traffic begins".
Where it gets harder, it's when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the head of the road clearing and sanding department "because no motorist is willing to let the salting vehicles pass".
Then, if it no longer snows, access roads and service roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße - are taken care of.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr Brauburger is well aware that this still causes a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES hiking team starts to clear priority areas deemed dangerous and crossings.
As for bike paths, FES services are generally unable to take care of them.
Mr Brauburger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the condition of the bridges between 10 and 4.30 p.m.
Since ice is formed very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
Police may also use this special service when needed.
The cradle of dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 metres long for 1.50m tall, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with sickle claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine reports, Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological features.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the supercontinent's landline, the Pangea and was towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of the early dinosaurs.
Indeed, he informs us about the family ties, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
In 2006, Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History of Utah and member of the excavation team tells that they sometimes find a dozen bones in one day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the early evolution of dinosaurs.
Researchers named it after Tawa after the word of the Hopi Indians for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a truly exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of incomplete bones.
Not all experts in paleontology share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he points out that it can confirm some theories about the early evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the very first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, at what time the Saurians were divided into three major evolutionary groups: the theropods (carnivores) which include the later tyrannosaure and the velociraptor, from which the birds, the sauropods, quadrupeds on the long neck, and those related to them and the ornithische herbivores of which species such as triceratops and stegosaure are part.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species presents an interesting report of characteristics that are both primitive and developed, called S. Nesbitt.
Researchers found evidence that Tawa hallae had small aerial bags in its bones at the skull level, as did the birds that are the descendants of the theropods.
These small pockets of air make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It appears that in Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small aerial bags in its bones.
Since the related lineage of the huge sauropods also possessed aerial bags and a light frame, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive known dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers concluded that the Saurians had appeared there.
As a result, the three major evolutionary lines split and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e., the whole of the land that formed the Pangea supercontinent.
This appears to be confirmed by the fact that the paleontologists team also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, the researchers advance.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of Science Studies magazine said there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says there is an even older species, silesaure, which lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him this could give a wrong view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while there are virtually no fossils on other continents.
On the other hand, how did dinosaurs become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era when they originated from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the current crocodiles and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Trias dinosaurs spread all over the planet thus favoring the development of many new species while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a massive extinction that dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or the dinosaurs were better suited, so they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favorite meteorite flourishing from a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and which since that time had been vegetating in the shadows: these were mammals.
Vienna Solidarity in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
There are lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec City, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the casino at Frankfurt's J.W. Goethe University is making waves all over the planet.
278 professors and teachers from J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protestant students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English they condemn the intervention of the police demanded by the university's steering committee.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers on strike after walls and works of art had been painted with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories consider that the degradations did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commando against students and teachers who had organised their own courses".
Evacuation represents an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and teaching.
Focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and attempts to make the reasons for the mobilization forget.
As a result, the University's Steering Committee has evaded the debates that would be indispensable.
Court officers require that criminal proceedings be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not participate in the degradations.
Legitimation of protests
The young people of the Verdi trade union in the service sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
Protests are only a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Verdi Union's Regional Youth Secretary.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took the case for the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday on the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU MP from the Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The SPD opposition parliamentary groups, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU uses the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Link)
Instead of reflecting on the students' arguments and demands, they are evacuated.
The Left Party has tabled a motion that requires the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions for police intervention.
The new "Silicon-valley"
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of search for secret weapons, under strict surveillance.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet "Silicon Valley".
There are important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics.
As early as September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd established links with Riedberg, a place of the Francfortian sciences – with the academic institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Protocol of close collaboration".
The signatories were Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz, Head of Project Section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the expanding Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies want contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
There are the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnics, the major companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") takes its name from the wooded hills at the heart of which the research centres are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed high enough.
For his supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg into hopeless chaos of construction sites for about ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The head-end stations, with tracks ending in the middle of the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of 19th-century transportation technology that acted as a brake shoe for modern rail traffic as it once took a long time to get the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that's what you have to do.
That's why the head-end stations have to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train crossing station, which is about halfway on the Trans-European Railway Magistral between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
Implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, the head-end stations no longer pose any real problems of entry and exit since there are modern, reversible trains with railcars and pilot car at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and communal policies prevailed.
The railway company is of the part because, it is the taxpayer who bears the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From the urban point of view, this project is relatively justified.
We get an urban space that – according to the graphs of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the widening of the section are designed for a traffic of people to which one attributed - and it is typical of the 80s - a huge growth.
At the time there was still no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on increasing freight traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than trucking on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabian project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other junction points and congestion in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport mentions a total of sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the widening of the section through the Rhine Valley by 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to press the fungus here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking hoof.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of international freight traffic in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews judgment on airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government raised the possibility of appealing the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Court concerning the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to examine from a legal point of view the judgement of the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document of more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Court of First Instance had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights in the event of the planned construction of the north-west tarnishing runway at Frankfurt airport.
The authorisation to land 17 aircraft between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air pollution.
The coalition must have decided by 4 January if it wishes to appeal the judgement in cassation.
The opposition criticises this delay and tries to put pressure on the government representative to appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections, which consisted in banning night flights. Otherwise, this will be condidrated as a total failure to speak a given word.
It is damn hard to be allowed to keep his word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's election slogan "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's criticism that the Land government is still trying to allow night flights by using "avocasserie et de rublardises".
It takes time to conduct a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "fast first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of its fraction's statements on the ban on night flights is completely flawed.
US banks repay aid
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, are untied of their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (over 30 billion Euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
U.S. television channel CNBC indicated in a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid received.
Banking institutions thus seek to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the sums, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to managers as well as the payment of higher fees.
The Bank of America launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors, which earned it $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the sum comes from the bank's cash pools which are well-filled thanks to the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, Managing Director of the Bank of America, expressly thanked the American taxpayers: the capital injection has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution assumed its capacity by buying Merrill Lynch investment bank at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to obtain money on the financial markets in order to free itself from the tutelage of the state.
The U.S. bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase on Thursday, reported the CNBC channel citing the banking community.
The Citigroup spokesperson did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, Goldman Sachs banks, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Finally, it all happened faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current head editor Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey who runs the Berlin editorial board of ZDF was the big favorite.
However, the channel did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, there also appears to have been a willingness not to further harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal is not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14 members of the Commission.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter proposed to the Board of Directors that Nikolaus Brender's contract be extended for five years, but this was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had expressed their support for Brender's reappointment and 7 others had voted against. Brender's removal by vote was a lucid but predictable failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority on the Board of Directors, had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to retake Brender in his post.
Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly regarded editor-in-chief on the grounds that the rate of viewing of the ZDF's news programmes had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, flaunting the increasing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end there were even 35 experts in public law who had interfered in the debate and who felt that Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it won't help.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romanesque (Spanish) languages.
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (radio organ of Rhineland-Palatinate) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily of national scope).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first of all at the news magazine "heute-journal" (journal of today).
Then his career continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was assistant editor-in-chief of the time; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was chief and presenter of the "Morgengazins" (bimonthly news broadcast presented in the morning); until 2001 he was head of the foreign policy department of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial department.
After Brender's disgrace, when he had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialist magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch's opponent on the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF's Intergovernmental Treaty so that the intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a biased political majority.
However, Beck does not plan to request the withdrawal of political figures from the ZDF supervisory commissions.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor had skillfully handled the board of directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without he being expected to place a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetical representations of the parties, Frey is ranked Liberal on the left.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: during a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Conference of Rectors, an agreement was drawn up stipulating that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the weight of the examinations: a single examination should enable the chosen study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload will need to be reworked to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed themselves to organising more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master's courses.
At regional level, there must be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Fewer examinations
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Länder's Education Minister and university rectors have been constantly using the term "studyable" in their mouths.
But for the first time, this expression seems to have a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to considerably reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module should normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", can be read in a document of about 30 pages on the future conditions for admission to university.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board states that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, it should be possible to stop slippages, which significantly harmed the student's ability to study.
In addition, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
Modules as well as the background must be carefully examined to see if one can avoid this feeling of suffocation that one sometimes feels in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the flexibility to allow and encourage personal initiative".
The new regulations will cover access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing ones.
These cycles must be "re-accredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to put pressure on the agencies so that the programmes were not too busy and the examination system not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate has so far been the only Land to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organise tutorial programmes and strengthen educational guidance offices as well as examination offices and the International Relations Department.
The Länder and universities have a budget of EUR 10 million for this purpose.
In early 2010, the government wants to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
As a result, only one examination will be required to complete his studies.
The organisation of studies must be more flexible, it must be possible to guarantee the recognition of the transcripts of other higher education institutions and access to the Master's degree must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "stuability" of all university cycles should have been examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the issue of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated, but criticisms were raised.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students has indicated that he would like the organization of educational policy no longer to take place in the future "behind the closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
No later than after the educational strike, students as concerned individuals should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of the students is very useful to us", she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for each graduate Bachelor to enrol in a Master's degree.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder ensure that today's Bachelor students will have enough places tomorrow for Master's studies and study conditions as good as possible.
The Länder therefore need to hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of reducing access to the Master's degree.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with these words "Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he thématizes in bribs of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who gained freedom but lost at the same time his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a professor of German and English in Bucharest and later a collector in a youth publishing house before moving to Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the artist's house of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and distorting mirror of your Securitate files".
Apparently destabilised and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he recognized before his fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989 in conjunction with some of the participants.
Enrollment trials had started insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner "so someone who has not been sufficiently able to resist the attempts to intimidate Security."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honour of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her exemplary literary intermingles with the mechanisms of dictatorship power, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and lowness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own case Securitate, IM Walter played a role, assured literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and he referred to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
"He had been able to pull it out of all the difficult situations at the time," according to Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before this audience was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is not in fact so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the security spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own dossier.
It can be assumed that the victims will have made speculations and sometimes guessed what real names were last hiding the names of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter borrowings.
Unlike Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
Systematic clarification has been constantly thwarted and slowed down in past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Security (CNSAS) but the return of files has rather dragged on since.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Security in Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very disdainful way towards the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power thought it was possible to express itself here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Of course, many inescapable questions are associated with the Söllner case as happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been dispossessed? The weighted reaction of the listeners, at the admission of Söllner, let hope that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller's work, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
Tumults at the Champions League
It was felt that a representative was coming there, shot at four pins straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross rode at midnight minus a quarter into a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier in hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, let himself be driven into the city which was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our quinquagenarian could have taken the wheel himself – he had not drunk and he was not drunk with happiness either.
He had a nice evening, but tomorrow we had to get back to work.
Because it was now that it was about to start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just engaged three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth in the final", that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall back".
The "big job" is waiting for us on Sunday.
Here, it is a question of repeating to Mainz the results of the league of champions on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that resurfaced after the three quick goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Drawing of lots
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16./17. + 23./24 February/ return match 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn by lot on December 18 in Nyon.
The joy of the fulminent entry into office of Babbel's successor was therefore moderate.
And joy was not moderate only in the lucky one, who had passed on to the destabilised Stuttgart professionals, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and I told them that they had to focus on their assets, I advised them to be braver, explained the "plomber of souls" – Gross – the recipe for success that sounded so well but that no longer had any effect with the healer Babbel.
He triggered a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - a supporter of Babbel -, "in football when there is a new impulse sometimes happens things that would never have been possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of break for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" observed by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the method of work of the new leader: "It is someone who takes action and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the course, warned manager Horst Heldt
For the time being, VfB Stuttgart needs tenacity.
Like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a completely outdated and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with the 0:4 , objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We have not yet gone through the difficult course.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday had no heart to celebrate, even after the first home win in three months, was due to weekend events that a television interview with goaltender Jens Lehmann bounced just before the game began.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, opposed Heldt, in response to Lehmann's acrimonious criticism.
He had accused the leadership of style weakness and said that she had decided to change coaches under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his free day after the matches had been suppressed.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness" pushed Heldt and announced consequences for the goaltender.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends for life with these two quadragenaries.
In any case, they agreed for everything else, that is, without the group's previous work by the coach replaced, strong sports and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "to a large extent in the success" replied Heldt and Lehmann in chorus – and even the man with the plastic bag acquiesced.
World Heavyweight Championship
Warm battle in Bern: Kevin Johnson constantly challenged him verbally and gestually with world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title as World Heavyweight Champion according to the WBC Federation version.
Unanimously he imposed himself on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as world champion for heavy goods vehicles.
WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a single-point win over American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has been defending his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously the Ukrainian had already won twice the WBO and WBC World Championship title.
Unfortunately he didn't pass the KO so much awaited.
Klitschko, out 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, had to confess twice his defeat because of injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Bern Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko mainly wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of his 2.02 meters, by his left-handed side.
Johnson, eleven centimeters smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's blows, thus preventing Klitschko from bringing into play his dangerous right-wing.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his blows only very rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having exceeded with Klitschko the distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko calling him a "bad zombie" who "is not really capable".
During the weighting on Friday, the champion couldn't help but provoke Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered "his" WBC belt which he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year, defending his title as champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the United States.
"I just took a hit in this fight and am in perfect shape," said Klitschko to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to reunite the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having detonated the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko which was due to take place in September.
It would appear that his promotion company is considering having this game played at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Green parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused Defense Minister Guttenberg of lying in the case of Case Kunduz.
The SPD and La Gauche (die Linke) parties ask the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After examining the latest information on the Kunduz air attack, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a counter-truth" on the murderous strike of two tanker trucks last September, said the leader of the Green parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD channel "Tagesschau" (the 8pm newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The killing order was issued in complete disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO, which was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to news reports, the aim of the strike was not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to NATO's investigation report, 142 people had been killed or injured in the US air attack that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Kunduz's military commander.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak as soon as possible before the Federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and her colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan government's policy if the chancery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellery has in no way influenced the army's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were growing to express doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to information from the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had provided to Guttenberg concerning the attack on the tanker trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden some embarrassing details from the Minister.
In the vicinity of the two senior officials, however, it is suggested that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert has meanwhile requested in a letter a clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these charges and referred it to the federal Parliament's commission of inquiry that was to be convened the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The Dream Worlds
Some see, while awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the mentally ill, or under the effect of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality merge.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie down in our darkened rooms, we can unfetteredly indulge in the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, whoever, awake, experiences the state of dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our western world of being mad or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in the mentally ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes incites the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and effect stand out, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitters of the brain - first and foremost dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achetylcholine - breaks and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The Earth's pull force no longer has power over the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of awakened dream; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
We're in the fall of 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic book character.
His body is in two dimensions with garish colors.
Earth's attraction no longer has any power over it, it hovers in the raz of the ceiling.
He's feeling a blow.
Behind him are creatures of winged devil, grimacing, bloody mouth, showing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Thundery, nasty voices scream, coming out of the walls and from the radio.
He can no longer stand those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of its stereo, makes it a loop and attaches it to a hook fixed to the ceiling.
He goes up on a baffle and goes around the neck.
He's jumping.
The loop's coming off.
Let it be a lesson for you, shout in a choir to rip off the eardrum. "Go to a clinic and get treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he experienced six acute psychoses, the last of 2 years, the first of nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is manic-depressive, it takes medication against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their life from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitation, which makes them suffer hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, Head of the Department of Psychiatry of the Heidelberg University Hospital (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is in the middle of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time it finds itself in a passive role, it is like a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
That's why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience a hallucination once in his life.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved".
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the lived takes place in a real setting.
Why does our brain make these kinds of convertibles, is always a riddle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to lose the perception of reality temporarily, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the individuals involved have minimal brain damage.
It is assumed that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what still remains unexplained is the way the abnormality of the neural system occurs and also the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, though there is a predisposition.
Similarly hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain's heating up.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been gathering reports on hallucinations and phenomena of illusory images for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The unreal world in our head".
Hallucinations are well part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also of an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions, are hyperactive or not sufficiently refrened; when our brain heats up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, love sorrows or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants acknowledge having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania and she goes to high school.
A young girl who's doing everything normal to tell you the truth.
If there weren't images and voices.
During recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long brown hair, speaks to him.
When she answers her comrades look at her, amazed – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a whimsical dreamer, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's certain.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this young man friendly.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night apparitions are, in general, frightening.
Often visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to take the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations to the board.
At night apparitions are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for sleep that happens too rarely and far too late, she can often not make the distinction if she is awake or dreaming already, if the images she sees, the faces grimacing or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she screams at these creatures.
She doesn't tell her parents or friends about it, they think she's crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she made internet contact with psychologist Kasten, she knows very well that she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the probability is high that they will have hallucinations after a while.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, makes sure there's animation.
Sarah K., the only girl, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played on her own.
Her hallucinations began when she learned when she was 13, that the man she called dad, since she was old enough to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain zones that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience", according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That's why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dreaming and hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness one unfortunately quickly tends to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and doctor-in-chief of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic of the Florence Nightingale hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but also contains something positive, of creator - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oniroid form of experience, a particular form of modification of consciousness awakened by dream.
The oniroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
The state of oniroid consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies such as for patients with fully conscious polyradiculopathy, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of himself and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that harms his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental limit between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, an organizational capacity which is given to us, men, so as not to sink into the nothingness of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
Zurich's art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as an action to safeguard the soul.
He is 49 years old, at the time his conscious leaves for a trip several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; meanwhile, his body is condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen dives into a world he has created from scratch, visits foreign places, travels in time. He sees himself as an old man bedridden in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lives in the middle ages among nobles who make blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a Greek on a motorcycle who takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the mountain of the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
It absorbs completely into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen, these interior journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes describing what he has experienced.
On the contrary of dreams, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and intensive than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience brings out the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oniroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a state of waking.
Any change in the state of consciousness, says psychologist Kasten "can cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snow can fall
Burda
At 27, the children will take over from the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment as CEO of Burda is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly determined to integrate into society, said Hubert Burda, 69, at the Spiegel.
All details were settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
It will also be necessary to see whether they are capable of doing so.
You can't impose your children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the ability to take care of them.
This would demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was retiring from the post of President-Director-General as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was initially responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently he took care of the Treasury sector, i.e. he was responsible for the company's capital, and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
Thus for the first time it is not a member of the family who is at the head of the Burda editions.
The children of Burda are respectively 19 and 17 years old, her son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's name is also used to link the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda states that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always occurred in the families that have been driven by a bulimia of capital, which have made huge unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That was never my strategy.
I never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I do not see myself in the role of tutor of the country as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken on far too much importance.
Integral beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the objective that seems to have been set for El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, devoted to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious brands such as Hedonai, laser hair removal specialist, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food department, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxing area in order to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax thanks to a session of jacuzzi, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, 250 m2 are divided into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
For example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide customers' steps, offering them an entirely personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos show us how to perform our exercise program correctly.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (heating and stretching included), are enough to work all the muscles of the body.
And if, after having our body worked, we want to go through the hairdressing salon, the Luis & Tachi brand has a room where we offer hair repair rituals, luminosity or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Various strands
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the cleavage, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we need to consider.
Here are some suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated cleavage. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, buy the electric car
The electric company Endesa, in collaboration with the Ayuntamiento in Barcelona, created the "Oficina LIVE".
It is a project to develop and promote electric vehicles in the Catalan capital.
The "Oficina LIVE" (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the installation of the electric car in the city and will put in place mobility agreements, carrying out steps, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
In addition, it will develop the Movevele project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the Movevele Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
The electrical company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative that Endesa is involved in promoting the electric car.
The company participates in European standardisation groups and has a set of complementary projects such as the G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a future of tranquility" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a future of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
During the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without a plan for the competitiveness of the automotive sector, we would now have a landscape of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the brands' decision to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can envisage a peaceful future for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this connection, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integrated Plan for the Automotive Sector (IPA), allocated EUR 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 ancillary companies, which mobilised an investment of more than EUR 3 000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, referring to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the Autonomous Communities and motor companies.
According to the President, this plan resulted in a 6% reduction in the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market and contributed to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased by "40%" in November.
20,000 m2 of vintage cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Exhibition of Collectible Cars, a meeting place for professionals and enthusiasts of the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They are an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only will it be possible to find vintage motorcycles and automobiles, it will also be possible to find in ClassicAuto Madrid items of any kind linked to the world of the engine.
Thus, at the exhibitors of the pavilion, we will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the collector engine that will make collectors and curious people happy.
Among the participating companies we will find, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in automotive sales, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, selling and catering automobiles, or Cochera Clásicos, specialist in Mercedes Benz.
External aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this show will also include parallel activities: rallies, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Fitness tests with vintage automobiles and motorcycles will also be carried out on a circuit outside the exhibition centre.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A Sustainable Sporting Mind
Mazda intends to prove that the sporting spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
For this purpose, it has just integrated into the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for the time being, is only available on the 150 horsepower gasoline 2.0 engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good rating it has achieved as a whole.
Details, vehicle finish, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and attachment.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control panel and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, that of the Honda Civic.
That's why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and especially the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to outperform.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car offers more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this, there is a large chest with regular forms.
The automatic shut-off and starting system of the engine, at least for the time being, is only available on the two-litre and 150 horsepower petrol engine and with manual six-speed change.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its finesse, its low noise, its performances and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the Mazda3 most popular diesel models, those that do not run a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, i.e. the one with the largest number of standard elements.
Among the standard equipment, the Track Change Assistant (WVR), which removes blind spot, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly noteworthy.
In addition, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for another 1,500 euros, includes among other elements adaptable bi-xenon headlights and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
In particular, it is illustrated by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not drive many kilometres per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated solely with the 150 horsepower 2.0 petrol engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the model tested, the Sportive.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will offer us a great deal of satisfaction every day.
"Première" de luxe
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as it was habituated, had opted for a dark "lady".
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows to look at its e-mail, without offering the possibility even to see some type of attachments or to browse the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see him on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, which is less than half of what it costs, for example, the iPhone's data subscription.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is just as limited as his American great brother, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it means to give up data when you cross a border or desperately look for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to view your mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and it has been a long time since it should work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
Repeated reminders from the European Commission to propose affordable roaming tariffs throughout Europe have had a barely noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin, we are reluctant to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it's always curious that it's called Fon when it doesn't have Wifi) offers this type of rates, means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals allowing them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no trouble.
This is a connected device and you pay when you buy it, not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: an option to purchase with lifetime access as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favourite color
Yellow is, without a doubt, the favourite color of the first lady of the United States.
While she went to the office of Barack Obama as President of the United States with a dress and coat of this color, she did indeed choose the same to accompany him in the second, undoubtedly, most important moment of her life: the presentation in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on both occasions: besides their similar color, a yellow pulling towards the green with brilliant reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So, at first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States followed in the wake of the Princess of Asturias and chose to put on the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick lace for taking office, on the other hand, it wore a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with middle heel for the first occasion, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now raised while she was wearing them released the previous time.
75% of working mothers had work problems because of their maternity
Discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study "Fecundity and professional career of women in Spain", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers have had a limited professional career due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of a couple's life and the number of children, whether the woman is working or not, and the type of job she is employed.
Those who do not work outside the home, work part-time or have little stable work, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are pushing back entry into marriage and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after moving into a couple, and this figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector."These data show that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised largely influences maternity, but less the date of the beginning of a common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap in the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference also remains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and tertiary education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years, respectively, on average.
"Another distinction also emerges between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary education marry and have their first child before finding stable employment, those who have completed middle or higher education reverse this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child," Delgado says.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several brand products, singing the universal motto "Because I'm worth it".
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities registered at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if selected were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His greatest representatives, creators and models, both yesterday and today, gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vincent's ace poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de asses (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) some thirty "radiographies" of writers who have passed through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
It does not do so according to predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by seeking something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither fear nor enlightenment.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and reading.
I'll give you a few snapshots here.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the very one I felt without naming it: pleasure against disastrous destiny, guiltless morality and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling, meaningless poetic humor, like the blade of the knife that nearly killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
On James Joyce: "Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand metre peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed through the north face, on which the best mountaineers are still and always caught."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
On his own, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
These two dreams were of greatness."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the craze pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he did so in the flight of himself and invoking post-eriority with a violent speech to the maggots."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed: "God beloved, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser: "Sleep after effort,/ after storm port,/ rest after war,/ after life, tired death delights."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband very normally agreed to tell her that Edward VII was spying on her between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent exceeded madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it was not to try to conceal Joyce at Baroja's house?
What's going on if it's not to get Baroja shot by Faulkner?
What did This do, if not to aspire to the glory of this man so that he might serve as a pedestal for him?"
A cowardly assault
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking around our neighborhood in the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people aged between 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, a mele-blood, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they kicked him twice that left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what is fun to attack free of charge a small helpless animal who, moreover, was on a leash.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energumen who attacks an animal is able to do the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., one Tuesday or another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog has been moaning all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint with the district police station, even though we doubt that it will be of great use and in order not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly assassins were Spanish.
Indignant has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what happens to young people so that they find it fun to mistreat a defenceless animal free of charge that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We don't know where the right education and respect for animals and people went.
Michelin and Fesvial, helmet sets
The Michelin tyre manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as the two structures have indicated today.
The purpose of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of helmet wear, as it is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheel accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which " goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products" and stated that it contributes to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets in two wheels, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure their widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are increasing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the Anfac and Ganvam manufacturers' employers' union, that of the dealers.
However, the good news should be qualified, since the reference for comparison in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound of last month, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, by adding all vehicles that fall into the light commercial vehicle category (passenger car derivatives, pick-up trucks, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95,853 have been sold.
The large clouds that most affect their demand have not dissipated, because, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of cases pay with external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in limiting bank loans, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation must be added.
In the face of this situation and the difference between passenger vehicles, aid for the purchase of 2000E was scarce.
In addition to private individuals, independents and SMEs who wish to purchase a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) was reiterated.
The dealer association is planning a year 2010 similar to the one that is ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of passenger vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As happened with the ABS anti-lock brake system and as will take place with the ESP stability check, emergency braking support systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a waiting period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure, imposed by the European Union, is to strengthen pedestrian protection, although by its mode of action it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The Emergency Braking Assistant acts by increasing the brake pressure in an emergency detected by the system thanks to the driver's kick.
But the latter does not always keep the pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the Bosch car component manufacturer, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had been unable to press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken full advantage of its strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in the vancha, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is calculated that one in four crashes with injured persons would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps him by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum force on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors rejects the plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably on the 8th –, according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that he will need more time to conclude Opel's rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends that each item of the plan has been approved beforehand by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is assured that a decision on Saab's sale should be made in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the American manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with possible new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the application of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, is gaining importance.
In case there would be no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
Driving the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest and precious jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to thin it by less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance at just 1,275 kilos.
This led them to do without, in the first place, the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual sheeted roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, another 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of gain, to mount sports bins, another 12 kilos, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, earning another six kilograms and replacing door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual-clutch PDK box, the test was performed on a six-speed manual transmission model, mainly on roads in California's secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
The decrease in weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with a plumb.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we have tested such a small and lightweight model that, at the same time, guarantees as much safety in bends, including at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low speed for the necessary time, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
This is what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is sudden, whether at standstill or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The road surface we traveled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car handled the potholes well.
The electronic assistants barely showed up all the way, while on some bends we found ice in the early morning and gravel, later in the morning.
In the end, an ultra-light, most entertaining car to drive and which is much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be put up for sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
“Bag Girl”
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house parades, the singer displays her face of bad girl with as much capacity as her Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", it's a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia offers victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant triumph at 91-82 during her visit to the tough ground of the Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by Dusko Ivanovic's team. She is thus at the top of her group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight three-point baskets was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
Vitoria's team was able to fill Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov's important absences with a great deal of commitment and collective work, even though she had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points scored, largely determined the final victory.
The game began quickly for the blue and red, who took the advantage from the start.
The fact that the Vitoria team's first four baskets were marked from the perimeter, suggested that they had jumped on the Israeli field with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 first quarter final.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's indoor game and Eliyahu's work, which was received by cheers and applause back to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to get noticed as the best player on his team, with 13 points scored, although Splitter's "minus six" assessment already hinted that this night was not going to be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria's team that we don't win so easily on their field, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to making the yellows take the advantage over the bright (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from dead, needed to chain up a few skillful actions to take the air, and it was at this point that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun emerged, which, with three baskets at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas put the counter back to a reassuring score (54-67), and which the locals managed to accentuate at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play all for the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) notified that they would not tire anyone of taking what they had deserved from them during the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis came closer in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
The wounds prevent the Unicaja from fighting
The Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to the Olympiacos and gave him the lead of Group B of the Euroligo, in a match marked by the absences of players from the Unicaja, especially in the indoor game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the size of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter, allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with Bourousis's indoor game, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to overturn the score 22-20, in the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fight, between North American leaders Beverley and Williams resulted in the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to function by showing its superiority in both sides, as the injury exit of the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal faults weighed on the Unicaja.
Indoor players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the 44-32 advantage, in the nineteenth minute.
An impossible way back up
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos who, despite the 19 losses, showed themselves superior and even managed to equal the difference of the match held at Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, causing the group's head to stumble.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the encounter.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left some hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos was relentless when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the Olympiacos victory.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine having the largest number of real estate classifieds, jobs and vehicles in Spain.
The tool "How much should you be paid?" calculates the salaries of users from more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you have to register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For the past week the application has been working, the search engine has detected that, as a general rule, the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," explained in a press release Trovit's product manager, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 gross euros a year and a Frenchman receives 31,059, while a Spanishman receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34 247 euros gross annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid work in Spain is that of server, with 11,592 euros net annual, followed by that of seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are driver, half-time and social workers.
Brazil sets date for departure from Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overthrown president will have to abandon the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of his term.
Francisco Catunda, Chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he has to leave the Embassy, where he has been a refugee since 21 September, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, at the end of his mandate, he must look for another destination".
The channel also quoted the former proxy, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the 29 November elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, in the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After pink days since last spring, in which asset inflation has been the dominant market note, uncertainty is emerging again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about an uncertain future by nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to be mobilised.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been practically finalised and, without questioning their non-conformist liquidity policy, are beginning to put some sand in the workings, as the ECB has done, with their one-year auction next week.
As a result, investors question the ability of the world economy to maintain an economic recovery without heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction in risk premiums.
Stock exchange volatility and corporate bond spreads are again increasing, although they remain far removed from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
There is once again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the havens chosen by investors, provoking an increase in differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely touched by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened with a further downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral risk, who were again trying to provoke a case of conscience among those responsible for world economic policy who had curbed the destructive effects of the limitation of credit on the destruction of employment, whereas what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore its place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be completely irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area member country to fail to honour its commitments.
What makes sense, however, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads increase in line with the obligations of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If the European differences were to decrease and ours were to continue to increase, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery models and to revise upward their forecasts for 2011, with in addition the OECD and the European Commission, which are back at the expense of a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not offer much hope for their warning.
Again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for the time being "prudence is the mother of safety".
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán sketched out for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommission, eight-fold.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest €50,000 million until 2020 and an additional €60,000 million between that date and 2030, should nuclear power plants now in operation remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60 000 million but to 95 000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the issue will change, and the power will have to be increased.
Its bet is focused on both gas and coal power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that an additional 18,000 MW are needed, along with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Law that the government has just approved is in line with what his company is demanding, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this direction, despite the "one-off" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any event, Galán believes that investment decisions, although in the long term, should start to be made, as they take some time to reach maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Aer Lingus handling market at ten airports
Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the role of privileged partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, the economic terms of which have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a collaboration protocol to create the Centre for Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation.
The alliance expects an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to conduct energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Acciona plays its first highway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for her first concession highway in Australia, a market she is already working on as an energy company and water manager.
The project at stake is an estimated tunnel of A$1,700 million (approximately €1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and highway dealer.
The town hall wishes to be able to dispose of it by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Ernsts & Young, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their offers next May, the planned investment amounts to AUS$ 1,700 million (approximately €1,047 million) and in the last phase there are three consortia, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in smooth, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest manufacturers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of Europe's leading underground construction specialists.
Against Acciona's team, the Northern Direct consortium was built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction sites and privatizations, but entering them is a major challenge, except through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the already mentioned Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, in addition to their Asian references, which still remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just gained a place in this market by its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona relies on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the sector of desalination.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the grouping of companies responsible for erecting and managing Adelaide's desalinator, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the markets for infrastructure construction and management.
The underground toll road, promoted by the City of Brisbane Infrastructure Office and the so-called Northern Link (northbound link), is intended to connect the western highway of Toowong to the peripheral track at Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the Administration indicates that the auction will take place in the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be opened to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the yard will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will consist of twice two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide A$500 million (€308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work at Hochtief
Australia continues to make much of a success of Hochtief, who yesterday mentioned getting a contract with the estimated government of 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the national fibre optic broadband network infrastructure.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have rapid access to the Internet and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has ceded the 27-story King George Tower construction project in the town of Brisbane. Work has not yet begun and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, is being awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, amounting to EUR 64.5 million.
The company was awarded this contract a few days after it saw itself in charge of the expansion works of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The project is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Sra. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's advertisement
Renfe entrusted the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros a year, said the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was chosen from 16 agencies that presented themselves to the tender organized by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Telecom fine of 63 million to curb competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of €63 million on France Télécom for its anti-competitive conduct in the country's Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony through the signing of exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it places on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore a repeat offender.
An application shop
On the other hand, the French company's mobile telephony subsidiary followed the footsteps of other operators and opened an Internet app shop, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, Orange's app shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has earned 476.4 million in Real Madrid and Barça since its inception.
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs, since its birth in 1992.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, placing them in third and fifth place among the clubs that took the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income of the big clubs.
Indeed, the competition allocated €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) that participated in the event since the tournament's inception, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third on the continent to earn the most money for its participation, and the only one, along with A.C. Milan, won three times the trophy.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are the Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, as far as money reported by the Champions League is concerned, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend $413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification matches (among which the Atlético de Madrid) received $2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to compete received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match contested.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth of the finals receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarterfinals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive $4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça took $2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are the variable payments, to which 337.8 million are spent.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four seats attire.
The champion of the previous year won 40% of the money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid based on the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the offer to purchase shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not require it to issue a public takeover bid (OPA) for all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers €1.5025 per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be remunerated at a rate of 1% per year for this carry-over.
Yesterday, Sos' shares ended at 1.85 euros; Nueva Rumasa's offer therefore evaluates the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects Sos' actual valuation.
The offer is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of the securities.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it took place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos's capital is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos is continuing to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible offers of purchase and judicial go and come from its former directors, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as Internal Audit Director.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a leadership position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the chair of the group.
And it is not free from controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the supposed diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal further embezzlement of funds cannot be ruled out.
Concerning the credit to the Salazar, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Hearing that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing its destination.
CNMV authorizes Paternina exclusion OPA submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorised the exclusionary OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it allowed this transaction because it understood that its terms were appropriate to the standards in force and that it considered the contents of the explanatory sheet submitted to be "sufficient" following the amendments applied on December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95 % of the share capital, composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
He further explained that 5 592 778 million shares were locked in, and that they could not in any way be transferred before the offer was finalized, the price of which he indicated had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the standards in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a crash are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each claim is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labour time can be a long and complex work.
Calculating by hand the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including coins and labor can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Providers of services and solutions for disaster assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the area of assessment tools and industry information development are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very difficult task, because it is necessary to catalogue each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and record its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image is created of each model on which you can click on the different parts of a passenger car.
If it is a massively sold model, the work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-sold car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information about Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in use, the figure exceeds 99 per cent.
To do the documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centres around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas, Madrid.
There, more than 100 technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests $90 million each year to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer various products.
The most common application concerns repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing break parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide that provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose it in our country, but it does so in the United States.
From the products offered by Audatex, it's easy to get an idea of what kind of support it can provide to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or painting schedules.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, not more than ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it has been removed from the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows to bid on vehicles declared wrecks.
Its statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geo-demographic analyses or knowing common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious claims for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer's official parts, prices and times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of accidents, breakdowns or car maintenance.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a historical reference product in the marketplace.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its volume of business has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the last three years, with a turnover of €10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it began its process of internationalization, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3% higher than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on the $1,000 million stock exchange, today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, he has been on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark.
Internet auctions of rugged cars
Last October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of damaged cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be expanded to the remaining 15% next year.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of access to an immense international market.
This valuation and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, breakers and professional sellers who must be registered before they start performing operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650 000 operations across Europe, including 500 000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 vendors and 4000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads a day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer travel, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collectible cars can be re-recorded, although they have been removed, after complex steps.
Garage price in four stages
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audex guarantees that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, looking for the spare part, creating a quote and generating it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified with its chassis number, an actual graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, increases or discounts, and then print out the quote to give it to the customer.
Auda Taller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated labour time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to make these images in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and rotate it to see the inner face.
