Sounds like a typical rugby club to me.
At an English university, maybe...
Nothing to do with the rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But that doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that it's common in rugby is a big deal...
Yes, well, we don't interrupt the Muslims' prayers and we don't break anyone's nose during drinking games (at last, unless it's part of the game), but we actually painted in black for some disguised evenings.
I've never played a drinking game based on the Nazi theme, though.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the prospectus of first-year students seemed to me quite typical.
That said, this new information leaves no doubt to me that they go much further than misogynistic jokes and jokes under the influence of alcohol often associated with university rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows particularly well that they are trying to provoke to the maximum.
You probably don't know anything about rugby clubs.
But come on, why let your prejudices and stereotypes hinder the facts?
I imagine the LSE rugby team is populated by former students from these schools for whom rugby competition is a tradition.
In other words, former boys from the private sector.
From very different backgrounds than those who play rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
So "Misogynist jokes" are acceptable?
It looks like my college's rugby club, I've never seen any racist behavior, but naked races through campus, theft, property damage and misogyny were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't mention that in my last comment.
You can see it differently: tell yourself that your own body itself is partly composed of this ancestral water.
I'm going to gain some serenity.
ancestral so also this interstellar cloud (few, not traditional:)
@lux You didn't read the article well: a small half of the water in your pastis is more than 4.6 billion years old...
Yes, so we can still consider that the fleet of pastis is on average easily more than 2.3 billion years old, which is not so bad as that.
A hell of a nose to the catastrophists and warmers of all kinds who predict us the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water has always existed.
Undoubted proof that the warming stopped 20 years ago (see the remarkable work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
@manon troppo: How is this evidence that the warming has stopped?
I don't see the connection.
I believe that Manon Troppo's commentary is ironic.
Uh, what about the second degree and irony do you have as signage?
So you don't understand much about ecological issues.
It is not a question for "catastrophists" as you say to worry about the disappearance of the oceans but rather about the reduction of water supplies consumed by humans (you know the fresh water that represents less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And more generally, it is not climate warming that is the most threatening for our species but above all the reduction of scarce or not renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our increasingly greedy lifestyles.
As for the study which you cite and whose generous effort you make to quote the source, it is of course doubtful whether the conclusion is true.
Regarding freshwater problems, I reassure you the French are far from being concerned xD Then we must stop considering ecology as a flawless dogma, the hole of the ozone layer is closing quietly (estimated at 100% for 2050 at the current rate).
Yes ecology, religiously dogmatic and irrational ecology, no thanks.
"Then we have to stop looking at ecology as a flawless dogma, the hole in the ozone layer is closing quietly."Yes, it's not as if it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that global warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our land will look like Venus.
A greenhouse which by the action of oxygen will capture the heat without releasing it and which in a vicious circle will accelerate the greenhouse process exponentially.
Has anyone seen any direct actions so far?
Or any sign that 10,000 men would have come to the field to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, whatever it might be?
No, I'm not!
In Abbott's little brains, perhaps sending the RAAF to the Middle East is his version of direct action.
We are moving backwards, for sure.
When are they gonna get rid of that idiot from the village?
The latest revelations that vegetation would consume 16% more CO2 than any allowed climate model gives priority to replanting.
This makes no sense, since CO2 is the most abundant plant food in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flora worldwide.
It looks like this scientific fact has never been flattened.
Did you see the Green Army somewhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument of plant food is only a fallacious distraction.
And before you throw your glass against the Dooms wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulphur.
Perhaps the most abundant of the biologically generated materials is carbon, but that doesn't mean it's the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead's argument is misleading and worthy of ridicule.
Direct Action is a prank, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was most beneficial, it is now being invested where it will receive the most publicity to get the Liberals back to the marginal electorates.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the prize of ignorance, bravo champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants achieve less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
It means that animals and people have to eat them in much larger amounts to enjoy their nutritional benefits.
It is obvious that this Member of Parliament is childish.
So far, he has not presented a certificate of academic rigidity that prevents him from departing from the rules of the seventeenth.
However, punishing him and not Thévenoud is incomprehensible for a lot of people, even if the AN regulation is not a tax treaty.
That lady's making a big deal out of it isn't in her honor, it's mostly hysteria.
If Mitterrand had fined everyone who pronounced Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of names, the "Academy" was offended: "Let's say Mrs.The Guard of Seals" (a position which until then had never been occupied by a woman).
Pure machism!
"The political arena" ....!
The sandbox, the rear courtyard of the Republic replete, the marigot of operetta yelling, the tablée of illusions, etc.
But the arena supposes gladiators, people who take real risks, willingly, unwillingly.
Qd the Phallocrat Umpist sits on the label and parliamentary rules by spraining the + elementary civility under the false umbrella of good manners, the sanction applies to him "s quality" for his partisan stubbornness and his misuse of the political arena.
This Member's behaviour is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's provocative to get people to talk about him.
Until now he was unknown, now he can be proud to be known as any canker of a primary class is known.
The academy has a good back and we can see that the deputies are sensitive to the pocket...
The UMP will have to work to solve its internal problems and stop causing coucs and scandals.
The Academy has a good back, especially when we make her say what she doesn't say.
This deputy behaves like a college student in the middle of a teenage crisis, who makes provocation and whose friends will, in delegation, see the Principal to have the hours of glue cancelled.
and defending it on the basis of a text they have not even read!
Women do not even represent 15% of the signatories to this forum of UMP MPs.
Judge, I'm calling two expert witnesses that a few thousand years apart.
That's why I like to spend time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and attractive.
Dogs, dolphins, sea lions, horses, they all do stupid things for the simple pleasure it gives them.
On the other hand, it seems that we spent most of our 80 years working, moving and shopping.
What a strange phase we have reached - we are able to double our lifespan, but we pass the majority in trouble.
How did we get there?
Thanks to the illusion of anthropomorphism.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
Moreover, "communication" necessarily implies a system of shared symbols.
A difficult concept for you, maybe?
I imagine the concept of inter-species communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is an variance that indicates whether the game will be a race, an object to look for, etc.
It's not difficult and there's no anthropomorphism – although I agree with the idea that we hear a lot of bullshit about animals that are "playing" while they're just communicating.
Maybe the game isn't just "useful" (it can be, or not), it's just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber believes that "there is a principle of play at the basis of any physical reality."
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have raped her."Perhaps yes, hope makes life live...
Thank you for the hope of giving you the opportunity to live, to be healthy and to be able today to answer an article when you had to drink the news without being able to react just 15 years ago.
In general I am not against ideas, and would even tend to be rather enthused by those who seem crazy at first sight.
But when we see what many have learned from their teaching in school, especially among the public most likely to engage in attacks on women, my enthusiasm does not find the slightest beginning of anchoring point.
"the public most likely to engage in assaults on women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's okay, we got it right.
And yes, reality doesn't always smell the rose, even if it doesn't necessarily match your thought patterns.
It is true that the golden youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods do not listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iphone6.
Evry's helpless youth too!
If the reacs no longer reacted, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Le Pen and Sarko as first choices.
I didn't learn anything from all this in school and I never raped anyone (and it's not my intention).
Should I think I'm lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me certain values...
Family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How can we begin to read life when we can't read?
And do young socialists go to suburban schools to teach gender equality?
It would be more effective than making moralizing edits on Twitter, but we would have to get out of the beautiful neighborhoods...
Grotesque this campaign.
They suck everywhere, but to give morale lessons, they're still the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but yet I want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke there about using his bread.
This week's article doesn't go easy.
It's not time to make jokes about bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You made a two-way word game with the word "naan" to refer to a grandmother.
60 pounds for that?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach of a 90-year-old in a nursing home.
How come the more you pay, the less you get on the plate?
Because the quality of the experience is not necessarily measured by the weight or the number of calories, just as the quality of a film or piece is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a sparrow?
It doesn't make any sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to get you to buy more food.
Of course, this must not be the case.
The Sportsman in Seasalter at least is a very good restaurant where portions and prices are both reasonably high.
You pay more because you are still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more expensive you pay, the more likely you are to receive a child portion arranged with art on your plate.
At least they made the effort to put on tablecloths.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can enjoy good dishes?
Is the Manifesto for All only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, it is: a sort of gathering of homophobics.
But it's not just that.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern "child-making" systems.
A child must not be raised in a battery farm or manufactured by technological equipment.
Battery rearing?
Where do you get that from?
And if you contest any technical intervention in "manufacture", you have to demand the prohibition of the PMA for heterosexual couples, it would have the merit of consistency.
I am also surprised that the so-called "for all" event does not yet have this logical claim to its attractive catalogue.
It is true that it is not the only Catholic who manifest: the other religions also, Jewish, Muslim, Protestant.
That being said, it is still useful to remember that these different churches have ALWAYS been opposed to all changes in society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr Dupanloup violently rebelled against the gvt's desire to admit girls to school in the name of "the defence of the family".
We're still in the same pattern.
And, more recently, the same currents screamed at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school became mixed.
That is the credit that can be given to the positions of these people.
You don't have to be catho to be indignant about the commodification of the bellies and the children...
All this is in the right line of the decadence of Western civilization, increasingly contested by others!
For me, freedom is limited to that of others: yes to the recognition of homosexual couples who have the same right to love each other as others.
But there is no question of allowing the child to be a movable object.
And this is also valid for straights looking for GPA.
I just can't like this guy, nor can I recognize his results.
If he had better control of the ball and knew how to avoid moments of stunned stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
Besides, I'm sure any other attacker, apart from Heskey, who plays so many matches for England, will have a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have scored had he been given more than 42 national team selections...
I can't disagree, at least not categorically:) Since this article talks about the goals he scored, I'm not going to talk about the other things he brings, especially to ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa don't bring or don't bring anything), but maybe that would be another reason why he won was much more often selected than, say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12h48 Recommends 119 It's fashionable to criticize Rooney right now so we can forgive you for doing it too.
That said, it is good to take into account that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Agüero has scored 56 goals and made 23 assists in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and made 32 assists in 96 matches.
So a lot of people will have to find another excuse to go after our Wazza because his field stats are excellent.
In fact, "Wazza" is a good reason to ridicule him.
I have to ask myself if you really look at football or think that Peter Crouch A) would deserve as many selections as Rooney and B) would score as many goals if he had had so many selections.
I really don't understand where the criticism comes from about Rooney's abilities as a footballer.
The most difficult thing is to be selected regularly on his country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing Wayne Rooney's (not even attacking) football qualities to those of Peter Crouch?
You're doing this without kidding?
There are really people completely massed.
Please also note for your information that Rooney has not always been England's leading goal machine during his England team career.
Instead, he played the retired front, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You must have written that in a blasphemy.
In a country where the carrying of weapons is tolerated and in a state where 71% of people own a weapon, I find it totally schizophrenic and paradoxical as a way to proceed.
Well, those at this school just don't agree at all with the authorization to carry weapons in the United States!
the use of the pencil is always suicidal.
Stop the bullshit: the girl is 5 years old.
How many kids play with fake guns at this age in our house?
Does that make them potential murderers?
Even though the carrying of weapons is in the American constitution and it necessarily affects the culture of the country, I do not believe that the African kids are significantly different from ours.
A little common sense and reason kept, please.
It's a disarming process!
Rendezvous has surrounded you!
Information on this diverse fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl actually possesses, or does not possess, firstfruits to the taste of the morbid.
Could we start from the assumption that a serial killer can't already behave strangely at the age of five?
If people need a psych follow-up, it's more of a school mess than a student!
Let the parents get their kid out of here: she's in danger!
I totally agree.
Those who run this school are obviously completely ill.
Your reaction is the most relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state in the United States, but it is one of them.
What an incomprehensible damn country!
His relative youth?
These shiny blue suits men wear are nothing like an entrepreneur!
What was Alan Sugar or Richard Branson wearing at the beginning of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar wore a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson wore a rolled collar sweater.
I can't comment too much since I've never looked at this, but it all seems so boring and soulless.
I don't feel like that's what he meant.
Contrarier, maybe?
How depressing!
You beat me.
I would have thought that a meagre knowledge of English would be an asset to business.
I wonder what Mr. Bjayou is doing these days.
Maybe by saying "ostracize," he meant "alienate."
That would make sense.
No, I thought that's what he might have meant, but ostracizing still doesn't make sense.
At worst, if all the candidates dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar wore a grey suit, we could argue that their intention was to ostracize her.
But here, no.
Looks like it's been corrected – weird. Maybe the whole sentence was invented!
It's not weird.
Haha, who knows what he might have said?
Probably nothing, but someone absolutely wanted to quote something...
So yes, the word used in the article was "ostracize," which meant absolutely nothing.
The unemployment rate in the United States fell again in August, about 6%.
It's never been seen since 2001.
Gas prices are falling in all states.
The American economy, with Obama, is continually strengthening.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Their economy becomes "sustainable"?
To live there right now, I would say that the United States is gradually getting closer to the explosion as inequality goes crazy.
The political system is literally rotten by the state of election campaign financing.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration have a magnitude that is unimagined in Europe But Americans still have incredible optimism about the future of their country and theirs!
Until when?
That's the main question.
A few days ago the British financial community said that France was lost.
Now it's America that's at the end of its roll.
Fortunately, there will always be UK to save the world.
Another of these articles that simply forget the essentials.
The US economy's level of consumption is no longer sustainable...
Debts and banknote board could not yet give the change...
Against the backdrop of the depletion of Earth's resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And necessarily the weakest and poor, a very large majority of the citizens, will "trinque" or rather bite.
I can't hurt this Farrage.
Will Labour finally understand that its cynical and deliberate policy of importing compassionate voters from abroad is losing even more support at home?
Probably not, I guess.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any cost.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their Cold War continues with Russia.
Shameful performance of Labour, Ed Milliband is in trouble, it's 617 votes.
As for Clacton 11% for Labour – shocking, truly shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that Blair's government's massive immigration policy was designed "to push the nose of the right into diversity"
Labour wins by-election, Tories lose by-election in safe seat against usip = Labour in crisis Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine that it is the same multiculturalism that leads to this cranky return, the pendulum has started very far since the end of the war, and I imagine that now it will go the other way.
Did you talk about your fight against reality with a therapist?
Lol - Labour's safe seat, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know it, I know it, anyone who's not in denial knows it.
Of course, the Tories have seen much worse, but for Labour it's a Pyrrhus victory.
Look for the word "Victory" in any context, and you will see that when it is used in an argumentative way against the word "Victory", it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a win, but it's skinny.
Labour should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like this in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I am indifferent no matter who wins in 2015 as long as the Lib Dems are not there.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes I know the ice creams of Canada, Greenland and northern Russia fool on hard.
On the other hand, I wonder if the alignment of Venus and March etc. should not be considered too?
In general it is necessary to see the Earth more "pastey" or malleable than one imagines.
Is that how it is?
A few little perplexities.
On the other hand Wylie talks about a "fairly simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the earth's crust, the pressure on the mantle is released, which gives/would give a) a boost to the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface ???
In any case either the "backlash" or the facilitation of access to the surface will be located (more or less).
Hard to distinguish the cause of the effect and vice versa As for global warming, it seems prudent to focus instead on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, patricedusud, does this volcanoism have an effect on our environment?
Does it have an effect on our global warming, future or past?
Isn't it prudent not to warm up again?
When complexity cannot be solved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe.
Yeah, but also, when it's dark, you don't see well.
Good morning, the end of the last glacial period was also accompanied by greater seismic activity especially in the "active" mountain ranges or on the highly iced continental parts of Canada, Scandinavia).
Regards CB
It is all too often unknown that the landcrumb floats on the magma and that the only passage of the moon causes it to rise or descend from some 30 to 60 cm, delayed, following its passage to the zenith, as it does for the waters of the oceans.
This means that the slip of the tectonic plates, like the tides, is more or less facilitated by this moving bump, especially since the polar caps are lightened by the melting of the ice, thus causing a change in the balance of the land at the equator, since the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am enjoying this "human", saying to himself the supreme of Nature and its self-proclaimed commanding sponsor, ridicule himself by his stupid action on the environment that created him and from which he has separated so much that he has become harmful, and to himself and this environment.
And all this to remain the supreme commander of this nature who surpasses him in the organization of his very viscera, by an invention which consists in finding all possible means to dominate one another, one another, mocking collaboration, money.
The earth's crust is not based on magma, but on the earth's mantle, which is made of solid rock.
Personally I find him impossible to look at.
Pretentious and arrogant.
It reminds me of Bronowski's Ascent of Man.
Long live the next game.
Beautiful Wild story1
It rather reminds me of a totally awesome series from about 2002 that was called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely enough, almost no one remembers it now.
Too bad you never overstepped the first impression.
Your loss...
"The geladas, our distant ancestors" You should look at this passage again.
Or read about evolution.
Great program thanks Brian.
I am almost certain that the documentary "History of Humanity" has already been made several times, they still go to Ethiopia (obviously)
Oh there I can't stand this guy, Brian "air miles" Cox, who goes all the way to Ethiopia to pretend to make deer eyes in front of a brain in a jar.
And his narration...
It must be hard for you, forced to watch Coxy.
There may be a support group for you, though.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully well filmed.
Does Marcel Gauchet represent a Marxist compass?
Indeed, it is the individualistic identity that prevails today.
It therefore needs to be self, in-self, so non-conform.
Of course, but Descartes is also at the time of the advent of individualism, and his intellectual question expresses this advent.
But at that time it is just the premises that appear, today individualism structures the whole society, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We are well in the individualism of "mass" !!
Without making it an unstoppable horizon, is there not some connection with the Cartesian approach to examine what one receives to believe, what one believes oneself.
More than rebellion, doubt is fruitful.
Making Foucault a revolutionary is absurd.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatry produced a counter - reform!
By placing the problem at the level of his paranoid navel, he blocked any progress and any reflection on the reality of madness.
And brought the most reductive and reactionary vision that supports: behaviorism.
Gauchet is absolutely right on this point and to be anticonformist is to fight against this award.
Marcel Gauchet is accused of being a defender of order.
That's a great idea.
Be beautiful and rebel, we ask some...
Blacks and rebeux, to the others.
Beaufs and robots, include the most followed by those who see themselves in their mirror.
At any rate, thanks to his controversial debates to bring Marcel Gauchet, this patient and persevering humanist, so educationally enlightening, back to the spotlight.
David Cameron supports the increase in the inheritance tax threshold
How many more budget cuts will be needed to pay for the benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot is going to increase his net worth once he's out of power.
Business advice, speeches, consultation fees, a series of bestsellers written by a nigger on "serious politics" – he will be worth £100 once he passes the gun to the left.
Of course, he doesn't want inheritance taxes.
Wouldn't that be the same lie as at the last election?
And the richest are those who will most certainly pay the least inheritance taxes through super-paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a declining Empire where legacy kills innovation.
He'll be worth £100 once he passes the gun to the left.
Anything.
He'll probably promise to raise the threshold to £1 million, which is way below what you say it's worth.
What was your position when Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Did you also think Brown was only thinking of his own heirs, or are you just a brainless tribalist?
We didn't elect him last time, we had a coalition instead.
You could only afford to accuse him of lying if he was actually elected to power.
Like the rest of us, "Dave" won't die "normally."
Climate change and the imminent collapse will end him and the others of his acabit.
His “richness” will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
Non-taxable income is a social benefit, especially in a country where government debt has exceeded £1,000,000.
We all need to be taxed to pay for essential services and pay off debt.
I agree with you, Exdionys.
I am not saying that discipline teaching is useless, of course, I am just saying that it is insufficient to compensate for certain natural "deficiencies".
Unwise statement for the math teacher she was!
Like what...
Better recruitment and training of teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class has no other approach than quantitative.
There are 2 possible answers, the first would be to select teachers based on their ability to pass on knowledge => reform of recruitment procedures.
By +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Ununderstanding them, she does not know how to act or react to work well => she is reduced to creating a relationship of mistrust that causes everyone to suffer in total loss => she would need 1 training in skills to teach.
A trade that is learning, of course.
But pedagogy is above all an art, a natural disposition and a vocation before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not manufacturing automobile parts.
Pedagogy doesn't get into the equation even when you're a math teacher!
The "sciences of education" cannot compensate for a lack of natural skills.
What is missing right now is a true vocation in bcp of those who embrace the teacher.
If donations exist, pedagogy (I prefer didactic discipline) allows those who are less comfortable not to make mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective issue.
The real unknown today is the students of whom 1/3 tell us: learning is useless I already know what I think.
An article by Slate describes quite well the chaotic situation of this re-entry.
Let's regret the old Teachers' Normal Schools..
It ends at 3 a.m. from this week, but it starts at midnight.
If that happens, it's okay with his schedule anyway.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It doesn't suit mine!
It's been years since his show started at midnight.
We have this thing called iplayer that allows us to listen to shows on demand whenever we want!
The internet is pretty amazing, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at home, I can't really listen to radio shows either.
I have a usb-type adapter on the back of my SKY box that's connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV sounds way too complicated.
Yeah, I think I got the wrong time, I had to hear Richard Lester at about three.
Although they are men in the day on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in her air schedule when one of the men is on vacation or sick, that would at least please people.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Her show is sensational stuff disguised as debate, and she'd be much better off on a channel like LBC.
The lack of daytime DJ women, where none of the regular animators, by Chris Evans in the morning on Simon May's show at night on the return from work, is a woman
That's five shows.
So which one (of these five) is most likely to be modified.
Shennan knows that very well, but don't say anything yet.
Steve Wright is the most semi-detached lately.
Jeremy Vine may be sent back to the offices as a real journalist, but lunch keeps all the chilly air of a Daily Mail radio.
I guess he's quiet, waiting for the current team to get tired of it or get fired.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late??
It's normal for these people to vote FN.
For 40 years we've had the same two parties that alternate in power and make the country's keys to each other worse than they took it.
The countryside is very poor, much poorer than the suburbs with further isolation.
It takes miles to find a cinema, a bar, a gym, a theater.
But since they don't burn a car, they don't assault, they don't deal, they don't interest politicians...
But please don't talk about a department where you haven't lived.
Yes, Doclocal, they're subhumans, sociology is good to look at them.
They have a very high rate of absenteeism and early alcoholism as well...
The FN thrives on human stupidity, inculture and ignorance as well as saying that it still has enormous growth potential, it really needs to be bad for it not to have done better...
Today, the FN thrives above all on poverty, fear of everyday life, fear of the other and feeling that it has no perspective.
Yes, you're right!
What a pathetic humanity.
Fortunately, there are a handful of people like you, intelligent, educated and educated to save honor.
They've been looking for him.
To take voters for c...
That's what's happening.
Who's "they"?
"Forgotten" in fact, there are fewer and fewer resources =>reduce endowments.
This is the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen- you can't just "add and mix", women need to be integrated into the development process.
What I mean by that is that in many developing countries existing standards are being challenged, such as childcare and socio-reproductive roles.
This makes it possible to recognize that women can work in the economic sphere and that's great - it's necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing that women will then have a double scourge, that is, they will be expected to go to work while continuing to fulfil their socio-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced, sister.
The economy and profits do not recognize gender roles.
Money speaks, and if a sex isn't up to it, the next one!
Profits don't care about the life you lead.
What are you doing, what is the advantage and what do you have to offer?
Profits mock heroism and child-rearing.
If it were a crime, companies would listen.
Employers' friends will never employ women between the ages of 20 and 45.
That's what my sister said.
It is very problematic that no one talks about unpaid social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (most of which is performed by women) must be more than 50 per cent of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (not to mention the fact that men do not do enough), but it allows our societies to function and preserve our workforce.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find a true "economic emancipation" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to come back to Mskayadee's point, how can we take into account the disproportionate responsibilities of women when conducting gender mainstreaming projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure he'll help people who need to "check a box."
The tiger is not Russian, it's just Western propaganda.
The Chinese are solely responsible for the current situation and would better sit at the negotiating table.
The tiger with the right to self-determination and the Russian soldiers are simply in exercise near the border, exercises long planned before the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no anti-aircraft missile in its possession.
Free Tigristan!
You made my day!
Oh, yeah, here you go.
It immediately came to me the same kind of idea.
This is a pretext all found to arm a few separatists with a view to annexing China.
If the Siberian tiger is in China, it is that China is in Siberia.
It's only time to fix this anomaly.
Why does an article about a tiger, beautiful felin and in real danger of extinction, eventually turn into an article bently directed against Putin?
What's he doing in there?
This is not a leaflet on the Siberian tiger, but a leaflet on the aftermath of Putin's com' operation.
When you expose yourself so much to the media, you also expose yourself to irony or even criticism.
The ritual of perpetual victimization of Soviet-Putinian sympathizers.
Hollande had also taken the pear with his camel without being shouted at the anti-French plot.
Here our apprentice Alain Bougrain-Dubourg saint protector of Great Russia has personally and physically involved himself in the reintroduction of this tiger.
Anyway, the tiger, he's got it all figured out, he's out of here...
That Holland gets fucked, that's one thing.
At first glance, it seems to be a horribly condescending idea.
But, on the basis of the article, it seems to be both a response to a real problem - emergency dental subsidies - and an effective one.
It is therefore difficult to find something to complain about.
And if only 53% of this sample brushed their teeth before, and 73% later, it's a little meaningless to complain about paternalism.
After all, there's nothing wrong with brushing your teeth!
Indeed - in essence, the complaints seem to be related to the fact that they are targeted at the unemployed and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if that turns out to be true, then it's not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said the department was concerned about the number of emergency dental grants offered by the Department of Labour and Income of the Department of Social Development to unemployed young adults.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I imagine.
But he seems reasonably well thought out.
There's a downside to brushing your teeth.
If you brush them after drinking wine, it can damage the enamel layer.
If your toothbrush is old and rigid, it can sting the gum and cause inflammation.
And I remember a show on the Guiness book of records where someone had tried to brush their teeth the longest and the Guiness judges at the time had strongly discouraged him from doing so because of the adverse effects of frequent and prolonged tooth brushing.
'at first sight' - very funny.
Sounds to me like a rotten experimental design.
The mere fact of volunteering for this study will have changed the habits of participants who knew that tooth brushing would be studied.
That's why most behavioral studies include stuff like double blind, control groups, etc.
There is no way to put these results on the program itself.
Assuming that these text messages are sent to each youth with social benefits, there are two things that differentiate this from the test: 1) They're not volunteers, and 2) They don't give feedback on the times they brush or don't brush their teeth (results easily screwed up by people who give their results based on perceived expectations).
Are there any epigenetic consequences?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) have shown that the maternal environment (including the uterus) can have effects on the genetic heritage, not in the genome, but in gene expression, and that these inherited traits can be passed on to the next generation.
Does the uterine transplant impact this phenomenon?
Nesting itself looks like a kind of transplant.
There are probably consequences, but as long as you don't want to give birth to an impossible perfect clone of yourself, is that a priori a problem?
It seems to me that this is going beyond the limit of reasonableness.
The desire for motherhood and fatherhood must not push the mother and her baby to go ever further, without asking themselves the question of ethics, risk-taking, for the mother and her baby.
No medicine is not all powerful, no it is not limitless and yes it is unfortunate and painful to accept that not all women will have the, or the children they wish to have.
It has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the trance.
But let people, women, others, dispose of their bodies, of their notion of love that can go as far as risk taking and manage your little testicles to yourself, all alone in your little pants to yourself.
of their "confier" this magic bag so that they have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep him sterile in my safe if he can still give love.
The current narrow circumstances make PR FRYDMAN prudent on his communication, but if "we" agreed to reflect, "we" would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material that is involved.
What will you lay down as an anti-argument: cf here these all male reactions curiously....
Marjane, any organ donation is nothing unusual.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not totally trivial.
I had signed up as a spinal cord donor (I have never been selected because the selection is very rigorous and it is understood for both the recipient and the donor), that is a real operation.
Now as a man, I wouldn't allow myself to judge in one way or another or take part in this gift, but I'll listen to the women talk about it.
@Morgane: It's really nothing anodin, and it reinforces the act of love that it implies.
Giving a kidney to a family member who needs it has nothing to do with it, and it is done!
Please, no Messi vs Ronaldo tricks.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need this.
Especially since there's no competition anymore...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
The Deportivo became a yoyo club.
They are too good for the Segunda but do not have the standard of the Liga.
Rivaldo was not part of the winning team of the title.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Deportivo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything possible to break all the goals records of Real Madrid this season so that he can then return to Old Trafford this summer with quiet conscience...
I can't believe it.
I think Ronaldo will end his career at Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you're talking about the stage of the international oil investment company?
I was looking at him on a shit connection so I can't tell you much except that Valencia defended well and without counting possession, they deserved to win.
I was afraid the middle of the field would get out of hand too fast, but they played well.
Parejo's overall game becomes better.
A terrible penalty loosely claimed but rightly saved by Diego.
A mestalla of a chaotic atmosphere and it must not have been funny for the Atletico bus to get bombed.
That's interesting.
A full article, signed by young researcher Amandine Marshall, "On the Origins of Momification", well illustrated, appeared in the magazine Archeologia 524 last September.
It's good to have arguments to confirm and date what you intuitively guess.
No wonder before we got complicated we made it simple.
All science progresses in small steps.
And the "organ" of the woman who was thus preserved was?
Passionate!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me some time ago that a black child's mummy had been discovered in present-day Libya and that this discovery had opened up new horizons, particularly geographical and temporal (I think I remember that the mummy was earlier than the first known African mummies by 1000 years).
Do you have any information about this?
Thank you in advance.
It's a bit of a barrier to reading.
These may not be modern-day contaminations.
Didn't the desert at the time extend less far than it is now?
Why not imagine plants like cannabis growing where there's only sand now?
We know the song.
And it is enough for a European scholar to affirm it, even without any proof, for it to be a scientific truth: the Egyptians and therefore the Africans of yesterday and today have never invented anything even at home.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If not and always "its lesser known" predecessors.
You should read the article.
This is an article written by neo-liberal quacks of the free market that preaches against the mobility of people and for the mobility of goods.
I think there are other people with Ebola who the Spanish Government is lying to us about, so as not to give themselves a bad image and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they may remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same thing about tourism, but right-wing governments in particular (i.e. those in Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than people.
Stop, don't hesitate to call your local MP and complain about the lack of transparency.
Even though I think the government here is just a bunch of cheap, corrupt assholes, like Madrid isn't a very touristic place, I doubt it's their biggest worry.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that allows millions of people in this country to keep their heads out of the water, I would say yes, it's important.
If they were absolutely to repatriate the missionaries, I don't see why they couldn't have sent them to an air force base and treated them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy's mission was to dismantle the Spanish health service, privatising the nationalized hospitals especially in Madrid, which is its base of power, until the courts intervened.
He's just a right-wing beggar in charge of public relations like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's screwed up in the next election.
To be fair to Cameron (I know it's not easy here) socially he is far to his right and would find his place to right-wing religious fools in America.
Now he must sing the praises of the hospitals he had before descended to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I apologize, but you cannot really compare the Tories or any other European party from the right to the Spanish right.
These are separate cases, believe me.
The Spanish Government is lying about almost everything that concerns it.
It's not like someone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting work at the centre of production and economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not be able to do it.
Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions on the forum.
Many TPE - SME bosses seem to read Le Monde to take the time to condemn Prof.
Let us turn to the anti-intellectualism of the surrounding era.
A law professor at the Collège de France seems unable to know the labour market unless he is a Nobel Prize winner in economics and proposes to liberalise it completely
It was so much better before, it's true when Dr. Villermé saw the work of the 8-year-olds 10 hours a day, when the Canuts were being shot on sight because of a signed collective agreement.
Ah, the good old days...
Your reaction is just as fascinating by your ignorance of TPE's business as a boss!
His job is not to know the right in all his ways, but to manage and produce.
Four manuscript amounts written on my salary bulletin for my youth, more than 100 information today!
Here is an example, one could cite much more, which illustrates the continuous flow of constraints, imposed without any measure of consequences, and which stifle small businesses.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a customer of the Sorbon.
In order to twist the neck to the arch-stressed argument of the thickness of the French Labour Code in relation to the Swiss, a serious academic would have plunged himself into the Swiss texts and would have compared the quantity of official texts, then that of the comments (the absence of them may mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
By comments in a Code, whether it is work or not, we aim at jurisprudence in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for enforcing the laws when an employee is dismissed, for example....
In whom is it complicated??
Do you think that the rules of law (laws, case law, agreements, contracts) are unbearable barriers to work and trade?
What's he doing?
How long does it last?
Pullmann "Art has practically been immunized against criticism Ms.
Is this guy still in vogue?
It's probably time for new revolutionary absurdities to capsized critics...
For every article on Ai Weiwei I've read recently, you're one of the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Move on!
Go elsewhere, there's no shortage of choice in the art world.
If China can produce new artists that are not Communist Party spokespersons, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a troll of the Chinese government.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokesmen of the communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokesmen are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think Ai Weiwei's art is a kind of fraud, here's what you're missing.
Thank you for that, you just ruined my breakfast.
I apologize, but you had to expose it at all costs (without making a bad play of the word).
He's the guy who bursts out of irreplaceable old ceramics and calls it art, right?
There is art, and then there is vandalism seeking to attract attention.
Real artists make the difference.
A beautiful artist.
His father is also a pretty good poet.
His father was a well-known poet in China.
Exiled during the Cultural Revolution.
KARSENTY DEMISSION this gentleman is unworthy to occupy an elective mandate extremists on any side (including Zionists) must be sidelined
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous conspiracy theories, which have earned him several judicial convictions, shame both Israel and Neuilly City Hall.
He doesn't represent either.
Philippe Karsenty fights the truth alone, marginally.
ASSEMBLISHING
What does Neuilly Town Hall intend to do against Philipe Karsenty, who is dying of insults to a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls on this urbanist to attack him?
Crime advocacy?
Can't I find Neuilly on my card?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges ???
This type needs care, just like Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the theory of anti-Jewish/anti-Israel conspiracy and whose springs are perfectly identical to those of their most furious critics.
Just as many people believe that in any political decision the hand of the "Zionists" (a term whose meaning tends to disappear, because of its abuse), these two, in the same way as the LDJ or the CRIF, believe that in any criticism, even banal, an abject anti-Semitism "which is not without recalling the darkest hours of our history because it is still fruitful the belly of the beast my good lady would seem to return to Russia of the 19th century!".
Note that Karsenty's incredibly stupid theories about Charles Enderlin's report are even more stupid than those about September 11.
And God knows that the conspiracy theories on September 11 are of a gross nonsense.
And this guy has political responsibilities, which is extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy with the September 11 conspiracy theory, we are talking about cognitive dissonance about how to approach the subject.
Totally blinded by a totally far-fetched truth, having spent too much time, spending too much money to support it, it is unbearable for the adept of this theory to break away from it (as in the case of extreme religious).
As a result of a logic and inescapable flight forward, the end justifies all the means, even the lie, which is an amp, but amp does not seem to disturb the mission of the concerned.
You advise to be careful and not put everyone in the same basket, but that's what you're doing for September 11.
There is still a flurry of unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudi/consorts do not seem to be in a hurry to answer them.
There are indeed very far-fetched theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny anymore...
Health NGOs and public health advocates believe that the results of the study are largely supportive of their advocacy efforts.
And, of course, they will need even more subsidies to follow!!
Just as smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized so that what it really is, alcohol will also know its judgment time where the real harm it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to just say things like "excess alcohol consumption is on the rise," but what requires (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you consider it an attack - go have a drink and relax?
It's better to risk this than to put my mental health at risk by absconding me.
The government puts an end to pleasures when it costs it money.
Here are other alarmist advice based on unreliable statistics.
Two average drinks a day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers but the second implies that it is a more or less safe amount.
Perhaps the Cancer Board and the National Council for Health and Medical Research should come together (around one or two glasses, but above all not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether it is justified or not.
Now we're gonna tax them like smokers!
They're already doing it - soon it'll be grass!
My father didn't drink or smoke, and the cancer took him to 64.
So I'm going to keep drinking my two bottles of red on Fridays and Saturday nights (and the other nights when my wife isn't here).
Why the Cancer Council encourages children to go to places where alcohol is used It's an old news that the Cancer Council deliberately ignored.
What is not related to a cancer risk these days ???
Sharks don't catch cancer - they eat anything but they're not good company.
Sharks can catch cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring subject for many years.
Refuses to run when we can run and vice versa.
I totally agree.
Whiting is Bernie's blessed yes.
They both destroyed the F1 on the pretext of security.
Let's hope he gets better than Schumi or worse Wendlinger after his 1994 accident.
Absolutely agree with you, but pay attention to point 1: it is not the F1, but the instances of the circuit that refused to advance the start so as not to miss the TV broadcast slots.
Quite exact, +1
I would just like to wish Jules Bianchi a speedy and speedy recovery!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, incidents that almost occurred between troubleshooting cranes and f1 were toll-free warnings.
We knew that one day it would happen, and Jacques Laffite, in particular, said it for years.
How the hell could the race organisation and the FIA allow these maneuvers without taking out the safety because?
I can't accept the risk of the job or the fault of luck when we haven't prevented the predictable.
But this accident was.
However, it must also be said that there was a yellow flag, which does not only mean "banning overtaking in the area" but has as its first aim to signal a danger.
It's not shameful, it's fortunate for the family that was supposed to be watching TV.
Even under the yellow flag, the pilots will just stand up.
Under changing conditions, the turn can be much more tricky the next lap and the pilot, believing to arrive with enough margin, can get even at "reduced" speed compared to a normal pace.
But, well, we're talking in the void here, until we see the images, we won't be able to give an opinion.
I don't see how it changes.
Are there any wounded?
According to the CBC, no injuries were reported.
The CBC showed the news this morning before it happened, which makes me wonder what caused the derailment.
It's hard to believe there's still jobs where you have to be on call 24 hours a day.
I don't think there are any people injured because Canada is almost empty.
There may be injured animals like bears, raccoons, etc.
I hope it's irony.
Some parts of Vancouver have the highest population densities in North America and the Greater Toronto Area has a population of at least six million.
In the Saskatchewan countryside, trains do not derail as if by enchantment, and these types of trains often cross populated urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains parade very, very often in a day.
In addition, because waterways often follow rivers in areas where lakes, rivers or oceans exist, they also pass through densely populated places, because people always want to live close to the water.
Also, all rail traffic crosses the center of a city as this was a central element of the original construction of the railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is a huge potential for rail disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge did a report on this last night, really shocking.
You obviously didn't read the article about the derailment and the explosion of a train in a city in Quebec that killed 47 people?
In fact, you're partly right.
The City of Vancouver was a port city long before the railway.
That said, when the railways were built, they passed through the centre of established communities as it was the most direct and central road.
Perhaps employees of the National Railway Company of Canada are expected to attend the next Hazardous Products Conference in Calgary, Canada, on December 2-3, 2014.
CN employees are extensively trained in the transportation of hazardous products.
This article, like many comments, ignores the primordial religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers there can be no other truths.
The whole problem is there and the exegesis of the theologians only reinforces this fact, otherwise what is the point of talking about the sex of angels?
"God said: that's right - that's wrong" > it's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
Word of a leader (Muslim country but not important): "But without religion, how do you want to hold the people?" .
In other words: obey the priest priest priest rabbi imam and do your prayers, it will be better!
Reported below, (Nowak): pb settled in 1905 after 40 years of struggles against parish priests.
May His Noodle Appendix touch you.
Yes, this is what Voltaire and others thought, including Robespierre in a way trying to found a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its cults: that of the Euro fort (rather so far ) or that of the free market (somewhat supported by the state when it is necessary to bail out ) ,etc .
Great ideas arising from religious outbursts.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and secular.
Where rational emerges, the religious is at the tow and expresses himself in the schism.
Religion was born as the ideological support of the state, and the gods put at the service of ambitions even though it also carried forms of protest.
Theology torn between fidelity to the form of revelation and adaptation to the airs of time knows no doubt.
Fanatism is often described as a misinterpretation of "sacred texts".
This does not resist the examination of these texts which are filled with explicit appeals to the hatred of the unbeliever.
Rather, it is the moderate religious (and fortunately they are the most numerous) who "misread" the texts and retain only what belongs to humanism and values common to all humanity, atheists and various believers.
For me, fanaticism is the stupid and nasty application of passages of sacred texts out of context.
Thus, some verses of the Qur'an calling for the killing of "miscreants", "infidels", "hypocrites", "Jews" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if one does not read some verses above or below stating that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in self-defence.
on Yves Petit :" concerning the "foulard", it is indeed a religious prescription that is today almost unanimous among the "savants".
There's idiots everywhere.
The only positive point to draw from this is that it has led to a general condemnation.
Especially in Australia.
Aren't you guilty of the same prejudice as the one shown in the clip?
Band of Neanderthals overpaid and hypersexualized.
They've outraged humanity enough!
What have they done to us, apart from having upset us with Neighbors, For Life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Einstein Junior, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, the Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serious, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the Tasmania Devil and that damn Skippy!
An insult to our intelligence, that's what they gave us!
If you took your eyes off TV for a moment, you would see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with paintings in caves and on stone made by its indigenous peoples and which are still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there's the Sydney Opera and a national opera company that produced wonderful singers such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
Australian cinema has produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
Notable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush, and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is New Zealand, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Let me take another view.
Sox doesn't need any help in this section.
How I managed to guess it would be a "little white"!
Another fan of George Lazenby.
Nice to meet you!!!
But where's Bride Jego?
The largest foreign journalist based in Moscow.
The most amazing one.
His articles are sorely missing.
She understands if Putin and those who support him have made a difference.
Instead, go to Leviathan at the cinema, you will understand a lot!!
Nice effort, Savantcosi!
But you may not yet know that Kastals is just a small Moscow telegraph who has only that to do with his days.
We leave him for a month and when we come back he's cutting the same salads.
Almost all of the 331 killed since the cease-fire are civilians of the Donbass who were the victims of army bombings, due to uncontrolled elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of the hypocritically suggested responsibilities in the article without daring to explicitly designate the separatists is in the NATO line of the World which does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the fable of the pro-European neo-Nazi gentiles courageously facing the Russian villains
@SavantCosinus: Change browser.
I open this page very well on firefox and mac.
If I understand your point, the bad guys are the Ukrainian ss and the good guys the Russian Stalinists you wouldn't be a bit communist by chance
Excerpt from the (very long) document you quote about MH17: "This post has absolutely no purpose to say that pro-Donetsk resistance is innocent".
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation said that Ukraine was responsible.
Propaganda?
To Alexandre Kastals: where do you get these details about the macabre count?
From the Ukrainian army (unfortunately she loses soldiers almost every day, according to her)?
Uncontrolled elements (likely to say anything)?
ALLEEEE THE ROMANIA!
Alleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeez Hungary!
And I say that as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a woman of Hungarian origin, on the other hand.
That said, I can't stand Piturca's team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the existing powers who has not stopped denigrating Romanian football to the pathetic level it has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Coperativa", which decided before the start of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would go to Europe, which would be relegated, and which would launder the money at its option, mainly by selling players that were well underestimated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, was doing business with the aforementioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about one million euros), then paid them, but, apparently he was misadvised by his lawyers, refused to admit his errors to the court (which would have earned him a sentence without serving a sentence), and therefore took 3 and a half years in prison.
The trial also resulted in prison for the Becali brothers, four club owners, steaua manager Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for football-related offences.
George Becali is also serving a sentence for trying to bribe (and later conceal the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the final game of the championship, to be able to win the title and win the Champions League jackpot.
The team he tried to bribe were our neighbors in Cluj, Universitatea.
We won 1-0 in their stadium, a result that allowed us to be the first Cluj champions, while they were relegated.
I always enjoy this moment so much.
In the concealment of this attempted corruption was involved, among other things, Piturca, who signed as a witness a false document that insinuated that the money that the police had confiscated from Cluj was in connection with a sale of land.
So this poor, uneducated, stupid, cheating and lying guy doesn't represent me, and never will.
Hungarians are just a bunch of nationalist idiots these days.
You might think that after the last time they broke stadium chairs and shop windows, and where they brandished racist banners on the streets they, couldn't have got tickets this time, but no.
I thought Neil Lennon was about to take over from Al-Ittihad.
Wherever he ends up, it'll be a disappointment, after Stockport County turned him down.
Great article.
If Sarkozy had done this, we would have heard the left screaming like a big sick woman.
But since it's the nice Hollande, friend of the unions and small people, we hear a little protest, but low
This is why economic circles sometimes prefer that a left-wing party settles in power.
It was the bankers who financed Obama's victory, and they didn't get any of their investment!
"the absurd idea that the majority of job seekers are not looking for work" LOL (no comment)
Should employment centre generalise the control of the unemployed at the beginning of 2015?
I hope that in the wake, the tax pole, will also generalize the absolute control of the gougnafiers called commonly ploutocrats, banksters, kleptocrats, tax escapees, thief bosses, and other malandrins.
Do you know how to make a sentence without the words banksters or ploutocrates?
You look very proud of your jargon every time.
That's right when you're classy: you treat the population like letterheads and teethless.
At each new period of unemployment it is dozens and dozens of applications that I send to employers who most often do not even boast of an acknowledgement of receipt, it was automated.
It is also the total absence of follow-up or support from the Employment Pole.
To conclude, I would add that the "socialist" patronymic of this government appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaurès or Mendès France.
Have we read here an article from the duck chained?
One learns that an unemployed person can stay for several months without news of his agency, but that he must continue to look for jobs by his own means.
It is reported that the controls have resulted in the write-off of people who for more than half were no longer receiving unemployment benefits.
So we're wondering how we can control people we never see.
One wonders what punishment represents a write-off for someone who does not have access to employment services or unemployment benefits.
And if we can admit that this reform will make it possible to write off more, we wonder how it will help recruits.
"We learn that an unemployed person can stay for several months without news of his agency, but that he must continue to look for jobs by his own means" Indeed, it is shameful.
The question must be asked, why are these countries in the EU when the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's egalitarian ideals?
It is not as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done much about racism in football either?
Should we drive them out of the EU?
The EU was originally only economic and should remain so.
The purpose is not to be a "police of thoughts".
The EU is a pacifist project.
It makes no economic sense.
This is probably the reason why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is the most unequal society in Europe.
What equality???
Eastern European teams are constantly being held by the corrupt Mafia referees, UEFA.
The best solution would be for the whole East to leave this lucrative rotten organization and create its own.
At least we'll finally watch football.
This anti-racism crusade is just a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Currency and trade, rather.
The European ideals of equality?
So what is Europe doing to let the United Kingdom in?
The Uefa should applaud them for foiling Blatter's comedy and his men.
It's been happening everywhere for a few years, and I'm not exaggerating.
From the Guardian two or three days ago:
Would he expect to be retaliated with small, symmetrical sentences, just to keep up the controversy?
In any case, it is a fact that at every small event towards peace, there has been, there will be, and there will be people working to throw oil on the fire.
The decoding would be to say that the Western states are against a "Palestinian state", that they are pro-Israeli and that this alone explains that these states have never done anything against the Israeli state.
The decoding would be to say that in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian question, action would have to be taken against the Israeli overarmed occupying state of identity besieging destructive oppressor colonizer
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine to the detriment of an Arab population who had nothing to do with the Shoah, it would have been more reasonable to empty Bavaria of its Germanic inhabitants (who were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them with the surviving Jews.
It would have been justice, the Germans had nothing to claim and Europe would have kept millions of people educated, entrepreneurial and dynamic.
Mr, let's take the example of the colonization of Western Sahara...
Let Morocco be the colonialist, that's obvious!
But, as with Israel, we must also question history, its allies and its supporters in order to see truths.
Colonialism, whatever it is, has never been altruistic, we agree.
Then stop your pirouettes to support Israel as a colonizer.
Gaul has been colonized by the Romans but at present there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gauls or others.
In Palestine, there is discrimination on the basis of origin.
Moreover, the Israeli state is defined as a "Jewish people" of which no non-Jewish can be part.
The Israeli state discriminates against non-Jews, hence litigation.
Conclusion: In order to resolve the conflict, we must break with Zionism between Jews and non-Jews.
In the Maghreb, some peoples have even been baptized by this saving civilization by the name of their first status!
Two realities that need to be stopped ignoring.
First, the Zionist European project (colonizing-appropriating Palestine) involved dispossessing the Palestinians, so it was an intrinsically anti-Palestinian project, so the solution requires breaking with Zionism.
Secondly, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay has failed to bite from the start.
Their dull result will give them enough to bite their fingers.
He should start his rehabilitation with small bites.
I hope he hasn't lost the appetite for the game.
We tolerate so many foolishnesses, including racial insults and physically harsh tacles in football, but Suarez has been punished too hard.
I'd like to see him come back to England, no matter what purists say.
Yeah, I hate all those molarizers.
Football is a contact sport where the tacles exist and yes, therefore, the players will hurt themselves.
The fact of getting his teeth into an opponent's flesh to have the advantage certainly has no place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches for committing a similar move.
It's now the third time Suarez's done this.
If you'd bite someone at work.
What do you think would be the consequences?
I knew someone was gonna bite.
If you're dyslexic, I forgive you.
I'm actually slightly dyslexic.
I forgive that two-ball sarcasm.
I bet he was looking forward to coming back and playing with his teeth.
All these puns about Suarez are losing their bite.
I almost bit the hook.
A prerequisite for a good school path is the respect of the students for their teachers and the school.
It works if parents instill this respect in their children.
Parents transmit this respect more easily if they also feel respected by their children's teachers and schools.
In good schools, those who advance their students, parents are regarded as partners, not as women.
Who can believe that it is the teacher who should do all the work (teach, educate, learn respect, limits, live together short) It is up to parents to do at least 50% of the task.
But it's probably easier to go after school.
Playing on parents is not operational.
No one really took on them.
Action will therefore remain limited.
On the other hand, the school could do a lot.
The operational solutions reside there.
Should the actors (professors, hierarchies and ministries) play their part in this and should not be permanently affected?
We can disband a band that's unwinding to revive it, not the families.
How not to talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses allow us to give the change.
We pretend to train teachers, but we forget the school's leading role.
Communicate knowledge.
And if parents require it, it is that the school provides the education of their children.
What is the minister who dares to put back in place what was called the Public Instruction?
Disappointing article: little information, partial and destructed reflections.
Were you really waiting for an intelligent comment from this beauf of the suburbs of the East?
It's a beauty, it's clear, but I think he's from Willoughby, and so from the North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
No wonder we're having a budget emergency.
Let him down and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
Totally true
That's right.
A little Aloysius.
His electorate is the seat of North Sydney.
Indeed a beauf of the North Coast!!!
Well, if British BBC viewers want to compare the neo-conservative governments of our two countries, they would obviously come to the conclusion that both are led by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers party.
He looks like a grumpy guy these days. :(
Yeah, but well, his leader leaves him on a regular basis on his hunger.
You would be rather grumpy too if you woke up one morning and realized that you would never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these licit and illicit benefits for life will forever stay out of your reach.
Poor Joe.
Really pathetic.
He half tried to present a budget and then he gave up.
At least he's not threatening to hit anyone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
She will be able to order it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and demand aid from the state.
And since she knows how to lobby, no worries about the outcome.
And so much worse for the employment in France which it has nothing to do, it that comes from vegetable growers always ready to break when their corporation has losses on the markets, especially outside...
It was precisely because their lobbying did not work that the order was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the deadline or a marpol fit-up, there is no doubt that the project would have been successful.
After that, to find out if it's good or not and how BF will comply with the law despite everything, it would be nice if "the world" leans over!
Brittany Ferries is owned by Breton vegetables.
Those who burn tax and security centres.
They want state aid.
That they don't have one seems to me to be normal at least.
Well to the extent that armed a French metropolitan flag ship is 30% more expensive than any other civilised flag, yes it's normal to expect a boost from the state.
Or else we can tolerate the British monopolizing the market.
It's your choice.
Eternal French problem which considers its maritime facades as tourist destinations, and not as areas of activity, where sometimes people different from the middle Parisian live.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, short envy.
One of the reasons why Britain must regain its sovereignty.
That's it and then they'll create the Breton pavilion with crews exclusively composed of pure strain Bretons.
With this it's sure they're going to cut costs significantly...
Of course.
Unfortunately, this is what we expect from the BBC now.
They have always hated everything that related to the prog, so it's not surprising that they chose to bypass Hackett's solo career, which has always been closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s than those of the other members of the band.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was to sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel's solo work either.
I don't think the BBC can be accused of " hating everything that relates to prog," as they just aired a one-and-a-half-hour documentary about one of the biggest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about the Genesis band, not about the solo projects of its members.
As for Hackett's solo career which would be "closer to the Genesis spirit of the 70s", I disagree.
Hackett no longer has the right to take the road, play a bunch of Genesis songs on which he had varying degrees of participation and pretend to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour has the right to gather a bunch of half-finished demos and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett's asking for nothing more than a fair performance, but he didn't get it.
A curious feeling, Bank's first solo album, is absolutely awesome, and quite in the Genesis spirit of the 1970s.
They overstepped Hackett's solo career because, let's be honest, she sucks.
Yes, it's one of the best prog bands but would the documentary have been made if they hadn't had their commercial pop success in the 1980s?
I still haven't seen the BBC air a long documentary about bands like King Crimson and Gentle Giant that have an equally interesting story but misses the popular appeal Genesis has.
Good remarks.
I would still say that the BBC has "always" hated the fact that it ADORATES progressive music over time.
A person with a personal interest shouts "prejudice": of course.
A little more of the interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
Absolutely beautiful song.
If the death penalty is an attempt to repeat one horrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes against innocent people), then it is a resounding success.
There will always be a big difference between a criminal sentenced to death and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his false understanding of society and its rules.
Those who kill do so from the most just and wise vision and reflection of a society.
That is, they have no excuse.
They're indefensible.
Yes, we understood your point of view, the first time already.
That is precisely where the difference lies, Mr LeClos.
We must have the common spirit of conflict in order to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal's been doing since he heard things wrong.
But this is also the result of pain, hatred, vindictiveness among the relatives of the innocent victim: a distorted understanding that can never be used by those who wisely decide on the death of others since the sound and just reasoning of their pedestal.
But, in an attempt to balance the analysis, it could still be argued that the condemned person, often, exercised savage violence, which he was able to enjoy, against people who were fundamentally friendly, who made the cost of it free of charge.
The relatives of these unfortunate victims will eventually see their pain alleviated with the disappearance of the one who was the executioner, sometimes the torturer, of the loved one and who haunts their nights.
Let us not despise their relief.
Thank you Émilio for this thought that I find very right.
Strong and moving article.
As for Marc Asnin, he shows great intelligence.
The heart one.
That's probably what I've been reading for a long time.
One would however like to read stories from another era, ancient things, that the barbarity of the past would excuse, and then these are the dates that slam, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is that great.
Same for the other two "Excellent American Writers" cited here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all overrated.
I thought you stopped the white one, man.
What's that supposed to mean?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is immeasurably better than that painful Bellow, who received the award.
Perhaps this year's Nobel judges have decided that if we have to have an American winner, we could just as well have a racist [light].
Munro's very good, too.
They all produce "genius novels" as if it were a literary genre.
His homonym Joseph, on the other hand...
Which ones did you read?
How many books from DeLillo did the anti-DeLillos read?
I never finished Underworld but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
News like "Human Moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first lighter, wilder, smaller novels, and their dialogues, are also great.
I don't know if I'll ever finish Underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who pretends to live in the same world as me and have read enough DeLillo's books to reject his talent as a writer, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict...???
It's just an interest.
It was a trait of humor, "the law," not a request for a definition.
Between the text and the spirit, it seems here so EVIDENT that the lady acted in HER sole interest, and absolutely not in that of the institution she represented, that one wonders what the term "conflict" comes to do there.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll take very dearly!
Yes, state services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they have not warned him of the danger.
After that we will hear that French employees are not dynamic and only seek tranquility.
Flooding areas that become buildable overnight when a big construction program is going to start, it's classic, and not just on a low coast.
Look at the alluvial plains near the rivers.
We were told that "Today, there are no more floods due to regulatory dams."
Now we need to expand the retention lakes upstream and cross our fingers.
But it will be because of the state services, of course...
Profit on the ground, on the whole promotion?
On the ground.
So 6 million euros.
Is there any clearer interest here?
Get the calculator out and you will dream of the life you could have had by being in the place of Mrs Babin, the 1st Deputy UMP of La Fault sur Mer and former president of the Town Planning Commission, the one who grants the building permits!
The two nipples of the triumphant Sarkozysme are the old and the real estate.
I'm on the left and not at all sympathetic to Sarko, but please, no political bass or all azimuth low kicks, we're not in there in a stinking ball battle.
I wonder if the cops involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
U.S. cops are hardened criminals.
The U.S. is a shithole.
So what shithole do you live in?
The U.S. is not a shithole.
Yeah, the U.S. cops are hardened because of the shit they deal with on a daily basis.
Of course none of them ever does anything but the cops "come and piss them off because they're racist."
That's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic in the US, it is unfortunate that an incident like this is needed to force people to see the problem more closely.
Your generalization reveals a deep ignorance of the US...
It's you who don't know about it here.
Good cops have to report corrupt racist cops.
SELL 'EM!
Do the math.
This kind of open racism does not exist here.
Is this the first time you've been involved in a conversation?
It's not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant while in fact it's clearly you who don't get anything - many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetual problem of racism in the United States (it's not idle speculation).
It is highly likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate how much tension is rising about it right now.
And therefore, the boundary between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances NYPD in different ways, hence Occupy's treatment there.
What amazes me is the naivety of some and shocking the false naivety of VA and others.
And where do you think journalists di'nvestigation find their information?
On the Internet?
They're going to interview those responsible, make them talk, cause them to have confidence.
That man going to the Elysée is really not surprising.
Second, what matters is overlap, verification, analysis.
And now we understand that the sarkolâtres have something to worry about.
@Munstead, our current president was elected on a wave of antisarkozysm based on cases mounted from all rooms (one no-place and no convictions) that seem to have been concocted by magistrates (2 referrals to corrections), two journalists friends of Holland.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, politics, executive and the press that is not supposed to be an organ of power does not shock you, it is that your partisan spirit blinds you!
RV with Holland ...
And of course all this is only coincidence and not remote-guided!!! ...
If you think that only Sarkozy's supporters are outraged!
From the excerpt I read, the VA article just waters the sprinkler.
I even laughed so much it was rude.
For the rest, the World's complaint is unlikely to succeed because journalists are not "strung" to the secret of sources, are they?
The difference is that there does not seem to be any connivance between VA and power, while there seems to be a connivance between power and the journalists of the World for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one waiting for an explanation from the World on the substance and on its dangerous relations.
We are facing a state scandal that in any other democracy would cause the government involved to fall.
Hence this editorial in the woods, which speaks volumes about complicity with the current government.
It's not a question of the left or the right, it's more serious.
I'd have thought the bilge would be fine with the smoked herring!
It's just for the numbers and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I'm sure if I were a second generation immigrant whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here I would have my doubts about immigration but that's not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensible people on a BBC immigration show was a second-generation Sikh who said she was comfortable with the number of people entering and the changes they were making with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not at all cooperating, refusing even to give soup lads simply because of the lady's religion, he also refused to enter her place of worship although she told him that he was not obliged to pray.
** "who said she was NOT comfortable"
As we all know, if we let it happen, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - anyone who imposes limits and disputes it must be admired even if he is an ad director :) Good for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were more left, it would be communist.
What do you think the New Labour did, especially on the left?
The liberalization of a country, the NHS this NHS that repeatedly, the massive immigration of immigrati (in their own terms to properly stuff the nose of the right in it), the culture of social benefits, the age of the all-is-permitted, the politically correct that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that Labour is center-left and not communist, I said that to joke, what I mean is that they socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the state.
It's typical of the left, if you ask me.
Drop your prepared arguments as much as you want, but what I asked you to do is make specific examples of leftist politics, or a left-wing program defended by the New Labour government.
Can you do that?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what he said the New Labour had done, which is especially right-wing.
He gave you his opinion, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you were asking.
Yeah - it's not Tim Bell's territory anymore.
So Martin Sorrell, the UK's most powerful advertising director, associates the situation of his parents with that of the economic migrants who are coming to Britain now?
What an insult to their memory!
He was totally right to do it.
France to the French!
We fought in 40 45 to fall into another disctature, that of money.
We'll make pretty savings by firing these technocrats...
I will be told to renegotiate the treaties.
So, let's renegotiate and if the word "democracy" still has a meaning in Europe, shouldn't it?
Curiously, the committee does not look at unfair tax competition between countries vis-à-vis companies.
This must be a negligible amount.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to make the rail transport sector fully marketable.
At term, this means that whole sections of French territory will no longer be served by rail.
The abandonment of many territories will only strengthen.
To sacrifice everything, including the advance of a country, in the name of liberal doxa does not seem to me a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will have to be dealt with one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to clarify the accounts of the SNCF.
The French state has long resigned.
The regions have the impression of paying for nothing, but not the means of forcing the sncf to respect its commitments.
However, using public money without wasting money is essential today, when public resources are constrained.
And the huge needs.
I don't see very well what the competition of the TERs could consist of!
Does he still have a problem with alcohol?
If that's the case, shouldn't he be head cubs?
It seems to me that you have not really been able to distinguish the problems that existed during the marriage and that you are, of course, still overcoming the pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Of course, having an alcoholic ex living so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is annoying and very difficult.
Having said that, it would make sense for me to start the process of separating your life from the complications you inherited.
It looks like they're doing it, but it sounds hostile to me.
Since you all live so close to each other and the complications seem likely to persist as new ones surface, have you considered a "plan" of "leasing" so that you can cut your life off from your future?
Financial problems have a negative effect, but with a compassionate real estate credit company, a good lawyer and some pressure from the court, they can be solved.
It looks vindictive and persists.
Why not go to a Family Advisory Group to say things openly and provide support to help them get back to work and pay support.
I think that's the key.
Your life is made of much more than the time you spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it involves meeting the new woman.
Tell them you will support their choice whatever it is.
Notify them that he will not necessarily keep his promises about contact and ask them to think about how it would make them feel and how they will manage disappointment if he does not keep his appointments.
Try for them to keep in touch with their father.
If they see you doing this for their own good, despite your own resentment because of the way he treated you, they'll respect you.
They will never stop loving you and if you do everything you can to facilitate a continuing father/child relationship, they will know who to thank when they are older.
I'm of the opinion that children end up understanding who's at fault, if we let them see things for themselves.
Go another little effort you are close to point Godwin.
It is folded, in 30 to 40 years civilization will have disappeared, short-term economic interests are too powerful, it is the pot of land against the pot of iron.
Moreover with globalization the country that does in the least so social, fiscal but also environmental has immediately a competitive advantage, and the others are obliged to follow.
All the policies are looking for is growth, Growth.
There should be international coordination, but by then...
It is not the climatosceptics that produce C02.
It is everyone who is heating up, those who use air conditioning, those who take the plane or the car, those who live in dwellings that have had to be built, those who buy industrial products that had to be produced and transported.
It was not the climatosceptics that protested against the ecotax, but the truckers.
No policy is climatosceptical and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that climates emit more CO2 than others.
Environmental advocates also travel for conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they matter, will not suffice.
There is also a need for political action (other sources of energy, reducing dependence on the automobile, etc.).
And politicians act in part according to the sensitivities of their electorate.
"I'll be back" is actually a famous promise from McArtur made on March 11, 1942 when he left the Philippines.
Terminator just took over the expression.
But maybe it's humor to say that the expression is from Terminator.
"greenhouse gases are a pollutant" There are 30 different definitions of the greenhouse effect.
So we don't know what it is, but any good apostle of the dogma of the CAR seems to know what it is.
Nobody knows what the greenhouse effect is?
Guardian Bingo: How long before someone blames immigration?
I'm putting the blame on the scoundrel who took all the money.
Do we count the Liberian in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I'm asking for my $5.
I blame the democrats' liars.
Or the democrat crooks.
Or the liars of Labour.
We don't care, they're the ones responsible.
The displacement of populations could be a very real aspect of this epidemic.
Asymptomatic or sub-clinical cases that jump into a car or plane to escape the epidemic simply move the infection faster than they can imagine.
Is sex with monkeys better?
You think it's a virus?
I don't advise you to ask for a prescription for antibiotics.
He contracted Ebola in Liberia.
This nurse contracted Ebola in Spain.
Damn it, indeed!
Don't use the word immigration, you'll scare the horses!
The UK depends on immigration to pay for all our pensions, to take care of our old people, to empty their hygienic ponds, to bury the 30,000 people who die each year of hypothermia or hunger, (don't forget your wool and hat, which allow you to warm up, turn off the heat AND eat this cheese sandwich).
Don't be so stupid.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will bring Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is this a (bad) joke or isn't it made on purpose?
It's more comfortable...
That's how public money is wasted to allow a tiny minority of people to spend good time in space making gallipetes and gnawing while playing clowns in front of television cameras.
So reality TV didn't invent anything, and the authorities are probably waiting for a baby to be designed up there to ignite the world and delight the media coverage to western royalty accustomed to tabloid maternity.
Maybe they should go down to earth and find out we're working here!
Contrary to what you seem to believe, we don't send men or women into space to make gallipettes or clowns, but to work.
And this work is very useful to humanity in general.
And this, in all areas.
Many things that improve our daily lives, come from space research.
So yes, it's money spent usefully.
Can you quote just one thing that improves our daily lives and results from space research.
It's just a cash abyss.
the ballpoint pen that works the tip in the air (for writing to the ceiling for example)
To pay his bills?
To participate in the manufacture of an umpteenth useless product?
Or propose how to make more money for investors?
In short, working to work means nothing and represents emptiness itself.
Ah if the last high tech play.
Behind the tiny minority of individuals who go into space, there are several tens of thousands more who are working to make it possible.
You know, people who work what, including more and more private companies, especially to get the cargo to the station.
If you're thinking of buying a plastic gun...
But, what about those who don't think they're buying a plastic gun now but have the potential to buy one in the future?
They may be the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to misunderstand people to make them believe it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article, would it have hurt the author/editor to put a photo of the "sword" in question instead of generic photos of "plastic swords"?
Or even to be curious enough to wonder what the inscription (if any) on it meant?
Bad typical reporting, one dwells on the fact that "it's just a plastic sword" and not on the inspiring jihadi text that is written on it.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Shiite Islam.
Dirani's family, on the other hand, is a Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups that seek to bring down governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people would stop laughing at the fact that plastic knives are harmless.
In skillful hands, they can be deadly.
Even the small cutlery we give in fast restaurants can pierce the flesh.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it's a common decorative object, it justifies the ridiculousness that the author gives it.
There is no need to try to make it a "ha, ha, a plastic sword", the facts as you have stated support in fact its argument.
I occasionally saw these decorative objects in Muslim houses, or painted on walls, they never looked threatening, just another version of a "cross".
Jesus, you're right.
And it makes sense now...
I saw this guy who looked like he was from the Middle East at Kebab Stop and was distributing plastic knives to anyone all night!
I like the conclusion very much.
All the wonderful novelties, often technological, suggest to many people that it is a right and a need to benefit from it, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a spread cost (subscription, electricity consumption) that weighs on budgets.
And the inability to take advantage of new technologies creates frustration.
For example, use the Energy Solidarity Pact, which makes it possible to isolate the attic of a house for 1 € symbolic when it is inhabited by a modest household (the costs of the work are actually borne by the energy suppliers!).
Simple efficient but unknown even if more than 3000 houses have been isolated this year!
Interesting PES.
But never heard of it.
Who can use it and how does it work?
For information 60 million consumers, test water-saving showers and recommend the installation of water-saving equipment on taps and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 can reduce its water bill by 30% (from 150 m3/year to 100 m3) or 50 m3 of water saving per year, while keeping the same comfort.
It's not a demand crisis, it's a system crisis that can no longer produce enough surplus (which it would then have redistributed in the form of revenue increases in real terms) so that these surpluses pay for the increase in expenses you classify as "constraints".
In other words, energy insecurity is "just" the reverse of the medal that the economy can no longer grow as fast as it wants.
Note that the (neo-)classical theory of the economy is totally unable to answer such a question, because for it, there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no element likely to force, increasingly decade after decade, the pace of economic growth.
By its very definition (in physics), energy is what makes it possible to achieve any physical transformation.
Since producing, basically, is transforming, energy is the means of achieving the least economic production (good or service).
And the more you want to produce, the more energy you need.
This means that any upward pressure on energy (improperly called "production" of energy), even in the form of an increase in its price, in turn forces production to increase (except to improve energy efficiency, but improving energy efficiency still requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive enough).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy insecurity and whether or not we can grow the "production" of cheap energy.
And the data published very officially, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation can only get worse in the years and decades to come (the IEA, in these latest reports, clearly indicates that in 2008 we reached the peak of conventional oil production, understand, cheap oil.
However, oil is the most universal form of energy, because of its very high energy density, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good work whatever the performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and we didn't bring anything back, so it makes things even.
Take this France!
Vote No on 18.
You're a webmaster of the Guardian?
As it has been noted before: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
That's right, nice work, guys.
Although many English people like to make fun of Scots when they just lose, there's nothing to say, they bring a little color to the tournaments when they manage to qualify, at least until they get eliminated in the first round.
It's even more fun if you play against them ;)
England is starting to worry me.
Because, now that the "golden shige generation" is retiring, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the starting XI, why change a winning team?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, was really "international-class", is David Beckham, a little effeminate, perhaps, but I think if he were to tack a overweight potato like me, he would crush me completely.
People forget his athletic constitution, by the way, talking about athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I never make fun of Scotsmen.
I tend to surprise myself watching their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, really was "international-class", is David Beckham
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best hours, a very good player.
It's sure that Juppe would find it hard to ask for 100,000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
And not sure he'd get them if he asked for them...
You mean people come to laugh at each other?
For the rest, I'd be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, lives only on his deputies' allowances...
I wonder, above all, what he can tell in his lectures.
How to reduce its deficit?
How can we return to full employment?
I would say that no serious lecturer in a scientific discipline, whatever his scientific level even if he holds a Nobel Prize, will think of asking for the slightest amount.
Conferences with content are mostly free or almost free of charge.
And I can assure you that these young people are really working and that the results presented in their free conferences are real.
At the time of the restrictions on the research budget, the ratio of these two figures is edifying.
Researchers' conferences are even paid for by the lab!!!
That's to say...
It's all lit up for me.
They're looking at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the ethics of the UMP
I feel like he's being blamed for making money ???
I'm far from being one of his fans but, being blamed for hurting (or fraudulently) managing his campaign OK.
But making conferences seems to me to be a perfectly legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let's remember that her travel is handled by taxpayers.
Epidemiology Rule #1: Isolating.
All U.S. and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than political correctness.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential locations.
At what density of infection of the population will politicians resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I'm flying to Spain, and then I'm taking a plane from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola worsens in West Africa, I see them forbidding all flights and boats to the United Kingdom.
We'd always need to send goods, though...
It is a pity that the international media panic about Ebola is no longer used to talk about the less dramatic but more deadly health crises affecting the people of West Africa.
We're ALL under threat.
In every corner of the world, men, women. It's such a sad journalistic article, such a weak headline.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other (just as relevant) contexts: Women are the first caregivers - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc, etc.
So much smarter comments could have been made on how, why and where we can all contribute to a better understanding and interpretation of cultural and sociological approaches, and gender differences that could help combat Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's get started, think and write, let's not just make noise.
There's a moment for everything.
If you're not able to offer a good analysis and intelligent opinion, maybe you should just think before writing?
Although I would put female genital mutilation on the same footing as beheading — a form of terrorism that is just as barbaric, its survival rate by making it only a different form of torture — to say that its temporary suspension is a “gleam of hope” is beyond understanding.
By the way - I see the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which may give a certain degree of "validity" in his opinion, but in this case obviously it does not give a better perspective than that of an average street activist.
And I thought the Guardian was "maturating" as a global resource of journalism - advancing into the 21st century, abandoning its founding precepts.
Who, on the editorial team, lets that sound like it?
For an elected territorial or other the money does not count.
I keep reading that the territorial public service is increasing its workforce, and I've never seen an article giving them the floor or trying to explain why.
That would be legitimate, indeed.
There will probably be lies and truths, it is up to us to separate the good grain from the tares.
The court of accounts costs a lot to tell so many economic lies.
It's true they've never had anything to do with the people on Cambon Street.
TBs are not in deficit, they have financing needs that can only relate to and only to the investments they make.
By using too vague concepts the press as the World plays the game of all obscurantisms.
Debt is beneficial because it finances investment, collective wealth
Unfortunately, the debt mainly finances operating costs...
And as the over-employment of public servants (for example, to make beautiful roundabouts) leads to an increasing and uncompressible burden (a compulsory charge until their deaths, since work for life + retirement), these communities are cutting in investment.
Staff status must therefore be abolished before staffing levels are reduced.
And also make mayors financially responsible.
This is fabulous, the intercommunals should have been accompanied by a decrease in communal numbers and it is the reverse that happens, proof that adding one step is not effective without removing the others.
How do you want to properly manage large territories like peanuts at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse where these territories were created is over, it might be time to react.
No, they'd rather stay imprisoned, worse stuck, in the administrative web, it would seem!
Let's even try to garrote, It's not too strong to explain the blocking situation to which the state of the Vème led with her providential men.
It really started with Pétain.
Then went on to end up with the series "exhaled" coming up loudly about it.
Why aren't they going to live in a $250 million apartment in Monaco over a cinema to leave all this suffering behind them?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the answers like "it's the fault of the whites."
"Answers" Not "Repeats"
I sincerely hope it's sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when we hurry to be the first.
Whether it's sarcasm or not, there's an argument to make.
We now agree that the modern Homo Sapiens evolved in North-East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and during a particularly humid period about 150 thousand years ago they managed to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least the last eight thousand) is part of history.
The current Minister of Defence had stated a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So he lied.
He was probably the only one in the government who seemed to be on the road.
Now we know we can't trust him anymore.
Resignation!
2017: Conversion into a comfortable private mansion of gold closets for future pensioners of the Republic?
Moving from the floor dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: the Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for the rich and their families, the "Grand V" care of a 3-speed medicine.
We're going to save money and the military will go elsewhere to treat the little one's flu...
Do you know that 70% of patients are civilians, from all walks of life?
The London Wasps?
I pity their fans who are based in Wycombe/London.
Like the London Irish and the London Welsh?
They gave up the "London" last season.
It's just the "Wasps" now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, aren't they?
It changes that a football team uses the pitch of a rugby club instead of the other way around.
In addition, outdoor travel for Tigers and Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't make any difference.
In Stockport County, we had the misfortune to be bought by the Sale Sharks, and we ended up renting our own stadium from them once we regained our independence.
I was going to say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training in the field, although they had access to other premises, did us no favour.
I love supporting Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There's always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has a lot of fans and until recently was on the top for more than 30 years, to see its stadium taken over by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the recent CCFC problems, but that must be a good slap.
For my part, I'm not the club rugby, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who doesn't do it except a few Wasp fans at work.
They and a few thousand other people in the Southeast will probably follow them from a distance or will they now have to support another team?
Beautiful pro-domo article and good popularization.
But who cares?
But then, why not ALL computer systems are based on these concepts ???
+because a huge mass of pre-exist programs (cobol, java), +because not all systems require them, +because there is no magic wand ++....
And because for most computer systems, bugs don't really matter, what counts is being the first on the segment.
The work of G.

Real-time computing has become a key sector in many areas, and few people know the intimate details of these processes.
I haven't been to an Olive Garden for 15 years.
The price-quality ratio has fallen.
I'm sorry for those who are going to lose their jobs, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices whose popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There is already too much salt in our diets.
Don't ask Olive Garden not to put salt in the future.
Looks like they're reasoning with Let's make more profits, and not let's make healthier dishes and at the best value for money.
They think we're pigeons.
Oh, yeah, be careful that people don't have too much aggression.
And then let someone else make our soup, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's plenty of salt in it, it replaces the real ingredients.
We should also add some sodium glutamate.
The amount of salt you need to add to the pasta water is negligible, but it greatly improves the taste of the finished product.
It is not only the taste of salt, it also affects the way pasta cooks.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Everyone should try alternatives to corporate cooking.
Are there family restaurants and are they offering tasty dishes at reasonable prices?
What is happening in the United States is very sad.
A common accident at work that went wrong.
A promising young man, an apprentice thief, followed his father's career in prison for murder.
A man spoiled everything and abruptly interrupted this vocation birth.
That he is sentenced to 10 years in prison seems to be the minimum.
Where else are we going?
Totally agree!
What a humor!
The desire to solve it is obvious and difficult to excuse and blame at the same time...
Indeed, the desire to remove it is difficult to excuse.
That's why I have some sympathy for a 15-year-old.
During the trial, the kid's father complained that he would never see his son again, but that he would never apologize to the relatives of the guy he killed himself.
Who's really a victim in this story?
What do you come to mix everything!!!?
The kid's father was convicted for what he did.
Concerning the bullshit of the lost bullets, the accused and guilty, knew precisely that the bullets are dangerous.
The kid didn't do anything to the defendant!
So let him pay for the crime for which he is responsible!
Ten years, it's kind of a lot in my opinion.
For having the intelligence to shoot this young man to make noise?
Yes, it made a lot of noise!
If the opportunity arises, go on vacation in the Mosul Valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small winemakers.
I've been doing it twice, wine, landscape and food are excellent.
Moreover, if you are there during one of the many wine festivals that are held in each commune, it is even better.
I'm sorry, Moselle Valley, I hit too fast.
It's nice to see that German wine is recognized.
Importantly enough, German winemakers traditionally use only one variety of grapes, which means that they really have to work hard to maintain a certain quality.
Of course, some younger generations experiment with different grapes, as in France, Italy, etc.
It is not only the Moselle region that should be recommended - Franconia, the Rhine Palatinate (Pfalz), Baden deserve to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is like a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are of the German style (or perhaps it is the opposite, in short).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink wine after the meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during the meal, they now offer a lot, and with a much higher alcohol content than their favorite 9 degrees.
But their traditional wines bottled at the property are so complex, the sweetness is superbly balanced.
Try Schloss Vollrad's spatlee with a thermidor lobster next time you go to the restaurant.
Search Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used to use them when I had my restaurant.
Hugh Johnston's World Atlas of Wine is a great guide, beautifully illustrated.
I understand that there will be new readers of the Guardian who discover wine, but this is a recap of every newspaper article on German wine since the dawn of time.
From time to time, there is an article about German wines that are arriving, the new Baden dry ones that will now accompany the dishes, the red ones that are surprisingly vigorous, but above all, it is not these disgusting Liebfraumilch that people drank when they were young (uh, I really don't think it's always true or evocative, unless I address the over 40s - who, as I say, will have already seen all this).
Close the Val de Grace would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the lamentable state in which the Administration of France is located.
A crime against Louis XIV and a thorn in the foot of my great-grandfather and my great-grand-uncle who studied there.
In democracy, public health management should be subject to the vote of the Chamber of Deputies: the bickering of ministries held by the barbichette, and the decisions taken behind closed doors, have become unbearable.
Sorbogroin's right.
We should do as in Green Sun: euthanasia at age 70.
Moreover, we could sell the meat that will feed our poor working poor (sic) because they can no longer go to the market.
In fact, find jobs for our unemployed, real jobs, and you won't have any deficit problems anymore!
For the elderly, it has come time to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
The active, endangered, will not be able to keep this demographic transition alone...
So geriatrics, of course, but to think otherwise than a hospital model of the 30 glorious.
Now, the maximum growth of 1.5% (which has already been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the whole model defined after war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in medical matters in France: a certain rigour and discipline that we know more about in public hospitals.
If this symbol falls, we're really screwed.
We're screwed first because the rest of the hospitals aren't up to it.
The scandal is that presidents and other elites are being treated elsewhere than in the public hospital.
The solution is more in the increase in the supply of public services in other hospitals than in the maintenance of two-speed medicine.
The Val is a pole of French medical excellence, and of course a symbol.
Closing it would be a mistake, one more sign of the march towards the mediocrity of France.
Not to mention the military status, which must be preserved absolutely.
"The Hospital Day Prize", a hospital management unit, is decided by the Ministry with local supervision of the Regional Hospitalization Agencies.
The abomination of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, obviously the baby is just one of those economic refugees, he came to Australia to get a better job than he had at home.
In almost every country in the world, a child born in that country to two non-citizen parents is almost always non-citizen.
Australia goes further than most countries by making children born to Australian residents of citizens.
But Australia is being criticized because it does not meet some remarkably high standards, with obvious difficult consequences.
Why???
Seems like double standards to me.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to put an end to all persecutions and ill-treatment and war that make people flee from their country and force them to come to Australia for help.
If he doesn't want people to come by boat, then we have to solve the problem that generates this traffic.
I have nothing to complain about life in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during the civil wars.
However, the war ended six years ago and the country is returning to normal.
It all makes sense now, nimrod...!
Strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron didn't believe in this little trickery when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr Abbott...
Cameron denounced the war crimes and ill-treatment that were still taking place.
Several European countries have since put on hold the deportations of Tamils with ties to the LTTE, believing that they would run a risk of torture upon their return.
UNHCR revised its asylum assessment guidelines in December 2012 and recommended that persons with links to the LTTE be considered at risk upon return.
The year [2013] saw an increase in attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
Elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
Too late, boys!
Señor Nowak, se le ha ido el coco con tanto periodico.
In fact, this guy mightn't get even a chance to make it.
He didn't have an health insurance in the States?
So he wouldn't haven been given any treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expenses during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes later.
Specially in Texas
Ah ah ah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not long ago, we were told that the Ebola kills so fast that a large-scale epidemic was impossible (there is a whole scientific literature on the issue, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of contagion of those brought back was zero.
Stranger the more reassured we are, the more scared I am.
You have to read funny newspapers to believe that a risk can be zero.
Weak or very weak but not lame.
Finally, it is a scientific reality, the faster a virus is fatal (in general) the less likely it is to spread because the death of the host signifies its own death.
The combination of the two (high transmission and rapid death) sometimes happens ex the so-called Spanish flu.
After this is the general quarantine to save humanity. ..
There is not something obscene about making media highlights of Westerners who are certainly brave and virtuous, but at the expense of the thousands of other African patients whose profession, bravery or virtues are unknown?
Of course this highlights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help, but the repetition of announcements is of terrifying bias.
Freedom of expression, so loved by conservatives.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers of arms attacking freedom of expression and the right to privacy of Australians.
I bet they never imagined that their conservative tendencies would have robbed them of their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's one that won't do it next time.
Yes, that's exactly what we need right now, fewer health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A heating tower for when the problem actually becomes out of control.
There are already not enough doctors working in the regions around Australia like that.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy about medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new futures fund for medical research, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, would likely only be an emergency black box for the budget.
Using the pretext of noble medical research, he will raise $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope the Australian voters manage to see this excellent trick for what it is.
Tony Abbott is a lot smarter than you think.
He explains that the sale of Medibank Private is offset by the Medical Research Futures Fund.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly and a loss for low-income people.
It may be very smart, but it's not fair.
Finally, the "false rodent" and his Telstra Futures Market Fund were excellent mentors.
If it's not right, then let's show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell at the next election.
The most terrible for Nadine is still the "old personality", tasty....
I also noted it, rather corrosive as a remark.
If only it could dissuade her from maintaining a buzz on her constantly..
The worst fate for a politics at the end of a career: not to be recognized on the street.
Hello She was not recognized in her city of Toul as being sufficiently high enough to administer it.
How good is the "provincial" common sense!
We live in an odious time, Mrs. Morano.
I am of course against the wearing of the burqa, but that is not the point.
What this anecdote tells us is pure sarkozism: tiny mediocre ministers, a confusion between the function of government and the function of execution (if he could Sarkozy would come with his tonfa on each side of the road to show that he is well guardian of public order), rudeness and octopus carried to their maximum degree.
I propose that Morano, Sarkozy and all those "old personalities" who have become unworked should be granted the right to wear a firearm and a badge, thus allowing them to exercise their self-proclaimed function as vigilantes.
But who's Nadine Romano?
This is indeed the main lesson of the case: even the police have turned Sarkozy's page, perhaps they do not even regret it.
He really needs to stop before it gets awkward for him.
I envy this agent who didn't know Nadine Morano existed, if only I could do the same...
Like bob, for the shot.
Don't agree, thanks to her we laugh well ...!
Nadine, if it didn't exist, we'd have to invent it!
It's easy though, she looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde wig.
On this one, N.
Morano obviously made in contempt indeed, in contempt of the police officer she had in front of her, and who probably should have multiplied the curves and the "Yes Madam, of course Madam, immediately Madame, tell me Madam in which direction I must run to seize without waiting for this veiled woman".
"In one case, the Australian Super Hornets dropped an air attack on an Isis target when the risk of killing civilians became too great...".
Americans aren't bad at this, but I still think Isis is going to overtake them or have already done it, in Iraq at least someone counted the corpses now here nobody does.
With regard to civilian deaths on an industrial scale, nothing rivals the western war machine.
I do not agree that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (which includes non-Westerners) between the two wars in Iraq would have cost the lives of millions of Iraqis, especially children, the elderly and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war protesters I knew preferred sanctions to the "war machine" rush.
Were you also the kind of guy who preferred sanctions over prescription and men on the ground?
Very good point - the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and recklessly in recent years.
Sanctions are generally ineffective and fail to reach out to the elite - probably a reason why they have the occasional approval of the so-called Security Council.
You may recall that the insurgents did not waste any time marking their main enemy when they saw him in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on United Nations Mission headquarters that they had erected just five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place with strength and twice and I imagine with satisfaction and coolness.
As brutal and harsh as this bombing may be, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a UN mission was targeted like that.
Good point, I had actually forgotten that.
So add half a million people to the total number of deaths of Western nations (at least with recent unrest in Ukraine economic activity was directed directly to the people they intended to hurt).
It doesn't help your argument to exaggerate notoriously unreliable statistics.
The only even vaguely reliable figures on punishment-related deaths are those of children under the age of five and they are even very suspicious since Saddam Hussain refused to let objective inspectors see the facts.
It was obviously in his interest to exaggerate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable estimate is that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows that.
For additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are no better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanctioned deaths among under-fives was about 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, the number of post-sanctioned deaths may be largely biased towards this age group.
Of course it must be feared, but also the gift of gametes in general.
We must stop pretending that people were pure spirits, that love was all the children needed, and that we could do it with strangers that neither the parent nor the child might ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipus, 60% of the French do genealogy.
It is an essential and despised thing to know its origins.
Instead of pretending to be obvious and using whimsical arguments, we should explain what serious problems can arise for an adopted or conceived child with a gift of gametes.
If you were to learn that the parents who raised you did not provide the gametes from which you came, you could rely, in my opinion, because they would not have committed any crime.
The latest advances in the LDCs (e.g. uterus rootstock) are at least as questionable as a reasonably controlled APM.
The real question seems to me to be: does the frustration of the desire for children justify these acrobatics and it has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Very just as a point.
It's obvious that we need to fear the GPA, what is this stupid question?
Of course, it's sad that you can't have a child when you want one.
That's a problem I've had with my wife.
But still, it is less serious than being born very disabled or becoming disabled, contracting a serious illness, losing all his children in an accident etc.
Of all the worries of life this is not the most serious.
This is frustration among many others.
That doesn't stop us from living.
And we can always take care of the children of others!
In a society that no longer bears any form of frustration, where the child becomes a good consumer, the GPA is unacceptable to me.
The desire for a child is not a whim where one could use the other according to his good will.
Infertility requires reflection and acceptance.
