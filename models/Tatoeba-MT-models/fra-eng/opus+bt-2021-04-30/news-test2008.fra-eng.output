Inflation in Europe has derailed on food
Accelerated inflation, as measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the price increase in the 13 euro area countries was higher than forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, according to the European Community's Statistics Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts only indicated 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the policy interest rate by saying that lower interest rates, with higher commodity prices and lower unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two per cent.
According to one analyst, this is Catch 22 for the ECB: "we must deter" inflation so that we no longer have to intervene on this subject at a later stage.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent has been a record in the last twelve years and in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area took off due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Grain futures market ratings have increased by 88 per cent and soybean prices have also reached their highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price rose by 52 per cent, and last month a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, over the next 3-4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce the key rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) has increased significantly in early December. Thus, since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Survey Institute) has never seen so little socialist support before, i.e. 13 percent.
For loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of opposition voters, a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of one-fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Hungarian Democratic Forum) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent throughout the population.
Of the faithful voters some went to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate compared to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly serious has never been higher, it amounts to 41 per cent and, according to 46 per cent, the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of last spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population is planning to worsen and only one-tenth is planning to improve the situation.
Last December, 71 per cent of those surveyed, a majority never seen in Gallup's previous polls, found that the Prime Minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 per cent do not trust the Prime Minister at all and 27 per cent trust the President of Fidesz.
One indicator of political change is the proportion of society thinking that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be addressed without a change of government.
While after the riots last October, 35 per cent of those polled wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, at present this rate represents only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
When asked about the intention to vote, 60 per cent of respondents replied that they would certainly vote and the additional 20 per cent said that they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 per cent of the respondents would certainly participate and 15 per cent would probably participate. According to the current intentions, the result of the referendum would be no doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to higher education fees, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees, and 84 per cent would say no to hospital expenses.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital expenses.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by nearly twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the commercial triangle of Budaörs maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent last year, the difference being that this year the VAT rate did not increase.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas Basket also increased by 16 percent on average, a value increase well over a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, "which had already soared" in department food stores last December, have no longer risen sharply compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded by 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but the prices of turkey fillet, nuts and poppy rose sharply.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread was found from one kilo to only 139 forints.
Competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the recorded bottle of two liters of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it only cost 257 forints the recorded bottle included.
However, this year, in terms of Daily Basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its Daily Basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing last year's most expensive shopping cart with this year's cheapest shopping cart, we see a gap of 12 percent while the difference between last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices rose by an average of 1,206 forints, although the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already evident in last year's Christmas prices.
This process perplexed trade, so hypermarkets could not clearly determine what margin to apply to products as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he may lose a big profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Because of the change in the VAT rate, the increase in the prices of the Daily Basket has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than the value of the 2006 basket, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the value of the most expensive basket was 1,630 forints higher than last year and prices at the least priced increased by 1,284 forints as well.
By bringing the two Christmas seasons closer, we have seen a catastrophic price increase, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer items have increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: for some essential supplies, the Institute of Statistics has seen a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and eggs.)
According to the daily basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 per cent compared to the base.
According to the evidence, flour suppliers hold a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to get the brutal price increase also accepted by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-storage food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning important tails formed at the crates of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less significant in the provinces, many multinationals complain to the survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, caused mainly by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the Chief Medical Officer of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also save money on disinfectants
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the trauma department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected on a man hospitalized following a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured in a serious car accident came out of the hospital but shortly after he had to return there due to an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to perform an important operation because of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections from a multidrug-resistant pathogen were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, Chief Medical Officer of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
To know that it is the number of infections caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e., by methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a well-resistant bacterium that will proliferate rapidly in poor hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or prolonged functioning of the immune system, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicaemia, on elderly patients, with small weights or with a weakened organism.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily lives of hospitals.
Above all, we must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only there or we do not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the health care staff wear rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they have MRSA, however infection cannot always be prevented.
The sampling of the sample is not in mode
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not favourable to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-drug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and seniors' residences, hospitals should control inpatients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these examinations.
Most cases occur only if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the Chief Medical Officer of the Epidemiological Centre.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian directives for the recovery of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but this is not always taken into account by hospitals.
Microbiological sampling is even more rare in outpatient and basic care, Karolina Böröcz said.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical staff.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks. However, there are significant gaps in hospitals too in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, rooms are often full, beds are often too close to each other, while in terms of epidemics, patients should be separated from each other by at least 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also see that hospitals, in difficult financial situations, save on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are complied with, the number of infections is lower in a demonstrable way or the spread of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenses for social security funds, which is why this infection is being combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has identified as its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-drug-resistant pathogens (such as MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The commissioner, who was the author of a fatal accident, was not in a state of drunkenness.
The official statement concerning the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement was drawn up.
It may be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has resigned from his post since, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have led to a state of drunkenness or stunned, communicated Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation, which already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before driving.
Last Tuesday, the former chief of the 22nd district police station crushed a 55-year-old man who stood in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, in the Kossuth Lajos street of the 22nd district. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian crossing.
(In fact, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not a mitigating circumstance, according to the Highway Code, a car that starts a turn must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being taken to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and asked for his retirement because, according to police communication, this accident greatly upset him.
The investigation of this case is carried out by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Budapest.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated from the outset with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
Additional EUR 400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Minister of Finance, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements in Budapest on Friday with a total value of EUR 400 million for a credit line to support education, transport and environment infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties. This time, the contract signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The agreement on the appropriation of EUR 150 million also concerns the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, the remaining EUR 150 million will be available for use later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a €50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope primarily as part of the research and development project to be carried out at Debrecen University.
During the negotiations, the Metro Line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would discuss the possible amendment of the original contract once Hungary has finalized the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans at the EURIBOR-related interest rate, with a grace period of 8 years and no commitment fee.
Bulgaria, the paradise of the EU real estate market
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this Balkan country little mentioned in the past.
What, or who is buying from this EU market that is still the cheapest but will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses by the cheap sea.
In the mountains, the most popular areas are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nessebar but they are more and more searching for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also awaken the interest of investors and they are also more and more to buy in the very cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, offers attractive opportunities as well, commercial and office areas promise the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter seasons, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are at the same time looking to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others arrive from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the shores of the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who intend to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old dilapidated houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, proximity to a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of second homes (since last December, Bulgaria has been listed as one of the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving medium- or long-term capital gains.
The price of the capital's buildings is constantly rising as a result of increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years they have increased by 21 per cent each year.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially greater than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of professionals end on Tuesday, but Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Road Map to define the efforts to be made after the Kyoto Protocol emission reduction period until 2012.
At the moment, there are strong discussions on this issue between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, it did not wish to discuss exact figures, although it was prepared to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries commit themselves, without emission reductions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to be provided to developing countries.
The Kyoto Protocol aid fund will be managed by a 16-member Board of Directors, probably under the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), reported Piac es Profit (Market and Profit).
Six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Environment and Water Minister Gábor Fodor confirms the EU's ambition to retain its flagship role in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 from the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the "Post-2012 Agreement", and was prepared to reduce them by up to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also prepared to make commitments tailored to their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol countries had achieved a total reduction of 5.2 per cent, and all 15 EU members of that time made a commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the 1985-1987 period, our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The challenge is high in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, commitments to reduce below the Kyoto Protocol values would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need for which was stressed in the new IPCC report, an international scientific body, which won the UN Nobel Peace Prize for climate change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the Earth's average temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided, which scientists believe would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British Army units report on the video-sharing site recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with the aim of becoming popular.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has been passionate about YouTube: special units operating in Afghanistan are uploading video footage of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken with miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are monitored at the Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and then transferred to Londres or the compatriots load them on the Internet.
The political message is inescapable
Air force soldiers have already passed 139 footage online through this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as the Defenceheadquarters in the spring of 2007 and released videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Department (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were posted online to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to publicize to the general public the real objectives of the army's presence abroad.
Propaganda published through this channel costs virtually nothing compared to the usual advertising of recruitment on television, communicated to the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, but it also inevitably carries a political message since it justifies in a special form the soundness of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game
The army is bothered because, apart from the carefully censored and composed videos, amateur videos have passed through the sharing site that also present, for example, the deaths of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos had already been uploaded showing the areas of operation in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only recently been speeding up the loading of these videos.
Americans recruit a little differently using the free downloadable America's Army Shooting Game. In this game the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas raffle and donuts in ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a meeting at the end of the year with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by taking donuts and coffee.
Another ministry will host a party with live music, another will enchant public servants with a raffle and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, thus entertaining the power.
The public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it will not be the employees of the Ministry who will be invited.
At Christmas, Orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The ministry plans a budget of 25 million forints to create the year-end atmosphere.
In comparison with other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will be celebrating.
GKM's party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the six hundred employees, three hundred and fifty are expected.
During this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was organised Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) with concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost a million forints, the rest was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party which is organised with European money by the National Economic Development Centre, a company managing tenders.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté has been rented for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt as we were unable to reach the responsible person.
The suit is not mandatory
The ILO building hosted not only the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, organized a ball on the occasion of Saint Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
That ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's words of welcome and the dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the evening outfit was not compulsory at all at this ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Local Government are planning a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for 400,000 forints to its employees in its walls.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite his collaborators to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected who will be invited to have coffee and eat donuts, the press service said, the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his collaborators to have a drink in the Aula of the Ministry of Local Government and Spatial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large room, where 436 employees are expected.
He plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No party atmosphere is planned, the official character is reinforced not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on 20 January to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at the castle of Vajdahunyad, located in the town wood, and according to the communication of the ministry, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, begin with a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate at all for Christmas, communicated to [origo] the respective press services.
The press department of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than 400 people were invited to the festival at the Decorative Art Museum.
The forces of the mega strike gather
The League's trade unions and the National Association of Workers' Councils will set up their strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday's indefinite strike.
On Saturday, a general protest meeting will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant traffic congestion as rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the league's trade unions will make known the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The strike commission of LIGA - MOSZ will also be set up, it will serve as coordinator of the actions of Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, from Monday, the organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the law on health funds, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike action.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on what further action to take.
According to the National Assembly's Monday agenda, it is likely that the vote on the Health Insurance Act will take place only late in the evening or even at night.
As a result of the strike scheduled for Monday, important traffic stoppages are planned: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volán companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the track will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for strike action, the list of which is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report an indefinite strike, while others reported a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railway) and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) failed to reach agreement on the minimum services, but, as the Christmas holidays approached, more and more people were taking the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike for four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Union of Teachers have called to strike for 2 hours and 2 hours to 8 hours respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country alternating, the Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will make a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, made by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal for health reform and to submit a new concept to social debate.
The second claim requires that the new retirement calculation method to be introduced from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim seeks a guarantee, in respect of retirement before the legal age, that would allow the functions that deserve it to be transferred to the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), attached to the Unions of the League, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning the secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased country risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysis Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, set up last August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increases, in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", the society reports that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes can occur as a result of the worsening ethnic tension already existing between the gypsy and non-gypsy population of Hungary".
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy, which is likely to cause this situation, is the main reason for this.
As they say, this is due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors passed the public debate on the Roma affair to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings which based a political strategy on the dispute between Gypsies and Hungarians".
The problem is compounded, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are reinforced and the advent of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, due to the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular regarding confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following a greater publicity given to the reorganization of radical and extreme right Hungarian groups since autumn 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 calling themselves the "national self-defence association".
"The common feature of these rallies is that they define themselves as a civilian organization as they publicly declare the preparation of their adherents to defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, defence of order), armed if necessary, moreover, by mentioning the incapacity of the police, of the army, in other words of the state," they added.
They pointed out that everything was going according to the method which, based on the resentment of the political society and the parties, sought to disguise different political ambitions from a civil point of view.
The emphasis on civility and association status therefore serves only to avoid the legal traps of registering such associations in court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis points out that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policies by referring to the Hungarian Guard's constitution.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous disturbances of Roma that broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) led to the establishment of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the BNU decided to set up a guard by saying that the organization's objective is "national self-defence".
According to them, over the last 17 years, the Gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debates among Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement of some Bulgarian Roma organisations regarding the establishment of their own guard as resistance signals the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, can be seen in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of the telegraph agency, Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could impact on the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganise the working days, the number of which will decrease next year.
Holidays are not uniform in the EU and in the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes between national and state holidays and days of rest.
Rest days are often linked to religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the New Year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that the New Year's Evers can rest quietly.
Moreover, in a year, we have a total of eleven parties marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, in commemoration of the revolution of 1848, as is October 23 which is also the memorial day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on May 1 is Labor Day, and on November 1 and 2, we remember the members of our family and friends who died.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, depending on the calendar, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases where there is only one working day before or after the party marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price for extended weekends by working or going to school the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in a special regulation on replacement days for days preceding or following holidays.
The Act extends to all employers and their employees, to civil servants and to persons working in the public service.
However, it does not apply to service companies, institutions that rotate continuously and in service, by reason of their vocation, and also to days of rest.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24th, life ends almost all over the country because according to experiences the majority of people do more overtime or take vacations they have saved for these purposes so that they can spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many parties fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the first time around the Labour Day to allow employees to stay at home four days in a row.
Saturday, April 25, will be a day of work to have a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is scheduled for October 23rd: Saturday, October 18th will be a working day replacing Friday, 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year will be marked by the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can bother colleagues terribly
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that almost annoy us more: these are things that "enhance" the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether you get used to these troubles or take up the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing department," said a colleague.
That you missed a date?
At best he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In the majority of cases, the thing is arranged with apologies.
Before having painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
You're borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
You happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking otherwise they're right to be mad at you for stealing their property.
Don't bring envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there's no more envelopes and you need them right now.
Are you talking about the privacy of colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop spreading gossip.
Who did what, with whom?
Or and why?
Don't tell everyone your information (suppositions) about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don't abuse his trust!
Bury the shared information and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you declaring yourself sick without just cause?
When you call the office and you declare yourself ill on the pretext of a heartbreaking headache because you feel bad or feel you need rest that day, think of the fact that your work, your urgent business, your long-term missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to work or that something might happen that would make you stay at home, don't forget to tell your boss and colleagues to avoid surprise at your absence the next day.
Fredging, snitching, phone
You're getting into your job, but the laughing of your coworkers is pulling you out of it brutally?
You've become, unwittingly, a witness to a telephone conversation that you'd better not listen to?
Don't bother your colleagues with humping, chanting, talking aloud (that you lead over their heads), kicking, big words or discontent expressed aloud.
They can disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (drafting, design, organization).
You blame the others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the deadline set, you forget to send a mail or an important message, accuse no one for that omission!
Don't put it on the count of the possible chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you have made a mistake and if it has caused disadvantages for others, fix the mistake!
Ask how you can fix your fault, fix negligence!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Putting a jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Don't wear comfortable jogging even if your function allows!
Don't be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by putting on pretty and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're no longer interesting.
We're moving slowly in the usual morning stopper.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with electronic effects associated with it.
I'm raising the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones from earlier, then a female choir joins it like a real jewel.
Mr2 airs Zagar's song Wings of Love.
Hungarian music has not spoiled us for a long time with good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the plug becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yunderboi, the few interesting new productions born of the Hungarian digital underground are gradually beginning to change the overall picture and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he was playing himself in the Yunderboi band before he started his own way, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in one shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an ally of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the soundtracks filmed (e.g.,
The Ferenc Török season).
The early training playing in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when wan2 magazine cited their 2002 debut album among the Hungarian market's fifty largest records and proclaimed Zagar, along with Yunderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend who would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his whole became unquestionably "trendy" but nobody asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The band reacted properly, it released a new and better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, recently released, can open new avenues for them, although the title wants to represent continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line of the former group of Pecs of Balázs Zságer.
We are there with the reference to flight but next to the air music now appears, following the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the album premiere at the Millennium Park.
On the album, we find a real radio tube, mr2 Petõfi, broadcasting popular music from morning to evening recently, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
So it's all right (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: did your music remain a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The music so-called alternatives, underground can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
Now, a good pop song can be sincere too.
The reception attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audience, is either more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to the concerts and not only the young people of ten or twenty years old but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music as they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am obviously glad to see that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us music is not made to achieve an objective but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important at concerts or the mutual influence already works but it is only perceived in the elusive changes of the moment.
But I've noticed that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you won't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow the example of Yunderboi?
He works alone and has a career in the west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who trust each other's musical presence and let them deploy.
At first, it was of course inevitable that our music should be compared to that of Yunderboi because there are many of us to leave his band and take another path.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love ranks first on the list of Mr2 Petõfi.
Many people heard Zagar's name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style did you consciously open to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't plan to make a tube so we could sell the disc.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the album's finale to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why was it the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the choir with six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was later named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want that song like that or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This song had been in existence for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing from this song.
The chord sequence attracted the song's voice.
I sang the melody that the girls learned later that night.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert also it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of a brief solo by Judy Jay), they don't have a role alone, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than music, so music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were back on the stage, too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we have to forget our ego a little bit, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let those wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to also feel that euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: Actually, none of the music creation process, we had more difficult songs during the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for long, and then, little by little, everything got set up as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I have already "released" this record.
Right now, these are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader treacherous billions because of its inferiority complex
It's a cover-up fraudster.
Thus designates its former employee the French giant the Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros because of him.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be considered incapable.
Unlike all major bank houses, he recognized in time the crisis of the American mortgage market.
"He is fragile," his superiors have suggested, who have denounced him to the police.
However, if we stick to Kerviel's statement reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions produced a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year.
The crisis surpasses the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that so-called "sub-prime" mortgages, granted to low-income clients or those who had encountered repayment difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he bet.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel says, adding that he didn't, of course, keep anything for himself."
Throughout the interrogation, he confesses to having distorted the reports in order not to be screened.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex stock exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who risks nothing has nothing
Was he afraid of being discovered?
I don't think so.
"I thought the simple fact of getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where does his willingness to risk so big come from?
He only reached his post gradually.
He had started working at Societe Generale in 2000 just after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant trader and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew that he would never win as much as others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was far less considered than the others.
In view of my academic background and my professional and personal background," Kerviel told investigators.
Soon after he took office, he won his first great success.
Thanks to the Allianz shares, he won half a billion euros by betting on the decline of this title during the attacks in Londres.
And the mechanism was triggered - it wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you in peace.
"There was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors knew everything, or rather, they suspected it.
"As long as I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
It was then that the coup of the beginning of the year took place.
He's losing a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who doesn't take a vacation is a trader who doesn't want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech Government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, who could, in the coming years, contribute 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech kroner) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly DKr 125 billion from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around SEK 100 billion under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources available to the Czech Republic under these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of SEK 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, must be used to secure financial resources to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new and more efficient management methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds among the new members.
The Court upheld the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua.
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed on Thursday the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former president of the country Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released and was living under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will again be imprisoned or not, according to the AP agency, is not clear at the moment.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison agents, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or they will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemán regularly moved government money to foreign company accounts in Panama.
These were fictitious companies and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and his closest supporters.
Part of this money went into the funds that Alemán had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget has been adopted.
That's how it is.
The State budget has been adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the opposition's support.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford its refusal.
Contrary to the agitated debate leading up to the vote on the declaration of no confidence in the government, this time nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies has passed without any problem this law, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
That's kind of a paradox.
Whether you like it or not, each chapter and article is the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, although hidden behind the power competition between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that's why more attention is given to it in the media.
The arguments of politicians are much more interesting to the public than the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered three evils which the current budget is not able to address at the same time:
The first is the large proportion of the mandate costs imposed by law, constituted not only by pensions, but also by social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" bringing together the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the biggest hazard.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued stunned bonds, disproportionate debt to their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from the money from taxes, tax charges and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In previous years, they were able to repay these debts by selling in bulk the shares of the distribution systems, particularly those of the energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatizations.
Today, they no longer have this source.
Based solely on official and verifiable facts, it can be observed that:
Our economy has been going through a period of growth for several years, as has the rest of the world, and ČSSD has been selling it.
It was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were becoming more and more into the state.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls mainly on previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least threatened by poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes which, in recent years, have unfortunately been unnecessarily swollen.
Although some of the absurd populist spending, approved last year before the elections, has been eliminated, if a gap in the retirement age limit, as well as a reform of the pension system, does not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and anyone in power will only administer it.
By barely exaggerating, it can be said that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes ordinary costs to be pushed back by mandate costs.
The deficit of $70 billion projected for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the previous governments had not dissipated all the money they could.
If we really do not want the policies in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can spend only the equivalent of what it can levy in taxes and tax duties, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.
Ji-Krej-
Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
Over $100 billion will be placed on the money markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will auction $40 billion and provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual states have decided to take concerted action to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote in his report to Bernard Baumohl's customers from the Economic Outlook Group consulting company.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent," says Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unreimbursed loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are expecting further losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, it is because they have to really understand what can still follow," said ABN Chief Economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems the situation is really bad," he adds.
Central banks fear that, if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect economic growth around the world.
The Central Banks made this choice after the London interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market, was failed to fall.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the U.S., Canadian and English central banks had repeatedly lowered their interest rates in the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further decline in interest rates," says Reuters agency Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the Central Banks' approach will help to avert the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the USA.
President Klaus: Environmentalists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is expected to have a major negative impact on developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke out on the issue of global warming.
Criticism this time over the UN International Climate Change Conference in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric accompanying it and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a rocket of words, ersatz solutions to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed, when presenting his book, that his subject matter is of great importance to him, and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often only encounter the caricature of my opinions".
Now, interested persons can read its positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless has, in his opinion, enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academician capable of following and appreciating scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following: the climate is constantly changing, the changes in it are therefore normal, there is no shared opinion on global warming among all researchers, the effects of current changes are neither too great nor too serious, they therefore represent no danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence climate change are useless, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
All the more so since he had experience of a totalitarian regime, he considered it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he felt was a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against fundamentalist environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between costs and the profit they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken on this subject two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people have failed to renew their driving licence in time
Six hundred thousand drivers allowed the deadline to expire and failed to renew their former driver's licence, which expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities are able to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of unlicensed drivers will travel the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving licence, especially those who no longer wish to drive.
As municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, authorities in the capital are inundated with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has increased this week.
The Town Hall satisfies about 2000 customers a day.
There's a tail of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140 OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driver's licences.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for issuance within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who fail to carry out the compulsory renewal of the driver's licence by the end of the year and take the road without a valid licence will be liable, as of January, to a fine.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence through an amicable approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2500 kroons.
According to previous reports, even a person who was not going to travel was liable to a fine.
In doing so she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines of not more than KKK 1000.
According to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one faces fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's licence is, in his view, a document that people can decide whether or not they want to have it.
This is not like the ID card, which must be valid without exceptions.
Persons who no longer wish to drive should surrender their driver's licence.
Just bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with records from the years 1994 to 2000 still have three years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the sentences of detectives who were detained with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Kořařk, former police officers accused of conniving with David Berdych's gang, will respectively serve thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Prague Superior Court thus sentenced them definitively by reducing their sentences by 1 and 2 years respectively.
Originally, the Department's detectives for the fight against organized crime faced 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, only an appeal to the Superior Tribunal is possible.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is currently awaiting a first instance verdict.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials exceeding 16 years in prison.
He can't receive more.
In January, the Departmental Court found guilty for participation in 19 holding-ups, the Supreme Court was now dealing with the appeal interjections of 16 of them.
Since the beginning of the investigation, most of the accused have challenged the prosecution by claiming that this was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemia Court of Justice, police officers, after an agreement with Berdych and others, transferred information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang returned 30 per cent of the larceny to Opava and Kořařk.
The prosecution refers to the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robberies whose victims have, in most cases, suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of authority by a public official and prohibited armament.
During the home searches, the police discovered unlawfully detained pistols, shells with a steel core, a viewfinder for direct laser firing or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of further robbery by Berdych and a whole series of others.
Other men in Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves in court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
For the time being, the main hearing has avoided the possibility of Tomů Půta and Maroš Šulej currently in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of children's substitution: 12 million
The lawyer of the affected families Igor Veleba wants to obtain compensation of 12 million crowns plus costs from the hospital in Třebü.
Three million for each mother, two million for fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of the hospital Ondřej Dostál absolutely disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a claim, it is very high," Dostál said at the end of the hearing.
"To be able to form an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the expert report from which the opposing party commissioned the drafting.
Let's check if this one has any explanatory value.
But we continue to believe that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál said.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablořov's family asked for a million crowns for each month she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital Center in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better borne by men, although they were faced with remorse for failing to prevent the substitution of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, remain less serene in the face of the trauma in the news and in the face of what is happening precisely at the moment, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the hospital in Třebó on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablořov.
The governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil region handed over, at the end of October, to each of the families 100,000 crowns for the reimbursement of the expenses occasioned by the error of the hospital of Třebř managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are required by law to provide civil liability insurance.
In case of default, they must draw from the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask the manager for assistance.
Until now, the courts had recognized relatively small amounts of compensation, the amounts calculated on the basis of the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the trade mark Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, he was the one who had used the title "King of Valašsko" for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around the actor's former collaborator Tomň Harabiš.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are interfering with Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valašsko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comic.
Harabiš agrees.
"There is a job behind us of almost ten years.
Finding money and developing events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project is successful and that they could benefit from it.
It is they who want to parasitize our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who first used the title valašský král (King of Valašsko) on his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned him king in 1993.
However, at the time, it had no connection with the plan to establish a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of issuing passports from the Valašské Království.
From a humorous action originally emerged a lucrative business and business activity, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka agreed that his name and signature should be mentioned in the passport and he even offered the holders sales on the price of visiting his farm and his theatre shows.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the naked idea, published by Polívka in the show manež, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the project Valašské království," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and his team, which devoted itself to the project intensely.
Collaboration between today's enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated with the deposition "of King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, which the court today dismissed.
What could make the case clear is the planned tournament for the throne and half the princess.
He should get a new king out of it.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to go fast.
It would be something like the king's parade in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for some time.
Even Mr Polívka can of course register," added Harabiš.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
Actually, I've never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of gear change, driving and also that of manufacturing could, in many respects, be described as inferior to the average.
At present, however, there is its successor Peugeot 207 on the market, which is much better.
All the more so since the combi named SW goes a step further, I just have to think better.
When I was testing the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained about, for example, the head space on the back seats.
While there ended the complaints because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will be, in this respect, at ease.
Let's see what we can do.
I'm going to talk about the interior very quickly so I won't repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only comment about the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, since the car looks so elegant.
Seats are comfortable and the time when one could complain of seats or backs too short is over.
Lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in the dimensions of the bodywork is also noticeable there.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the head already mentioned disappear.
A safe in the safe
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate it as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear pivoting ice) and a rather easy stowage.
Blind spaces are equipped with stopping elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold fairly heavy objects.
But let's stop by volume.
It makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is in relation to competition a rather average figure.
Apart from the Škoda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav's product, we can see that the Peugeot remains very much behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to going on holiday abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I were to highlight the advantages, I would mention the underside remaining after the backrests of the rear seats were overturned perfectly straight, or a very low footstool.
120 horsepower spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what a 1.6 should look like that that makes a family hatchback work.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda, which often gives the impression of having a tailpipe clogged by a mop, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's go through the tariffs.
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, one must be aware that one has tested a car quite well equipped, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a 1.4-litre Otto engine of 329 900 Kč is still fair.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 Kč.
In addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, automatic rear window control...
In fact, the vehicle ultimately costs 531 900 Kč.
This is a lot, but try to add the additional equipment to the Fabia price and you will get a very similar number.
So all that remains to be done is to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils into British schools is not going well
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, raising concerns about the evolution of local education among those who remain.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of Northern Kent, where conflicts between remaining and immigrants of Slovak origin are beginning to intensify, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, chicane and fights between students have been translated into relations between parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who hit a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends herself by claiming that the boy insulted him with racist remarks.
The police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we got home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks," described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went so far as to describe conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between the original inhabitants and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak pupils attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your leave can be realized if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the repository and place of transshipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was erected in the early 1920s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, had it built, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 1950s' last century, were circulating on the broad boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
So what about today?
You can leave your own autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, we will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since once imported jigouli and fiats have for a long time already, in a climate so salty and wet, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is noticeably decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
As tourism brings the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
Over the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated especially by fans of small trains.
The cane had returned from the extended plantations in the sweets on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades, and this is how small locomotives can be seen running, the contemporary of which are not only in museums.
Towards where to direct his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the best known places.
So there is no need to write a lot about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the valley of Viřales to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation grows there on limestone soil.
Mogots, calcareous balloons and rocks ascend in candlelight from the bottom of the valley, and, with fertile soil caught in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense plant mat.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco is probably grown of the best quality.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was shot.
Trinidad
An ancient town founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It is the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought him glory and wealth.
Wealth has been embodied in the beauty and window-city character of this small city.
Koloniální španělská architektura,výrazně ovlivněná pozdějěmi francouzskými osadníky, se za čtyři staletí témí nezměnila.
Trinidad, situated between the sea and the mountain massif Escambray, is so far away that still in the 1950s' of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay aside.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everyone just had a roof over the head.
If you have more time in Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth visiting interesting places in the surrounding area, such as Playa Ancón beach or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música which comes alive after sunset and where the music only falls asleep in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village located in the far East of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads leading there from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without any signs of human activity.
UNESCO has placed the Eastern Snail of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in reality, it was born about a hundred years after Columbus' journey) and from the hill where the old castle-fort stands and the current hotel El Castillo, we see several mountains table, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the mountain massif Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Sows and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this one could fill a quantity of pages.
Only, as they say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, Americans say
The lack of soldiers and necessary equipment, according to the United States, affects the operation of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not proceed as it should, agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing protest by the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States has called NATO troops for greater activity this week through Defence Minister Robert Gates, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the Afghan government's authority and the intensification of development aid.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other being to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," said British defense minister Des Browne to the BBC channel.
Ninety per cent
The activity of Afghan insurgents is, according to U.S. military data, the most intense activity of the past five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, to 60 per cent in Helmand Province, located in the south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, almost a quarter of them in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are requesting additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
"I'm not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters agency at the end of the three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there have also been conflicts between countries involved in the issue if all allies are actually doing everything in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat demands they are subjected to are not as stringent as those in the south and east parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
This week, the British tabloid Sun called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan launderers discovered: Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a paper supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild switched to counter-attack by publishing a photo of a British troop during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The state debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
The burden of a State debt exceeding DKr 84,000 is borne by each Czech.
The total debt rose at the end of September to DKr 842.7 billion.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
As a result of better-than-anticipated changes in government budget savings, the Department has reduced the forecast to DKR 152.8 billion.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to DKr 842.7 billion.
During the nine months of this year it has therefore increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
From June onwards, however, it decreased by 13.4 billion kroons.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on the state debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech is responsible for a debt in excess of DKr 84,000.
Over the past year, the state has incurred more than SEK 111 billion in debt.
"For the time being, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit forecast for next year, we could cross the border by only a trillion crowns in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for the iHned.cz server.
The forecast of Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor is similar: "One could exceed the trillion in 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene was changing, that policies were prepared to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I am not waiting for this change," he said.
Debts grow
The debt of the State consists of the debts of the central government and is generated mainly by the accumulation of deficits in the State budget.
The government's debt is financed by treasury bills, rents, direct borrowings or, for example, borrowings from the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic debt has risen this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's external debt has risen this year from DKr 1.7 billion to DKr 123.3 billion.
The debt of the State called negotiable reached at the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average debt liability of the State amounted to 6.5 years.
"Total debt increased inter-annually from the first to the third half of the year by 13 per cent, which, given the current healthy economy, is far too high.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated by annuity securities, where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand this indicates that there will be room to negotiate when pension reform comes," commented Pikora data.
Better than we expected.
As a result of the government's strategy for financing and managing the government's debt for the year 2007, the government planned to borrow DKr 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of September, however, thanks to better-than-expected savings in the state budget, the Ministry reduced the planned amount to DKr 152.8 billion.
The sum consists mainly of the deficit in the State budget, which is clearly going to reach DKr 76 billion this year, instead of the originally planned DKr 91.3 billion.
Secondly, these are the maximum planned sources for the Czech consolidation agency, namely DKr 13.3 billion, the reserve of DKr 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state pensions for DKr 43 billion and repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to DKr 1.8 billion.
She was appearing today before a court in Khartoum for appointing a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and deportation, his lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of leaving students between the ages of 6 and 7 to give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was punishable by lashes.
This 54-year-old British teacher at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with violating Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the class's teddy bear.
"Eight names come out of the mouths of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with a picture of the bear followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not carry any label with this name, but the problem is simply the representation of the prophet as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name", he says it is only an "innocent mistake".
Opinion shared by many of the teacher's students who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never talks about religion in the classroom".
Recall that the first name Mohamed is also the most given middle name in Great Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, they did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final session of discussions on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach a status agreement," said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake”, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to honour their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence in the immediate future, but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist."
Mediation terminated on 10 December
The Troika mediators, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the Troika was entrusted with a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, Westerners believe that EU-supervised independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina expresses its readiness to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," announced the President of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovar rebellion and future premier of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to a past that led to murders and deportations".
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic considered that a compromise was always possible, warning the majority of Kosovo's Albanians against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
In particular, Belgrade says it fears a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia," he said, "it does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be left exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a right of veto.
“The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word”
"Only a solution in the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.”
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking people would be "in consultation" with the Westerners.
Bush rips off an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference convened by him on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately with a view to finding a final settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must put an end to its settlement activities," Bush said, recalling both parties' obligations under the "road map" for peace that they accepted in 2003.
The White House leader stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "at concluding a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues."
This name covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven out of their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and thorough" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others".
Going up to the rostrum, Olmert pledged that the forthcoming talks would be "direct and continuous" and to make an "effort to close them in the course of 2008".
Bush set the deadline at the end of 2008 for the implementation of his "vision of two states" of Palestine and Israel that coexist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment to that effect from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was a success for Washington, was at the origin of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offered Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it tackles the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", according to Prince Saud in his interview with the Arabic-speaking daily newspaper with Saudi capital.
For the D.A., the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As every time in this type of fact various, official versions and rumours oppose each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was travelling on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., on Louise-Michel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in intervention but on patrol, and was travelling at 40-50 km/h, without a gyrophare," says a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, “not approved, so not allowed to run on the public road” (see below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was running “very fast”.
"She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority to the right," says one police officer.
The blood alcohol check performed on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (before stoned, star windshield, bumper torn) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very soon, yesterday morning, the public prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "facts of manslaughter and non-assistance to persons in danger" to the IGPN, co-located with the departmental directorate of public security of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, excluded the responsibility of the police officers.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, heard on Sunday night, confirmed "the police's version, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled while the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, there was a rumour in Villiers-le-Bel that the police officers had quickly left the scene, thus not helping the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out "any serious fault" concerning this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation, on which we must be very careful," one police source said.
Libération met with an eyewitness of those moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows looking exactly at the scene.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them," said this witness.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw "a completely hagard policeman, who was drinking.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently with the certainty that those present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to this witness, the aid arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left".
They also performed heart massages, in vain.
"I will not let it be said that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
Firefighters arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor pointed out.
Tension rises in Pakistan
The Pakistani police on Monday repressed the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who were protesting against the measures taken under the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement officials, according to witnesses.
They responded by throwing stones, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers loaded and injured lawyers.
Several of them were reportedly arrested.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced protests, following a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other demonstrations reportedly took place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement garnered the support of the religious parties grouped together in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president urged the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and trash to those who took oaths before Musharraf'.
''Musharraf's promise no longer stands'''
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly affected by the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday night.
In the coming days, it was expected to decide on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election to the presidency on 6 October, by indirect vote.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
''Everything we see is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court'', the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president ''no longer holds'' after the establishment of a state of emergency, said Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to abandon his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf had been placed under house arrest by his deputy chief of armies.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unanticipated
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) are not planned, reveals a study conducted by the Institut national d'études démocratiques (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Different methods of contraception such as pill or IUD still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception has nevertheless led to a better “control of fertility”, according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 years has increased from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
It is calculated to the nearest month for one in five couples and if possible in the spring, which is considered to be the most pleasant season to have a child.
Spectacular repair on space station
It took more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, indispensable for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky release that has accumulated the records because of its duration, its remoteness from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools "bricoled" by astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday as astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle, a large cylindrical room to soon host the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of dock for laboratory modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew's second task was therefore to move a solar panel power generation module weighing 17.5 tonnes, already present on the ISS, to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the redeployment of the solar panels from the module, which have a wingspan of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged about a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment was stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally required to perform a control exit from the Discovery Shuttle and then go and repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to caracole at the end of the 30 meters of length of the remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" in the Nasa.
Large, resistant, very skillful, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At 46 years of age, this training physician was therefore tasked with "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he severed the faulty cable and installed some kind of "claps" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" remaining near the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a hockey mini-cane wrapped in insulation to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "briccoled" by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making an inventory of his tools and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
EADS action is currently down on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the Aeronautics and Defence Group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its operational result forecast for 2007 due to delays caused by the slow progress of the A400M engine development, which conditions the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros including more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating results targets (EBIT) for 2007 when its quarterly results are presented next Thursday, he adds without any further details.
The group also indicated that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS' operating result fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to expenses related to delays in another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
There will be no suspense, Sunday, at the exit of the ballot boxes: the Russians will overwhelmingly opt for President Putin's party, united Russia.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends a televised message to voters on public channels, which are already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the United Russia list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory promises to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the President did not let this happen by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with handing over a new charge against the West accused of interference - its favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and wish for fair, transparent and open elections, free elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from counting.
It denounces a campaign tainted with pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganov says there have "never been such dirty elections, even at the time of Yeltsin".
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, former chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains banned from visiting according to her lawyer.
"Russians kept homo sovieticus mentality"
Behind these unsustainable legislation are two much more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin as President?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, on 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, in both legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada centre.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St Petersburg State University goes back: civil society has fallen behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin returned to the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population all the more since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility" they had briefly shown after the break-up of the USSR.
“What’s the point of thinking?”
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for extremists either.
Conclusion by 54-year-old Tamara Cherednitchenko: “What is the point of thinking?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in open access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen, Hesse, were so far only searchable for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his successors in title.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including France, Germany, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow research to be carried out "in particular on the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, were opposed to the public opening of these nominative documents because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of the concentration camps or arrest warrants drawn up by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, possibly, to prove their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are processing tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
EU and India want free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The EU Foreign Ministers gave their green light last April to the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asea). Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will greatly boost both economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," argued Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants trade annually for "47 billion euros in goods" and "10 billion euros in services", said Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi this week, regretting that bilateral trade has "not yet reached its potential". The EU and India meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England notes concerns by offering £10 billion over five weeks
The bank of England said on Thursday that it was keen to ease the current return of concerns about credit terms, and announced an offer of £10 billion at a base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"To ease concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve provision during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she says in a press release.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time that BoE appears to be placing liquidity on the market at five weeks in an open market operation.
These are normally done within a week.
BoE adds in its press release that it "stands ready to take further steps to maintain rates" of interbank loans on a day-to-day basis in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, a higher rate since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England had been accompanied by a large penalty rate which had deterred banks from using it.
According to rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the price of the pound compared to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse consideration of PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss the articles of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Listed in a socialist "nice" (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS national office, including the 50% increase in the employment premium, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport cheque or the supervision of rents.
As UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was adjourned following the general discussion which gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between the majority and opposition a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of the MPs PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is emerging
Following numerous rumours about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with British producer Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
"For our company, it's an honour to work with someone who has inspired the current festival movement in America," said Charlie Jones of C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is scheduled to be held from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which annually attracts some 80,000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006 Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also co-owned the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury "the most inspiring event" he's ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We chose Philadelphia as a market and worked diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we got stuck in politics because of the current administration, says Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to chat with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a superb festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after standing out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while ours are held in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both a rural festival impression to the European and urban American."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are interesting enough to allow investment in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the reception capacity of this festival is "very large", like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been issued to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of going to press.
"Vineland will be rock-flavored, but the music will be varied, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award at the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film sets to Montreal when no one other than Terminator opposes it...
This mission of seduction is part of the duties of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the hands of the "Governator"?
"You have to be careful, it is the industry that decides where it is going.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal favourable, she will go.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best," he says.
The Festival Race
For the time being, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of local cinema.
The Oscar race has begun.
It will be at all festivals in the West Side, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, a question of presenting Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that directors do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also featured four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock exchange? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks from the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands hoping for the arrival of the traditional rally at the end of the year.
However, this year the experts are not as sure as this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December on the stock exchange generally has a positive attitude.
However, forecasts should not be made exclusively on the basis of statistics, since, given the current context, uncertainty is on the market, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock exchange gaining momentum in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is nourished by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of leakage to quality values both in long periods and in short".
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will behave rather lateral, not free of volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulating inflationary pressures"
Javier Barrio, responsible for sales of BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"That's not the best thing," says the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish stock market index, has lost almost 4% since 8 November when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
However not all experts have such a negative view.
Intermoney analyst Juan Solana believes that Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to portfolio reorganization and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuance that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Feast of the Constitution (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Banco, estimates that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be provoked according to the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new maximum cottes.
Intermoney's Solana says that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco assures that the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they get involved.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be the main contributor in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do as well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the past seven years, only on two occasions in December has been a low-income month.
The authentic end-of-year rally took place in 2003, an exercise during which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the explosion of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of winnings (for the time being the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it manages to computerize on its rally at the end of the year.
Banque Populaire will open 200 offices open at 12 noon from Monday to Saturday.
The Banque Populaire has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a great change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m., and to open on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
He is about to enter into an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the Banque Populaire's experience will be decisive for other organizations to join or not to join this initiative, which coincides with business schedules.
This is precisely what the Banque Populaire is looking for.
Attract autonomous customers who travel in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and street shops chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies located throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not the opening of new agencies but a renovation of those already in existence.
To do this, the agency will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on the various streets.
In this way, the amplification of schedules is accompanied by a different design from the inside of the branch and a new, more current, design with brighter colors.
The bank's sales manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renovation does not involve major investments, but the hiring of staff, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three Madrid agencies.
And the experience was positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets of Madrid are the streets to be chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and public holidays.
In these agencies of PopularMax they will not copy the model of the BBVA, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for its sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers', Rivero notes.
For the time being, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff external to the bank.
Telecinco first doubles the market value of its rival Antena 3
We did it.
With this sentence Paolo Vasile, a delegated advisor to Telecinco, expressed yesterday his satisfaction, at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the channel he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect tarnished his joy: 'What hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have decreased less', he said.
However, he emphasized the fact that in a small market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain stabilizes its loss to 15.66 per cent over the past year.
The market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (an additional 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival Antena 3, who gave in yesterday 1.52% and who has accumulated a 40.5% drop since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
In the case of Sogecable, the value of the other publicly listed co-munication companies amounts to 3.571 million; in Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) 2,518.53 million; and in Vocento 1,779 million.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, on the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience'.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television channel to surpass the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the associate advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group.
To ensure that this information is true, the television channel is expected to record an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing for the current fiscal year compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, Antenne 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the fiscal year (to reach $734.4 million) while television's net revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that the annalists point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the important pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
'We have the official compromise of giving a minimum of 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given securities with the 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in projected revenue growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company decreased the forecast of Antenne's earnings from 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and from 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities recommends that both values be purchased based primarily on its significant dividend profitability and long-term sustainable potential.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the Congress' vote on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the effort made by members of Parliament and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of organizations to ensure that markets function effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Law, involves the modernization of the financial markets, at a time when it strengthens the protection of the investor, improves the powers of the executives of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulations will provide financial consulting services for both specialized social reasons and for natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (FICs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and holding companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments, so that multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems can be added to regulated secondary markets, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment services companies to disclose information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management to the market and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they carry out to facilitate CNMV's control.
Through the Congressional Economic Commission, several changes have been added, including one that highlights that tenured debts will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has proven itself with what happened with the high-risk (subprime) US mortgage debt.
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the management has taken advantage of the legal delineation of the functions that graduates in Economics may be 30 years after in 1977, was approved, the royal decree which delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require CNMV's authorization and who will be able to provide its product marketing and new customer attraction services to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index rose by five-tenths in November, up to 4.1%.
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the rate of inflation in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The leading indicator is calculated using the same process used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available for publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is indicative only, because it does not necessarily coincide with the final data to be released on December 14.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and the Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, claimed that the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "time figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes specified in the Congressional corridors that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential over monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November “there was less surprise” than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4%," the Minister of the Economy acknowledged in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock €42,000 million over three years
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen to over 50% to £12,000 million (16.800 million) since it entered crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emerging credit from the bank of England.
At that time he collected some record deposits above £25,000 million, a figure that gradually dropped in two and a half months due to the distrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of that money that the Government offered and that he will keep until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the organization with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues of British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get that remaining £18,000 million until reaching the target of £30,000 million.
The magnate group Richard Branson, known for its Cree advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend £50 million (about €70 million) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the offer of Virgin's association, in which three other companies participate, including his favorite to save him from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today in the early morning the current mayor of the Murcian commune of Totana (of the People's Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption network discovered this week.
Ade plus, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced the me of last May Juan Morales, current right-wing deputy, and until then municipal councillor of the town hall, and which according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Channel, could be the 'leader' of this frame.
The officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urban Council and the possibility of further stops is not ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect in the urban corruption pattern, discovered earlier this week, was charged.
As reported yesterday by the SER Channel to the lawyer of the MP 'of the People's Party' Juan Morales, he was arrested on leaving Morales's home with important documentation in his possession relating to the frame.
Moreover, according to sources of the investigation, the purpose of the investigation is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight detainees.
Bono agrees to be the head of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the elections
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress in case the socialists win the general elections.
Thus the organizing secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal seat of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer to the former Minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the Manche politician will be the candidate of the Socialist Group which will preside over the Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, who announced on November 15th his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the academic setting.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
Moreover, he pointed out that, although citizens already know who the vice-president of the economy will be if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to transform the House into a "house of respect and not insult or scream" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems lamentably that the only facility in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times".
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know-how" and he did not want to act as if he was already occupying his position so as not to fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might consider to be "a domination".
Climate propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change is subject to unmerciful persecution both the skeptics of its predictions and those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron consistency.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has made a decisive contribution to Spain's leadership of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who is responsible for non-execution, in what sectors has it occurred and why its Government, the Government of the World Contract, has not avoided it.
Moreover, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be forced to do, what economic consequences will this have.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has been and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it's about sacrifice and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costy, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of businesses and individuals.
Up to one hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him to be readerly so dangerous in Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is a question of saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With phrases that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for the electoral campaigns that do not speak, do not denounce and do not demand, embellish the meetings and inspire tenderness.
Provided that this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party and that does not claim that we are travelling by bicycle or cooled down with the fan.
Mayor and local police chief of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the Town Hall and a hotel entrepreneur suspected of possible urban offences, today informed the sources of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the town hall, where at the moment many agents met, who also ran for the Municipal Councillor of Urbanism and the municipal company of management of Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 housing units, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial inquiry, that Tribunal No. 1 of Totana investigated.
The first six detainees have now moved to a judicial disposition.
According to sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and currently an autonomous MP of the PP party, Juan Morales, is the subject of the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was imputed, as was the current fiancée of the former city councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and the entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, an agency of the Nuaria Group, through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies linked to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
So only one person was arrested in Totana, in sum, the owner of a well-known poultry business in the area, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian town of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were requalified and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's commentary in Finland's most important newspaper (some of which are at the top of PISA information above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, the same day that he appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Philosophy course challenged public opinion as a consequence of the Jokela school tragedy.
The culprit of the dead, a bachelor's student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Counsellor in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat and he affirmed that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools ".

A colleague reported on the introduction into the Penal Code of crimes related to Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be an offence punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft from a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros is considered only a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Stealing from a store for a value of up to 1,000 euros is already considered an offence, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than that imposed for downloading (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would involve a sentence of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. Distribution of films protected by copyright and without authors ' permission is more punishable than distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).

My attending doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less '.
That is, the feelings generated by workers' monthly pay depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted using tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the neurocognition images group of the Life&Brain Institute, Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed".
The researchers observed that when both people knew that they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received the double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte for eight years has relentlessly pursued Balkan war criminals from the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will go away with bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former leader serbobosnio Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in this list whose documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'Carla's list' (2006, not screened exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, who follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor in Belgrade in New York who pursues fugitive criminals and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What assurance does it suit me?
Motor insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible claims, involves a significant expenditure which will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driver's licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
Y es que, escoger el seguro de automóvil adecuado es incluso más diffícil que elegir el modelo de vehículo.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in return becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a loss.
The premium is the price of insurance, which takes into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driver's licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the score to be paid.
It is for this reason that people over the age of 25 and women must pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower rate of claims due to their prudence.
Similarly, using censuses, the companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency and thus the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That's why the driver needs to study the situation carefully to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face a variety of disadvantages when entering into a contract with insurance at an affordable price, as can be the low experience in driving and the seniority of the driver's licence.
Although the ideal way to be well insured is risk insurance, other, more cost-effective options exist.
The most forward-looking drivers can opt for any risk insurance with a deductible, so that they get coverage from any risk insurance but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be determined according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," says Luis Noguera, the Spanish head of First Europa, an online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under 25 years of age try to be careful and avoid claims to the extent possible, since this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the company's basic rate.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
"The subsidies and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses", clarifies Noguera.
Beyond the age of 25 this becomes easier for drivers when contracting with insurance, since the loss rate is reduced thanks to accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is preferable to choose an all-risk insurance with deductible.
"Normally young people cannot take advantage of the experience acquired in advance after an accident", says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable for the client to negotiate insurance at any risk, as long as his or her economic situation allows him or her to do so.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be those with the lowest claim rate, because the increases will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be any risk insurance with deductible (may be 300 euros), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more relaxed drive and they have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of assuming a larger amount of franchises," says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, a risk-free insurance policy is preferable (i.e. 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance policy when the insurer has a high level of subsidy.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents a major expense, which is why it is essential to study properly the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will seek to win a point in Milan to arrive at the eighth of the finals
The Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow compete next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to classify themselves.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to make sure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass him.
These two Group D games will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC is due to play the semi-finals of the Clubs World Cup in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a spot for the December 16th final.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium seems to be the most awaited result, although both teams will try to come out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would stay first and ensure a better cross in the eighths of the final.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to rank if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but she won't be able to compute only on that since with nine points the game returns to the Ukrainians, who lost last week to Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scottish, who have good hope of ranking for the eighth finals for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten in the last edition by a Kaka goal during the overtime (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to the Shakhtar, in case the Celtic loses, to rank for the eighths of the finals to be able to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that the Benfica, although it is last and without possibilities to continue the European competition, could reach third place with a win.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls initiated their first tour since the band disbanded in 2000 in Vancouver, Canada, ahead of about 20,000 spectators.
' Posh Spice ' (Victoria Beckham), ' Scary Spice ' (Melanie Brown), ' Baby Spice ' (Emma Bunton), ' Sporty Spice ' (Melanie Chisholm) and ' Ginger Spice ' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before they started their concert at the GM Place Stadium in Vancouver that the band's meeting is "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people have exhausted the tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which is told the story of the band that raged at the end of 1990.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls went on stage showing the bracelets that 'Posh Spice''s husband had given them, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days before.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show".
'Sporty Spice', which was part of the band in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and which caused the band to be disbanded two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the show began.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feelings have changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," said Chisholm about the group meeting that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, "things have worked out and we really appreciate each other."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last showed up in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of babysitters were waiting for them.
She has five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band exhibited in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will exhibit on December 23.
The new gas affair between Russia and Ukraine throws the alarm.
A dispute over the price of fermented gas between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of repercussions on oil exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are transported by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two caused a decrease in supplies to the EU countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow arises after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, the Russian-owned monopoly gas company, tried in vain to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase as planned, its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said that this would involve for Ukraine, a 40% increase in the costs of imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas passes," the Ukrainian Minister of Economy, Anatoly Kinkh, told the Reuters news agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused the interruption of Gazprom supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, thus increasing prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve controls on its extra-community employees to check if they have criminal precedents, the Monitoring Committee said.
Reviser General Robert Black's warning came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health has no precise data on the number of overseas workers it employs.
His report nevertheless highlighted other decisive checks, correctly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The reviewer-general conducted checks on extra-Community personnel following the Glasgow airport attack.
Bilal Addullah, 28, an Iraqi-born doctor serving at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after darking with his jeep, in the gates of the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who were filmed at Old Bailey in October, as suspected of being involved in various attempts to explode cars in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, in order to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out checks on criminal precedents, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office of Control of Criminal Precedents, thus allowing employers to undertake controls over various countries.
"Although we have discovered that some personnel information has been verified, this is not done every time."
Mr. Black stated that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks he would do himself, but he also added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information about some overseas staff is available to the health services.
Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland said it is "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls will be able to identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring any added value."
Scottish health authorities reported employing 1,161 overseas workers, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the reviewer-general stressed that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, partly because of problems in identifying staff members with indeterminate contracts, who may or may not choose to stay in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures for health authorities' checks in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its policy and system of pre-employment checks for staff members in the health service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, allied to the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, valid for all employees, including overseas workers.

But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, won two awards, the first as best director and the second as best beginner director.
The Rock was also awarded with the Best Documentary Award for Julien Temple's film on Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor Award was presented to Viggo Mortensen for his performance of the driver of a Russian mob boss, in the London-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone known for his tough character performances, won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old director, having shot films such as Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of Cristal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award named in honor of star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney allowed people like me access to the cinema," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris well twice."
"I was admired by this great actor today, I was extremely honored"
The Oscars for the independent film, better known as "the Bifas" are awarded by a jury composed of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Among Bifa's fans and bosses are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom
Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 activists involved in organizing cells manipulating an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on ecclesiastics and the armed forces.
State television of the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the missile smugglers' cells.
Al Qaeda supporters staged a campaign against the Allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in Orientale Province, TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 military personnel to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper citing a statement by the Minister of the Interior, said that 18 of the arrested persons belong to a cell headed by a "missile launch expert" who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counterband of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 of the detainees appear to have plotted the murder of clergymen and armed forces.
The government has asked the clergy to do more against Saudis directed in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting against the Allied Forces and against the Muslim Shiite government allied to the United States, considered heretic according to the Saudi Arabians' hard line Sunny.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clergymen have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government, by Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five months," said the Minister of the Interior's spokesman on state television.
Among the detainees, there are 16 members of the Medina organized into a "media cell" aimed at promoting "takfiri thought", the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against unfaithful and apostate Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 people are accused of subsidizing activists.
Venus' climate could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to the Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those of the Earth, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with slower rotation, led Venus to a whole different kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface warm enough to melt lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the probe of the European Space Agency, which studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of the potential future of the Earth due to catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We are beginning to understand why Venus' climate is so different from that of the Earth, although the planets themselves are virtually similar.
"Our new data allows us to establish a scenario according to which billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to the Earth, perhaps even with a living area."
Enriched uranium sequestered by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was sequestered by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer stated that three people had been arrested and that the equipment was currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it is uranium, but revealed that the commodity would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to anything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to it as a presidential candidate, to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who have registered their questions, submit them to candidates.
On Wednesday evening, 28 November, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as that from another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked the Democrats their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers have very much reflected the conditions of the Republican party, the candidate for the next election.
We don't know what criteria CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose You Tube clips to show candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest one-themed debate, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strongest topics for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to phone when they would hear pleasant things: The board noted increases in approval when candidates spoke rudely.
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who led the important early elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when asked if they would be willing to promote "amnesia" (offering clandestines a regular status and the possibility of becoming citizens).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, succeeded in deepening this topic.
Neither of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps due to the fact that they have begun to fight immigration before and in a more incisive way than others.
In general, candidates, at least regarding immigration, have the same views: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, combined with concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears towards the outside world, favour Republicans to forget, or to minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether to put water in the nose should be considered torture.
One speaker asked if the candidates believed in the Bible in its entirety.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure to believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee was not expected to be in a pole position in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism, to declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When one insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he started laughing and said that Jesus is too chic to run for election.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Huckabee's return to Iowa coincides with recent prodigious grant searches by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistling during Wednesday's debate.
These two have emerged from nothingness, thanks to the fact that the party's two protégés cannot agree to decide who is the best known and more traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly thanks to a message of success on American grandeur thus bringing the leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The pains of the Labourers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole to sink into; Even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the tendency of British scandals, it is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra marital finger sucked.
But now a revelation attests that a wealthy businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have gone well with.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister turned back on his election project, foolishly insulting British intelligence proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democrat leader, said that the terrifying Mr Brown turned from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The takeover of Northern Rock, a struggling bank on the edge of the crack, demonstrated a flaw in guidance and poor judgment in an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from the tax authorities, revealed an incredible administrative bourde.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: they proclaimed that being Minister of Defence is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of suspicious donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of Labour (and his former head of vigilance) have made it necessary for them to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is bound for the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and don't trust them, but usually leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he risks suspension: the public administration no longer works; the cabinets of ministers take stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and without any further objective.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his superior lieutenant.
Problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, relate to Mr. Brown's decisions as Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's misfortunes, such as the long investigation of party funds "cash for members of the House of Lords", voters might think the opposite.
But Mr. Brown's difficult situation isn't as tragic as it looks.
The gaffes are not so monstrous as members of the Tories party make them believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no casualties or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to realize Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies of always, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal about political donations is a good example.
Abrahams, a very particular character, who compared his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it's not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the big political subsidizers are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr Watt, who stated that he was aware of Mr Abrahams' programmes, without knowing that it was illegal, would therefore have to be questioned, as would Jon Mendlesohn, the grant collector who had spoken about questionable donations in October.
But so far Mr.Brown is not involved: There is nothing to suggest that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made as a result of his arrival in government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned the legislative flaw of his party, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power rests on something he knows well, resorting to a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been flouted, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chair for the Independent Committee of Standards of Public Life, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financials of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, at a time of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to forsake its particular financial relationship with confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face certain partisan facts.
The Conservative party now has a good advantage in elections; it has two years to win back voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see fanned fins, swirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in costs and insolvency rates, which measures the shares of the balance sheet that are not recoverable or that are recoverable, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its credit to the consumer, partly because of the weakness of cardholders.
It's still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% in the third quarter is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in laws in the United States in 2005 regarding personal bankruptcy caused a steep fall in bankruptcy archives, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and hence insolvency rates) could increase even if loan conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is fairly strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
TowerGroup's Dennis Moroney, a research company, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debt now that fair mortgages have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of cash than to the value of wealth, and therefore the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily led to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; therefore, credit card debt would become a priority to pay back.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid recovery of shares.
"We're not gonna wake up one morning and re-evaluate all the borrowings," said Gary Perlin, Capital One's director.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly face a macabre future.
Pay careful attention to dorsal fins..
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were to testify to their roles in relation to a fraud committed by Enron's previous financial director, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially declared themselves innocent of the seven charges of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam in order to enrich themselves in spite of their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all found themselves guilty of committing fraud.
The three ex-executors of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous throughout Great Britain because of extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains a pending issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 made Fastow understand that he was the subject of the government's investigation into Enron's debacle.
The accusations against the bankers, nicknamed the "Natwest Three" claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his ex-right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of a Fastow-controlled Enron partner, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him rig bankruptcy proceedings.
By early 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought interest from the subsidiary's bank for £1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 as interest for this company.
According to the accused, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspiracies in Enron's debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following the payment of a $1 million bond each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even propose its bogus speculations as profitable.
The collapse resulted in thousands of layoffs, over $60 billion in market value losses and over $2 billion in retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former general president Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
Lay's charges for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were in vain because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
No money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel autonomy to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"Even if no one really needs as many seats as it is more a family aircraft or for the president of a company".
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Salon des Millionnaires, a four-day consumer incentive orgy held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to cars filled with diamonds like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was looking at a brilliant orange Porsche, displayed next to his stand.
"It's a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market".
"Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, such as Dallas"
"We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar from the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University."
Like Saudis in the 1970s, Japanese in the 1990s, Russians emerge as the world's largest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are composed of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are worth $670 billion overall, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists from the economic and financial research center.
(The World Bank said that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweller.
She participated in the show for the first time with the Russian distributor, Le Groupe Bijoutier de Soho.
"Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune."
Walking through the living room on Sunday night, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 claim to be like their customers, millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and tried to choose between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who grabbed her haute couture dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems primarily aimed at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue up in traffic to come to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum canifs, Mövenpick ice creams, personalized pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears are exposed.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands," said Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal factory stand for Dutch porcelain Delf, in front of a Raimbrant wall panel on blue tiles, handmade.
"it is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, sellers have stated here that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years old are too much according to Russian standards) have already switched from brilliant logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not sell at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, either millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, survey the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton inlaid with gold threads.
On the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said that he sold to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be encrusted with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, does not necessarily drive with such tires," said Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you'd already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if it wasn't in cash," he said.
"there's more than you could think of."
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian property management company.
The company erected four stands representing the British telephone booths, filled with counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passers-by stopped to throw masses of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or taking a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel millionaire," said Mr. Karyev.
Non-accredited surgeon suspected of homicide in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston was looking through the window at Just a Little Healthier restaurant and watching an ambulance just stopping at the gates of the white Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's when I realized someone died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the head of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if the cause of his death is due to an act performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, whom police have not yet identified, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are waiting confidently for the results of the toxicological tests which, unfortunately, will take time, but which should resolve this mysterious death which saddened the senior ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo was the assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," McCarthy said about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"she was like a pit bull"
"she would have done everything to protect me"
McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she left two 14- and 11-year-old sons, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesman for the Union County Public Prosecutor's Office, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died due to an unauthorized surgical operation.
"It's a possibility to consider."
"the investigation is continuing."
Authorities said they arrived at her house around 3:00.
and found Miss Arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are looking to see if any part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Miss Castro's house where a faded rose rests in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked in the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a shed, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two all-terrain bikes hung on the sides.
McCarthy said that since arriving in Newark 25 years ago at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
"She said "you have to pay attention to this," he said.
"She was there when I arrived, and again when I left.
"It was embarrassing"
It is everyone's hope that the Federal Reserve will lower the rates associated with the strong global stock market.
The shares were exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm down the credit conditions, subsequently reducing the interest rates promoted by the soothing statements of the vice president of the American central bank.
Stock markets explode in London, New York and all over Europe after Donald Kohn, #2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said those who decide, must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in troubled financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets in view of these new credit-related pressures, Mr. Kohn stated that the recent turbulence has partly "inverted certain improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
In the event that this severe turbulence persists, this would increase the likelihood of future rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as an obvious signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into the U.S. markets, and that further reductions in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped to calm Wall Street with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest decline in real estate sales for the month of October.
The repercussions of this financial turmoil have been accentuated following the statement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will dismiss 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to the losing bets of real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in Londres, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones' industrial average increased by 331 points, or 2.55% concluding at 13.289.40 while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points or 2.7% concluding at 6306.2 adding more than £39 to the value of UK companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted as a result of the strong demand for a monthly sorting fund auction from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressures on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and to inject outside funds into London's financial markets, causing credit tensions, led to the fact that the monthly "Libor" borrowing rates of British banks, caused their highest growth since last September, at 6.59% following a sharp rise since 12 November.
England faces a call for judgment against the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We face two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the number six drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as wide as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the breeders who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because Hugh Morris' office, the president general manager of England, starts filling out the application forms to become a national breeder, at least part-time.
Whoever fails to win the No. 6 bib will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is also unfair.
It is never easy to annihilate what allows a man to reach the top of his profession while another will never arrive beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than for lack of ability.
It is not only in cricket that the selection is difficult, because in the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is it a good time for Bopara to emerge?
Is it just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, who chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new executives with good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is room for only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless he is given at least one chance?
The figures are important not only in decisions but also in opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the one-day cricketer.
But capturing the eyes of selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in good shape and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 laps to win a place.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
If it is Shah or Bopara who will play at the Asgiriya Stadium, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and did well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricketer of the Test, despite the fact that his double-cent scored against Australia in Australia could still be underestimated.
The probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and will favor Shah's greatest experience against young Bopara's exuberance.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable debut in the 88 Test in Bombay, 32 cents first class versus six for Bopara, who at 22 years old is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at launch.
But Shah made only ten rounds in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test to Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that, the immediate rejection by the breeders when Vaughan again in shape, claimed his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his so obvious impulses in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy of living.
Nothing frightens him on a cricket pitch and he exaggerated when he recently rolled on a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, England's sponsor.
He reported only minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his partner who looked at him from afar, to ask him if "he had seen this?"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his spinning look allows him to do services that fit him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe it's the real art of selection?
I would be apt to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, it will be him who will play this weekend.
Buses take people back to work, and fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dumping these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope that the city has regained normalcy.
Some returned to fight the militants who distanced them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before Damascus arrived 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now."
"They say that the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to distance themselves for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children, as he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from working.
His neighbours from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the militia helped by the United States, allowed Al Qaeda to be driven out of the west of the capital, and invited him back.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his house north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm coming home today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have attracted the growing calm of the capital since the American troops arrived, and to the view of continuing formation of well-armed "groups of citizens involved" and collaborating with the American military to defend their neighbourhood.
But still others say they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three, expressed the suspicion felt by all about the exiled visas that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, who reportedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people are said to have fled the country because of the sectarian death squads.
"We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," said retiree Sunny.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house when I left."
The decrease in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis were driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
It is feared that a sudden influx of refugees will again increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Saar, good training.
The smallest federated state conducts vocational training, and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrians, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-derision, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland training system, which is placed fifth in the training instructor at the Cologne Institute of German Economy.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies there by a double or even a triple degree.
This is reflected in the high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Saarland also leads the country's children to higher than average higher education schools - many of them without a Gymnasium diploma.
"In Saarland, we take advantage of the vocational training system", says Axel Plünnecke, an expert in training at IW.
More than one in five young people obtain their degree in a vocational school, so Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
Thus the possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
Given the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Education in Sarrois has forced the higher schools into a marketing campaign in engineering science.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government has introduced comparison tests throughout the federated state.
For children to start learning earlier, the last year of daycare is free of law - a model that in the meantime other federated states also copy.
Only future comparative studies can show whether students' performance is improving in a sustainable way.
In PISA studies in 2003, the number of students at risk decreased from 29 per cent to 20 per cent.
In total, however, the Saarland has not improved as much as other federated states.
Bavarians are doing better.
And despite the sarrois, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise we could gain points in this area.
For the neighbor's language is compulsory in high schools - even if the sarrois are not French.
Chávez sets watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon make tick-tac other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will have the chronometer up by half an hour in the South American country.
In the meantime, Chavez became a cartoon in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated, as a result of a new law, watches will be set at less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
Anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would have no relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I cannot, already only because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is hastening a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe allegedly "cracked in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Sunday Chávez.
In Spain too Chávez is in all mouths.
A new cell phone ringing is raging in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the internet.
It was pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was upset by the constant arrests of the left-wing populists and who told him to remain silent.
A fall in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, a real loss of wages threatens German employees this year, according to a prognosis.
Experts have cited a variety of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, in 2007 employees should expect a real decrease on their payroll from the previous year.
"The blame lies in the low wage growth, the increase in value added tax and rising food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research, in the newspaper "Bild".
There may also be new charges for unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the projected decline in unemployment insurance of 3.3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, in the words of the SPD politician.
On Tuesday, it was known that the explosion in food and hydrocarbon prices had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from year to year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere hostile to life, Venus resembles the Earth more than we thought so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind whirlwinds at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightnings on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has today provided proof of this - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: the lightnings on Venus burst at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of cyprin, lightnings would have made life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If life has been there, it must have been at a very old date in history," explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should be hardly any living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the infernal twin of the Earth, but she's still a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which so much resembles the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venusian research, since no probe had been on its way to exploring this planet since the 1990s.
According to the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" do not only highlight the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the commonalities with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than assumed at first sight.
Thus the researchers found, in addition to the wind whirlpools already known at the North Pole, a whirlwind of clouds at the South Pole, which turns even faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet described as an evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much more slowly on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly recalls the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets were formed under similar conditions.
Of the two, water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth as carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands an end to the quarrel between the parties over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs for the attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about Germany's appearance and calls for the grand coalition to close the dispute over the Dalai Lama's welcome.
"We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the welcome of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even though I have respect for differences between cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the criticisms that it would organise a new policy for China.
The German Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional policy of one China.
"China knows that too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the Dalai Lama's reception and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained in particular about the CDU's "front office policy" on foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama was welcomed to the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in German-Chinese relations.
Thus the Chinese government not only de-commanded the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to Spiegel, also froze the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of both countries.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao now demands German Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the Dalai Lama's welcome was a mistake.
China refused to allow European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official office, thus supporting Wen Jiabao's Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama's words and actions would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other present-day provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fighting with the police, shooting, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not break out in the streets by violence, the German Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades burning, brittlers shooting at the police with shotguns: after the serious riots of young people in France, the German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not form as much at home as it does at home and defuses itself in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "Neue Presse" published in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would manage to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federal states and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, this already shows its first successes."
But it would be too early for an end to the alert.
Schäuble points out at the same time that in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems or from the point of view of urban planning as in France.
In northern Paris, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German government were demanded by the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasises that the unemployment quota for young people under 25 years of age from immigration would be above average.
Above all, more training places should be provided.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective".
The President of the Turkish communities added, however, that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration also don't want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat urged, "But we still have to be careful."
Young people should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training.
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburbs of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with searchlights.
The authorities in office reported three arrests, as well as a few burned cars and garbage.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the suburbs.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following night, the troubles overflowed in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
Angela Merkel's empire.
The chancellor's utopian entry shows that the coalition is done with the bottom - and there's nothing left to expect from her.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After his distressing speech in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here – not in the country which should, in the end, be governed by it.
The criticism of overly focusing on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel in a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said, and only showed that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it made it clear to all how accurate this criticism was.
There was neither any concrete interest nor feelings for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a weightless politician, who flees into foreign policy and who even there stays in the vicinity.
For example, climate protection: in this respect, it welcomes again and again the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate objectives will be achieved in our country.
Even self-praising - having so little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it two years ago.
Now it clings to formulas all made, that growth would affect people.
By this she destroys her image as a pragmatist, which solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He has a few additional sentences left for this.
In this respect, it is indicative of the number of times she makes lapsus when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three startups to pronounce a half-precise sentence.
It stuns in unknown terrain, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In Youtube's debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle - and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already breaking on the first subject.
He is said to have made New York a "shelter for illegal immigrants," criticises Mitt Romney for his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This one against him by heavy reproaches: "I would say that his own house was a haven for illegals," replied Giuliani and reproached the former governor of Massachusetts for having employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates mount the attack: as the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debates on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur films that Internet users sent via Youtube are barely more than blowers.
"It was with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," said John McCain to his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also taught vigorously by Vietnam veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign in the meantime go beyond the war in Iraq and debates on torture can be seen in the reactions of the common room in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whether conservative values are praised or future tax increases are denied, applause is heard in the auditorium.
This is where again the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
"I made a mistake at that time," explains Romney contrit and apologizes to the base and the television audience for having once again been a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, passes through a node when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in plainclothes.
One day after his withdrawal as head of the armies, Pakistani powerman Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of army domination end.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was appointed on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony at the Presidential Palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the Nation.
On Wednesday he had passed on his position as chief of the armies to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and had thus bent on international pressure, particularly that of the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power by a putsch without bloodshed, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By the withdrawal of the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on 3 November.
Already shortly after his inauguration Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another demand of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers from its ranks, had last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal area of northern Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on a street near the border with Afghanistan.
The Krautrock fathers are coming back.
The supergroups of Germany of the seventies replay: the three members of the band Harmonia again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return appeared recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced in the evening poster.
Each one has his little box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, at 63, sits in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
He is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old and in possession of a laptop and guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes this is inadvertently added to a piece of traditional music.
It doesn't seem too disturbing to the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia plays again has assured a few months among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, of course, the name reasons in the collective memory of pop, but in no way in such a lasting way that this group misses so painfully for 32 years.
But why wouldn't German also have the right to celebrate its living legends of the seventies?
All the more so because what is termed "Krautrock" has always been more popular in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, the room was seen with German pop faces questioning.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the pan-Gyric praise, the astonishment had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the scene of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the unknown is the one and only.
The memory is thus already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during this period, the impact power that felt was much weaker than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly troubleshooted in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, who was at the time perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an ancient Weser farm, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Kommune I", where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the manner of Spitzweg.
So-called was in the trash a fanion of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many kept Harmony away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next album was called "De Luxe".
As serene and modest as music sounded, the band suffered material misery.
The harvest of dead wood was not used in search of oneself.
The CD "Live 1974" that just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, as someone thinks they remember.
Rother expressed at that time the wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and assured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has had more success than Harmony ever had.
We owe Griessem's Live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland set the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as a German contribution inherent in contemporary music.
Neu! had already been dug up on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
Harmony's physical resurrection takes place at the Maison des cultures du monde in Berlin.
Funded publicly, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of Krautrock's influence would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmony.
Brian Eno's sentence hovers in the room in the midst of singular sounds: "The only true music, you listen to the future".
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the room of the farm.
Projections of other black and white photographs of bazaar-wired tools are used to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvised.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and to the battery, to draw the instruments sounds unheard of thanks to the instruments with effects built yourself.
Today, electronic music resembles electronic music.
The three in large technical figurators.
Even the choir of the house will make no difference to this.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a nice time "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never been about rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in the music conservatories (Can), in the technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia also no longer gets irritated by it now.
But what is most self-evident will be carefully covered on the stage.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
This can hit someone's nerves (?) or allow fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Peace of Murder", two films once again address the Balkan War.
But both of them don't convince.
Either the projects are too much based on action and the exchange of senseless shots or, on the contrary, they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news is that war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is precisely there, in the most gloomy hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is found.
Finally, we had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because far too many nice and futile roles in women's sentimental films and far too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument for still watching "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the chaser (why should today's films be as long and confusing as collective agreements for locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a magnificent representation full of nods: deep down, his war reporter character Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a ruined monument at its decline, nevertheless kept visible remains of his former charm.
But despite this advantage, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Peace Murder", which also comes out this week, the endless sequel of failed films on the Balkan War.
The film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from the Kosovar free-thirsty, in which one of the two still quickly falls in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not presented for once as the only causes of all evils, this film as flat as a TV movie gets lost far too quickly in action and the exchange of senseless shots.
This remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, one can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why in the background there has never been a real good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who condition themselves to track the high war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, along with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go as a small team into the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply do not let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynical with a heart, as he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also give her a romantic adventure with a Bosniac who was subsequently murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, within the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, manages that NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have not succeeded in five years: catching the war criminal and leaving him for just revenge to the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Court of the Hague should be seized of crimes against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) not to conduct the hunt intensively enough due to secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the wicked are this time so similar that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compassing, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiring it is to be mean."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but which insinuate how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films about the Balkan War.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been any good films on South Africa before.
This is worth every time: when a star hangs out on a crisis home or on a minefield, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits aller Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyway, decades have always passed before Hollywood could make a good holocaust movie with "Schindler's List".
Some films still have to mature well - those that today are worth classical works about Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have in no way been unanimously celebrated in their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we also know today simply too much about the conflicts of the world, where each hecatomb arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And that delights writers with the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not being" or "Dictator" have actually become as good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps we need to have the sarcastic and distanced artistic look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It is only because certain things never change".
"Great cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be horrifiedly murdered and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust picks up the criticism for the cancellation of the Olympiads.
The mayor's setback with Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics came up against virulent criticisms in politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the waterfront Games.
But Von Beust calls for realism in assessing chances.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, the principal director of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, described a drop-out on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as much motivation in the city as the idea of the Olympiads.
"Without this objective, the political-sport momentum could not have been maintained to the same extent".
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find it a new starting point in the longer term, "which takes as its starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday at his previous statements, according to which Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until the year 2028.
"It's not Hamburg that decides to apply for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said Von Beust at WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the expected decision of the Sports Federation in early December, regarding Munich's bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us, that in the period we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance."
However the dream does not definitely belong to the past, said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
From this the impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidature would also be in contradiction with the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiades as "not a substitute" for the Hamburg Olympics.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first in the past weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor's SPD fraction criticized the Senate for not using this valuable time in housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of Little Grasbrook was denied by the Senate for years because it played the Olympiad card and excluded housing construction," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for the Petit Grasbrook to have a plan integrated into the Olympiads and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, for its part, would have raised great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had broken against Leipzig.
It's not Warhols' crates.
The one who connects the Swedish concepts with the wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol's list of works.
A large part of the ninety "Stockholm Type" Brillo-Boxes listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes, the internal research of the Stockholm Moderna Museet now leads to a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hulten Museum donated in 1995 to the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as much of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Stockholm Type", which circulate on the international art market.
Ancient history is entangled, a disconcerting sequence of artistic and curatoric productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York its first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the powder soap cartons "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo carton cases: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo carton factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden crates that at the time would have entered by right into the history of art and auction, as Andy Warhol's original Brillo-Boxes authorized, with the name "Stockholm Type".
Some of them have reached over $100,000 in auction sales.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén museum mistakenly claimed that later about a hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then have ceded to him.
Indeed, Hultén's 105 cases were produced in Malmö in 1990 only, for an exhibition in St Petersburg.
By that time Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, next to the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three more of Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and sanded, and then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The texture of the copies that date back to 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the paint was applied directly without a background layer on the laminated panels, using a paint roller - moreover, it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic.
"These crates were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol's official list of Brillo-Boxes," suggests Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six crates in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
Already in July the Authentication Board of course announced that it would investigate the "heavy charges" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since then, we've had an inexorable silence.
Manila Rebel Soldiers Abandon
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers abandon, the same who had cut themselves off in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
The soldiers loyal to power had shortly before stormed the hotel using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had cut themselves off for hours in the building.
About half of them were held in court on Wednesday due to a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclipse himself with about 30 sympathizers.
Military police officers, who normally had to watch them, had apparently deserted in his favor and had joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The troops loyal to the government closed the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have had enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us".
General Danilo Lim, who commanded before the Scout Ranger elite unit, said other army units soon wanted to join the march.
Critics of the regime had called for a major protest against the President on Wednesday.
His government had been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
Since 2003, Manila's finance district has been the scene of the attempted mutiny of some 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
The insurgency broke almost 24 hours after the army refused to join it.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a main shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet secured a stake of more than 20 percent in the Versatel telecommunications company.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as reported by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 percent of the equity would be held.
We had previously speculated about a buyback.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step we seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, communicated United Internet.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institute would hold the money only for a third part, it is said on the market.
The previous day, United Internet had already acquired a stake of nearly 10 percent in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million on the stock exchange.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephony.
"We're strengthening our partnership," said a United Internet spokesperson.
Both companies founded the MSP equity company to absorb the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, both companies want to estimate themselves satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not make use of their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent at Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
The two companies would, however, allow themselves all the options open, especially to increase the stake in SA Freenet, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
Poker still difficult to predict on Freenet which has lasted for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers bound by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The Holding of United Internet and Drillisch had a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01 percent to date.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch would bring about an additional four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
