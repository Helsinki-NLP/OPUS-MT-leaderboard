What's going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new elected CSSD officials at the capital city hall will apparently have to overcome a real linguistic barrier to understand each other at the municipal council level with their former and new SDO colleagues.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the CSSD-owned city council, whether they know the argot that was born in the last few years at the town hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition who were leading in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political cream set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was with surprise that it was discovered that the new elected officials did not understand the known terms very well.
At least they say so.
"Who's Valdemort".
"I really don't know."
"I am a young man in Prague politics reacted Lukas Kaucky, the chosen one to culture to the "sponsor" vocabulary test".
And as far as the political veteran is concerned, elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
"It's the only expression among the ones you offer me I use"
Otherwise, I don't use the slang.
From the vocabulary, of which the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-electoral congress of the SDO, the editorial staff has chosen 6 examples, in priority those that are linked with the town hall of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the patisserie", "oxen nerve", "trahison of the capital" and "enter".
Three of the elected officials agreed on the quiz, the fourth- Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek outright refused the test.
"I don't care at all about these things and how the representatives of citizen democracy have fun: I won't give my opinion."
"I'm currently dealing with how we're going to understand each other in our programs," he responded.
As has already been heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the above legend, that this is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former Mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka Tunnel," Kaucky said and immediately adds: "But I know it from the newspapers".
"I'm gonna have to buy myself a language course," he jokes.
Not only the Matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the chosen for the environment, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of the meaning of "go to the pastry".
"It's, I think, about going to a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it's the head office of the Janousek companies.
In the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests there is no argot lexicon in social democracy.
"I've taken advice with colleagues and it seems we really don't have anything of this kind".
"We think of names sometimes we use abbreviations and symbols," says Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, whom the members of the Party call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," admits Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily Actual.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for the members of the Party or the least friendly Little old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by the scams during the party sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little joujou".
The nicknames are also the only ones that the Social Democrats admit to use within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda much, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this Pragois president.
"Doctor of Baton Law" reportedly recalls that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title of Doctor of Law JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches", published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
Rather, they are part of the old generation, cannot work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man very rarely has this fate".
"You don't judge young healthy women either because they participate in work and give birth to children," says a sister who works in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special facility of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He edited a brochure that should help limit witch hunting.
There's a "hic" in the case.
"More than 70 per cent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the daily Die Standard warned about the disadvantage of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil that they had sprinkled on her.
This information was transmitted by the BBC server.
Criminals claim it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointings was flamed in contact with the woman.
The oil flamed, it seems, when the team wanted to "hunt the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people at all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human spirit eaters have always been a danger," he says.
As Burkina Faso strives to reduce witch hunting, the Gambia has even seen the President himself participate in it no later than last year.
"Gambian President Dzammi, after his aunt's death, launched a large witch hunt that, it seems, would have participated in his death and would have endeavored by the black magic to also kill the President."
"Closed Guinean shamans came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal custody of the President, randomly chosen men and women in villages in Gambia," said in a message the organization "Amnesty International.
At the farm the imprisoned people had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects which in addition caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
About a thousand people were released from international pressure.
The tenant of Bakal: The stoves are heating, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man came out through the door of the RPG Byty customer center of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new leases for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and his son who is serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 apartment of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works with solid fuel," point out on his son's new contract the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed anyway," he explained, angry and half resigned.
The citizens' association of BytyOKD.cz apartments which has described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But the man reacts to this by a gesture of the hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" by frowning.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory for deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not match the market price.
For this reason Aktualne.cz decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska Street is one of the four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Right next door stands a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "2011 rent", is lit on the touch screen.
Only one pressure and one paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number is already starting to light up on the large screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it's your turn.
After a short while, an old couple arrives to find out about the rent, but the new rents don't seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems like everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving mail with new leases in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special window for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still on trial," replied, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The deragulation and the old apartments of minors of Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of parliament and from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported this in a fairly sustained way before the elections and it now fills the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor".
"They didn't even change me a board put...n in the toilet, relieves in introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to make sure that they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they sign now as promised RPG in a special offer.
This is a rebate of half of the rent to be paid to other landlords who have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by the questions.
"Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," says the employee at the counter.
And yet RPG posts individual interviews on rents when necessary, both on its website and in showcases.
If both parties do not agree on the rent, the decision will be made by an independent tribunal.
'It's not about threats, it's only about informing about the unique and legitimate way to act legally," says RPG on its website.
"Here no one will go to court" thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man in the street in front of the customer center is right.
"I have 13,000 retirement crowns and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore the people wait," she says.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the rent increase.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rents to invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hung from the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs of the waiting room of Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments".
"And it will always be at most 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," says the screen.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, it is an increase of a really low sum 19.66 Czech crowns per square metre," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money for the increase in rents (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement have priority.
The nursery school is also part of the offices have included architects.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini nursery school with everything you need - color walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, children of Arch. design employees can go there.
The architectural-project company Arch. Design. whose workshops produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini nursery school of enterprise since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially of the age, to make children, and it was important for women architects and project managers to be able to return to work quickly.
At the same time as reduced-time employment contracts, the nursery school is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work that takes care of children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who imagined this nursery school and with the support of the management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini nursery school is financed by the European Social Fund through the Human Resources Operational Programme and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding (to the tune of 2.8 thousand Czech kroner), they were able to purchase equipment and appliances and after two years provide qualified personnel and start-up.
After the use of the funding endowment (two years) the Arch. Design. company has the obligation after 3 years to run the mini nursery school from its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and Economy rating helped to apply for funding.
Children are cared for by qualified staff, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of the children all day long. Children can go to nursery school without any age limit, but they are more than three years old for the most part.
As it is a "mini nursery school" there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more that replace each other.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it takes on individual care and education, the programme of the mini nursery school is comparable to that of pre-school education.
Children do not just play there, but quality education is also provided - from the beginning to school preparation English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and not be under the stress of being late to pick up children at a school away from the parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is no surprise that a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer is being created.
Arch.Design.is thus registered among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and that are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens the marketing of HR.
The bone house fascinates again after 100 years. Take a look in Gaudi's interiors.
The toit resembles the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase to a dinosaur spine and balconies to open fish mouths.
Thus is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona of architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house was given the nickname "Bold House" by the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is ypic for the Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaudi.
The front façade of the house unfolds its dream lines, pleasant colors and textures that recall nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see geometry, rhythm and thought order with precision.
In the night the façade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies in waves the window frames, balustrades, decorative elements of the doors, the oeilleton and the slats.
The Battlo house which stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at number. 43, was born from the construction of a house in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of another brand new but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual reconstruction and cheaper.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-dwelling house was not conceived by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations were born for a representation apartment of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade.
For the facade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for the plans of Casa Battlo began with successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi Casa Mila's house and Guell Park in which there are other Gaudi's works.
Locals dubbed the hot house just after its finish because of its organic forms "the Bone House".
Others, with regard to the specific window opening mechanism, have called it "the house that yawns".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of St.George the patron of Catalonia.
Other elements of construction sculpture contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with typical vents and fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination seems odd.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not respect the construction directives of then and did not allow himself to be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the building permit, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the finishing the city council was horrified and asked for modifications.
Members of the city council, for example, were not pleased that the pillars of construction were encroaching on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the city's call Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) for permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and in the third there was a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which one accesses to an independent toit terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the salons and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction received besides new facades a non-traditional frame and two additional floors.
Gaudi's play with light is also impressive, blue and white glazed tiles with which is decorated the inner courtyard and with the skylights.
The two-colour game gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that the white reflects more than the dark that on the contrary absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house which was listed in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits as they found it to be a lucrative business and extended the scope of the visits to common areas and the attic including the toit terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discounts.
The sum is still above Gaudi's entry price into the other buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the residents of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a bed base: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the area reserved for the bed, so the mattress and base give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive: the weight, the height, the age, the state of health as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and base are placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where latex mattresses are not continuously sleeping are not appropriate because they "warm up" slowly.
In addition, they have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
They need to be returned frequently.
If they do not also have enough ventilation channels in the heart, and if they also remain on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mould can also form there.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
Anyone who spends the clearest time abroad where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a softening layer, will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all the hobeyists coming back from NHL complain they can't sleep there".
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam".
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder which therefore poorly assume "information" of the joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hobeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything works well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses for example.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to be able to enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won't turn around in the night like after a tough game.
You're just sleeping better.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against the esquarres.
For the choice of mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220cm.
The minimum width for each for a two-seater bed should be 90 cm or a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, singles, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should lay hands comfortably with the elbows slightly folded. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Mattress-Buttermakers and decorators who has been dedicated for several years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and teaches it in specialized schools.
For a two-seater bed each needs its own bed base and mattress, so be careful however during the shopping to choose the height of the mattress well.
Otherwise you will only have to climb the base at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which count for the layer of shape and ventilation at least three centimeters.
"In the touch or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Hélena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-defined type of base.
The bed-spring, when the mattress and the bed-spring are united like Siamoese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; it should not be washed, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night one normally sweats from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and clogged) sieve.
For this purpose, specialists refuse to make a claim over a 25-year lifetime for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But it's all hers.
And for this an experienced advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the coating of the mattress, hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to manufacture coatings with zipper for the whole set, that is to say that after opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) otherwise handling for the big models (and for one person only) becomes when we remove them a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a bed base?
Never!
Maximum for a bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are none) with ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with sachet springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an aeration layer.
A polyurethane mattress shall not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-positioned slats with 14/18 slats, latex or sandwich mattresses (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are doubled in the lower part of the kidneys and thus it is possible to regulate the rigidity of the slats.
For multi-position mattresses, spring mattresses should not be taken because they do not respond to changes in position.
Next to the adjustment of the rigidity of the slats one can also install what is called a shoulder cradle.
This is a special connection of the slats that allows to press or even tilt the slat so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have "shoulders as wide as their backs," this is really an important thing.
This thing is already being considered by mattress manufacturers who for "masculine" have begun to use a softening area at the shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are winged or padded summers with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure spreads in more points and diinches the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and swollen with air) on good mattresses and base, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians prefer by example.
When lying on the side, the pillow must level (with the shoulder cradle of the base or the area softened in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first straw and grass-based mattresses.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also for organic mattresses.
The petrole-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soya oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"The Bio label for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop perfumes of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of birch plants so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
The red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weak sex.
The current favourites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cellular structure so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know precisely where the head, lower back and feet are located.
You will pay for a quality mattress from 7,000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached first place.
Saving for the mattress and the base is not simple.
From time to time, two mattresses for the price of a single mattress may be used as part of special actions by manufacturers or producers.
For example, Magniflex offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
We can obviously take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with Tempur matter at a "cosmical" rhythm.
This began as a matter for NASA because astronauts were undergoing huge load factors at the start.
The Tempur softens with heat and hardens, on the contrary, with cold.
It adapts perfectly to the hot human body and distributes an optimal pressure.
For this it is ideal against sleeping sickness and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special cushions for feet that relieves legs and the venous system.
Czech manufacturers use e.g. EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or of the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly required by parents who want to look after their children.
Fear for their child causes more and more people to think about watching them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can just as well be used to trace the movement of people and help in some cases as for example that of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a matchbox but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved a large number of people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disrupt their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not espionage but only another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracing devices on the Czech market.
"I confess that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases".
"The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons," adds Pilin.
According to him, children should always know for what purpose "the box" is used and how to use it in an emergency.
The children's psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to focus on him something of this type, he will get rid of it.
'And even the smaller ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something on purpose when they don't want to be under control'.
"Mobile phones, which can be cut off like these tracking devices, have already led parents to long expectations," says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of an attack is very questionable.
"If this is a prepared abduction, the author will do everything he can to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him".
"Currently, it's the phone".
"As soon as tracing devices develop, they (the criminals) will also seek them out because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign".
"In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
She admits, however, that such devices can help in an assault not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracing services for both cars and people, it says that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an assault.
"The device may be configured in such a way that it is in regular emission after a specified period of time".
"If the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned".
"The more expensive devices also have a tiltometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and ends up lying down without moving," says Cech.
According to him the so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after formatting it with a special pretext.
The problem with current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn in pendants the size of a match box or the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being conducted to make devices that resemble common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential attacker will not be able to recognize the tracing device".
"Or he'll find out after a while, which will give the police a little more time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as for tracing cars.
This is a combination of GPS position acquisition systems (which is commonly used in auto-nautization) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating ropes that it could go around the Czech Republic with it, but it can only last two years.
The army bought for 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had bought 224 km of them.
So the army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the ropes is up to two to four years.
The army bought detonating ropes from the public limited company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as reason for the stumbling block of a huge amount of detonating ropes to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be made by army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with command, secretaries or household staff should have an explosive drill every year.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating ropes.
At this distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the army's reserves could support it for 10 years.
If on the contrary it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is sufficient to more than 2 m of detonating ropes, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase ensured - also with the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
We're not talking about the lack of body linen.
"And I don't mind if they buy so much detonating ropes from us."
"And that's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"For us the army is a good customer that we strive as traders to satisfy," says STV Group sales manager Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argued that hundreds of kilometres of detonating ropes would be lost by the fact that the army would have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reports only four years of life of the detonating ropes and the police and army pyrotechnicians of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can go even up to four years," says one who does not want his name to be published in view of the army's criticism.
The past life span, each munition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the soldier's life.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating ropes.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," says spokesman Pejsek, who interprets the advice of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating lines by police pyrotechnicians who neutralize Second World War ammunition or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their lifetime.
This has been established for safety reasons of pyrotechnicians and to be able to obtain more modern and reliable types of detonating ropes in a more flexible way.
The Ministry of Defence today has big problems for the neutralisation of dozens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army strong of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading on the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating ropes that it now buys "at cheap prices".
Until now, I have benefited from the contacts I have obtained through the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the Best Individual Entrepreneur competition.
The winner of last year's Best Individual Entrepreneur competition was 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukas Pytloun.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Libérec there was a lack of a quality hosting site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still studying in the trossème year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our area made me want to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building that he turned into a boarding house with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has enabled him to open in Libérec 4 pensions, two restaurants of style and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year another of the same quality came to him.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other Pytloun hotel franchise candidates showed up," the number one entrepreneur last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the winner at the Entrepreneur of the Year competition served well," adds Pytloun with gratitude.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he's still using his contacts and knowledge that he couldn't have obtained in any other way.
"With those I met through the contest I began to maintain trade relations regularly.
According to him, fame related to success also had an impact on employees.
And he's got about 70.
"I especially observe in them the loyalty and pride of having engaged in something that has been generally recognized".
"This is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to collect the prize in Slovakiansky dum for the first place in the competition for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the Farmet company.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
'I can say that the award not only encouraged my colleagues and increased our self-confidence to fight competition,' said the winner of last year's competition today.
At the beginning of the history of the Farmet company there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not very long after they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After 18 years it has become the largest automatic press manufacturer in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the successful completion of the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers really get to know the Farmet brand better but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were collaborating with a company that got the greatest success in its country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But last year did not happen at Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's valuation was based on the economic results for 2008 and in part for 2009.
And precisely in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We obviously did not escape this situation".
"The turnover fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must be aware that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and retained beneficial results even though they were inferior to those they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued uncompromisingly to invest in research and development.
"We have built with the endowments a training and research center, strengthened the company's presentation in international exhibitions-exhibitions and won the main awards in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything leaves us to think that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of cases go up and with them the number of employees also.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that suppresses senseless regulations.
The Absurdity of the Year investigation is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be removed.
The little glorious winner of this year's investigation into the absurdity of the year was the obligation to bring to the offices documents that officials can obtain online.
More than one third of the 4,000 voters voted for this.
For example, the social affairs authorities asked for a paper extract from the business register, while the official can obtain it in two clicks.
It changes because of the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer ask for the extract from the Trade Register for control of insurance payments," said Jana Buranova, spokesperson for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Bringing out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs have to fill in in the Czech Republic and removing those that are absurd is the meaning of this year's absurdity contest.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
Last year, 3000 voters came forward, and at least 4000 this year brought their votes.
And it's no wonder, there are in our country the most various legal obligations that only slow down the company, and, this, more and more.
"We may be the number of documents to fill out for tax returns at the top places in the world," says Karel Havilik of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a stated goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared with the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is in 74th place in terms of conditions for the company, an increase of 8 places compared to last year.
The "Absurdity of the Year" competition was first launched in 2006 and continues each year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic absurdities every year from April to the end of September, the final deadline before the competition closes.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest selects seven candidates for "the anti-price" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received the largest number of votes is declared the winner.
Until last year's last investigation, it was a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that lost their sense of existence.
Comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore among the nominees is for example the obligation that maintenance vehicles for motorways and expressways pay tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the contest, which always begins in early November at Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the highlight of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts astonishment in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my objective is to delete, each year, at least three dozen paragraphs which today only complicate the business', said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd decrets is not a sword stroke in the water.
In 2007, what did not appeal to people was the requirement for contractors to report three days before at the office for the individual business at the location of the business, the intention to go to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the addition of the Single Business Act.
The second most widely accepted requirement in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a 30-day tour of duty for a foreign employee, was removed with the so-called Green Card Act.
And everything's okay until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decrement for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their practice, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the Year 2010.
The onjective of this competition is support for the reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that monitor their company's environmental impacts and conduct a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, which is the guarantor and promoter of this contest, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this sub-category of the competition of the company of the year 2010, organized by the company Vodaphone, registered companies that have not succeeded with a single long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each of them is full of inspiration and an independent article would be to be published.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their support activity and forecasting can be regarded as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic is no example of the Pragian prological society Et Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors children with disabilities for the past 17 years.
The old paper-making plant in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of its workforce, has been awarded the title of Head for the Central Bohemia Region and placed third in the region at the competition of the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it was MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who won for having introduced flexible working hours and even decreased up to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionately, a reduction in wages.
The jury also awarded her the title because she bought first of all from Czech manufacturers, supported a ditoyan activity in the nearby environment and was concerned about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the company's executive director.
the company responsible IT Enlogit of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has put in place for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the Man in the Shadow Foundation that helps the local Roma community," says Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
At the very last rank is, also for its activities, a company of washing and cleaning of the Karlovy Vary area, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, skills increase and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the Bruntal construction company Czasch, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition were automatically enrolled in the responsible company category, who had responded to the questionnaires as an attachment to the registration document and had referred it to the organizer before August 15.
The poorly completed or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in competition had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the firm Responsible but were not disqualified from the competition "principal" the Firm of the Year of Vodaphone".
"Independent registration is not possible because it is a sub-category of the main competition of the Firm of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public contest
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed the local entrepreneur and shopkeeper in Lubos real estate.
The latter had endeavoured to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a request for restitution in such a way that the land proposed was obtained by a particular candidate.
This one was supposed to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider trading in a public tender and competition," said Plzen prosecutor Antonie Zelena's newspaper Pravo, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is under way.
The police released this 46-year-old contractor after 24 hours.
To know how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate with regard to so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, the spokesperson for the Fonds des Terrains Lubomira Cerna said that the police had actually arrested in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a client and in no way an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land according to the Land Act" and is put in place when several eligible candidates manifest themselves.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to resituations which must be paid before the value of the land is announced".
"According to the proposed rights a ranking of the purchasers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights", explained the spokesperson of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information concerning the persons who had registered for the appeal and, as he himself is, also a beneficiary because having bought a large number of rights to restitution, he had offered the candidates to the field not to participate in the competition.
And he probably cashed in by withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts largely above the standards at the FdT (Fonds des Terrains).
He appeared in the case of former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted in criminal proceedings for editing land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been edited.
For example, Lubos G. had obtained land for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the access artery to the Borske Pole industrial zone was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was obliged to accept because otherwise it risked endangering the construction by blocking the land.
Households will pay a supplement of about a hundred crowns monthly for housing.
Households will have to pay a supplement from January onwards not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
Families will therefore have to draw from their wallets from January onwards up to a hundred crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to one tenth more for water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be close to 100 more crowns per year for households in flats than at present.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices given the significant development in encouraging the manufacture of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
So there are also about a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in central heating prices differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 more crowns per month, families in Libérec will pay more than 1,000 crowns annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague an increase of 9 per cent for water and sanitation in case the city increases the infrastructure rents.
If rents do not change the Pragois will pay a surcharge of 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest compared to the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are increasing by 7.4 percent.
Rent prices will rise significantly, for example, in the 450 thousand apartments rented from January onwards, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example the company CPI Byty which owns in Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments, has decided an increase up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by the company.
The regulated rents that people pay in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk with rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts very gently.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in hospital for re-offending are no exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to the admissions of children's departments in hospitals.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk".
'The trend is really strong alcohol," says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department of Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to pick up a bottle of daddy's in the closet, it's sometimes about wisky but it's the fernet and vodka that prevail."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so don't feel it," explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokeswoman for Motol Hospital, is also right.
"In general, it's rum or fernet".
"It's now fashionable alcohol especially in elementary schools".
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought back from the house," added Jurinova.
According to the Head of Department Pélikan, seeing drunk children between the ages of 13 and 14 in hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he practiced ten years precisely in paediatrics where ambulances brought school children from the wide, completely drunk surroundings.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times
"She started her career at twelve when she was brought in with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with in addition a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party".
"What's interesting is that it didn't seem weird to the mother that her daughter was away for 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the parents' disinterestedness or their extraordinary tolerance for the fact that their offspring drink which is the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to experts, however, there is no mention of dependence, in its strict sense, on children.
"Under the term alcoholic one hears a chronic addiction to alcohol of several years with all the phenomena which result from it but which one does not find in children".
"In those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is rather a socio-familial background that is significantly unfavourable," explained the Head of Department Pelikan.
According to spokesperson Jurinova, about forty drunken children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with a grâve intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Intoxicated children who are after emergency care brought home by parents or police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pelikan, it exites three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of witches, Saint Sylvester and the end of the school year.
"Be they drink out of spite after bad results either on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holiday".
"Of course I lived on witch's day an admission of seven drunken children at once," stressed Pelikan.
The drunk child who spent the night in the hospital in rehab under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffered the day after the "wood guule".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better off because they have an excellent evening and then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them".
"They are only surprised where they are," adds Pelikan, knowing that from time to time this spoils the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and intensive care bed hospitalization can range up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I have applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their drunkenness has cost and that they could spend the whole summer on seasonal work to pay back a single evening," added Pelikan.
However, in his view, health insurance companies in their declining management, which should recover the costs of care from parents, do not deal with cases of drunken children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, for which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off on Tuesday for Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
This is the first time that such aircraft have become the property of anyone other than the Czech Army.
However, they have been abroad in exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that were up to now in service in the Czech Army and were in flight condition.
The remaining three devices are single-seater versions of the L-159.
These are currently stationed at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of Vodochody's aircraft is currently unknown.
"The L-159 single-seater aircraft planned for exchange have been taken from long-storage aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence".
"The L-159 T1 dual-seaters were traded in the state," said for Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seaters since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 single-seaters into two-seaters.
The Army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second aircraft scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
"In the contract it is clearly stated that whoever takes the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used for training pilots from NATO member countries".
"It is therefore the case of the one who takes into account to determine how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was endorsed last year by Mirek Topomanek's government.
The Ministry of Defence did not tender and contacted EADS directly.
Defence management argued that the exchange would ensure a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and uses only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will probably have legal implications.
the European Commission has nevertheless filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because the planes should have been chosen in the framework of a European-wide tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the ring finger is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men with longer indexes than ring finger are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men under the age of 60," declared the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Great Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the right hand index shorter than the ring finger.
For them, as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those with the longer index than the annular, however, the risk fell to 33 per cent, and for men before age 60, the risk decreased to 87 per cent.
The length ratio of the two mentioned fingers - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, among other things, different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely testosterone that helps to develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said for TKC that he is aware of this study but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
The Czech Republic like most of Europe is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On roads and sidewalks, there is mostly compact snow, the clearingmen have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometers towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 road in Brno towards Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the news
In the 91st kilometre a truck was crashed, in the 93rd two heavy goods vehicles struck, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars were also found in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 km towards Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should exit just after Brno at 190 km or go through Brno and then enter at 182 km to Kyvalka.
A line of cars several kilometers long formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and this, just upon arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, car queues are created in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also blocked.
The safest means of transportation is the subway.
Trams are delayed, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff still has to meet.
There are also problems with the railways and the airport.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove 7 rapid links due to snow.
Lines from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun, for example, have problems.
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11:00 a.m. in the night until 5:00 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but with increased vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impassable, on the road to Brno there begins to be snow gusts in places and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass some communication routes in the places above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected areas.
So far the axes are closed: Rusinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, it may be necessary to send snow and snow strawberries.
We can't yet estimate when they'll be rollable.
On the road to Hodonin caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
On roads that are, with regard to nature protection, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimetres of snow warns TKC.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two and 10 centimetres of snow; it fell the most in northern Bohemia, often with up to 18 centimetres of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell up to 15 centimetres of snow.
Snow is gradually disappearing in the Czech Republic.
The Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army sent a new "intelligent" weapon to Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25 code.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super-precise cannon.
Its projectiles are guided by laser with an accuracy of a few meters.
The 25 mm calibre special ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly breaking explosive, actually works like small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is also not protected from above and when it falls on a deadly rain of shards of steel, it can put it out of combat as well.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus getting a precise target point, according to which he corrects his target site and presses the trigger.
"Let's say you shot at 543 meters".
"When you press the trigger, the weapon loads and shoots at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters," said Audette.
400 offshore jobs
Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will be moving their workplaces to Astro Park, which is currently located at the Mareinbader Square office building in the Bad Homburg area.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer manufacturing and maintenance giant said on Wednesday, next year in July, the 400 men and women's workplace, located so far on the Marienbader Square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on the rue Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokesman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group should bring together another 100 jobs still scattered so far in the region.
The offer of rental has been extremely attractive. Moreover, the offices with open area of Astro Park are better suited to the way of work of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
The Managing Director, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is for us a prime location with a remarkable infrastructure".
He claims that the connection to the airport is of great importance to a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company inside the region yesterday sparked the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the Frankfurt municipality, Mr Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again a "global actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its location is an important impetus for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
Management informed the municipality of this intention very soon.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our assistance to this company," said Mr Korwisi.
However, friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer vis-à-vis the owner of the Marienbader Place building.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of preventing such an exceptional place from remaining unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville building, used so far by the Fujitsu company and the nearby "small vertical" as well as the rest of the Place Marienbad buildings, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
As a result of a joint project between the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the railway station and the Town Hall, which attracted many criticism, not only because of the impressive layout of the areas that used to be partly parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment consulting company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German group of Frankfurt specialized Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group headquartered in Tokyo is considered to be the third largest supplier of IT products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronics and Electrotechnical Industry.
Amazon Deportation of the Server - Threats to Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing increasing difficulties.
The Amazon Internet service provider expelled the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents from its servers.
This attitude may hide political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
Wikileaks founder, Mr. Assange, apparently lives in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with ever greater force.
The group of cyber activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the prominent U.S. Senator, Joe Lieberman, called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably staying in Britain, according to news reports published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom", said on Wednesday (local time) cyber-activists behind the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber-business, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists used Amazon's Web Service (AWS) to reach the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem for Amazon, "they should stop selling books".
CNN television channel, citing Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation conducted by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The chairman of the Senate Commission for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier with regard to previous Wikileaks publications of classified information," the senator said.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks are acting illegally, monstrously and unscrupulously, putting our national security at risk and jeopardizing life around the world," according to an independent senator's statement.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the content of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr.Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of people wanted by Interpol.
According to information from the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described Swedish prosecutions against him as intrigues orchestrated by his critics.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson told London that threats were made against the site.
"Calls have even been made for Julian Assange's murder."
That's why Assange fears especially for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
That's also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was clearly responding to the statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that those responsible for Wikileaks' revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Head of Government Advisor Stephen Harper told television, obviously ironically, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a drone."
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for U.S. President Barack Obama, described as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr. Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in spying activities.
"I don't know exactly why we need to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the assertions of a website."
The U.S. government is now completely testing the protection of its databases.
According to a White House statement, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Anti-Terrorism Centre, was appointed responsible for combating leaks.
Mr Travers is responsible for putting in place "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that it wanted to deal with the security of dissidents and activists if they were ever threatened by Wikileaks revelations.
"We've made every effort to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day induction course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where's all the ice coming from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German the somewhat old-fashioned ice confectioner, manufactures cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making art.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatula, puts it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice, cannot avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The sherbet maker founded the Ice University in 2003 to ensure that ice creams out of its machines meet high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from around the world.
Special courses are also offered on chocolate ice for several days, as are practical sessions in private ice cream shops.
In the middle of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others risk simply fulfilling their burning desire on smooth ice.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of artistic education from California, is a fan of the Slow Food movement. He wants to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial ice.
Anke de Berlin is an advisor in business management and after a few years she wants to draw something unique from this challenging job for nerves.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice-cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian maid came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master Luciano Ferrari glacier first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
Is decisive not only the good flavor, but also the silky flexibility and the good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation the cherries on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, from the south: "Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still retains a hell of a dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats everything to 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
It then opens a faucet installed on the machine: a white, pasteurized base cream, which forms the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately assailed with the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can one give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr Luciano warned against being misled by the spirit of time.
Those who speak only of ice cream "made from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers, for example, guar seed flour obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will eat nothing but ice pellets.
Some changes to the basic mass are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with aromas.
Master Luciano makes the difference between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit or confectionery department of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to give you dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in fruit sorbets recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it, becomes a yellow cream and, when added cocoa powder, constitutes the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must move on to the use of ice machines.
Luciano occasionally invites them to make four kinds of ice creams: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice creams are also subject to the same experience.
No more aromatic substances, no more fruit purées: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice does not necessarily have the taste of the nut, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
Kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a well-balanced mixture correctly raises the taste of an ice cream," says Luciano.
Ice making is a calculation exercise: if you use peach puree with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the winemakers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as in the past, so much physical intervention.
It is not only the machine for the automatic manufacture of the basic mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the available ice mix is simultaneously beaten to make it smooth and reduced to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automations, slight breakdowns are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo dazzles himself with fruit purée from head to toe and, thus, splashes his fellow students when control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that an "incident like this is likely to occur in each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has formed the nucleus of the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the Testbiotech Expert Group, which is considered an independent institute for assessing the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we're well informed," Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, told Munich on Wednesday.
There is some information that the Chairman of the Efsa Expert Group on Genetically Modified Plants, Mr Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi pressure group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in developing the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The requirements drawn up correspond verbatim, by sub-paragraphs, to the position taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the mark of the industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities located in Parma in Italy.
This is already the second time Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior Efsa official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period. In doing so, she changed sides.
Not long ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the EU supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicions from both the German Federal Agency for the Environment and MEPs.
However, the Efsa does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
There is an opinion that all reliable data, including industry data, are being used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Efsa are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the United States-based International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI).
This organization sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together experts from science, industry and policy, among others, to assess the risks of biotechnology without being on the payroll of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feed testing in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the impact of genetically modified maize causes in the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If we don't look for risks, how can we then discover them?" asked Mr. Then in an accusative tone.
That is also Mrs Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been conducting research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic.
In this region, as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
For this reason, there are hardly any researchers who are not related to societies.
In the view of companies, critical studies would not be published.
Hilbeck says "industry controls safety research".
The stone trail
Uli Gsell obtained it, in total about 400 kilos.
Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: By September, excavators had come and begun to demolish much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people protested against the S21 project, the transformation of the Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost several billions.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations resulted in the stoppage of construction work.
Broken into 6000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muskelkalk (shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a tender and coarse pavement badly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor residing in Ostfildern.
He got a few fragments of it.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically states: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He claimed that by cutting it at the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he'll do with this fragment yet.
Rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
traces of Stuttgart stones lead to a former French army ammunition depot in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappeared in the dump," he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He says he was insulted and threatened when in September newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for whole days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to keep using the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project later took one of the stone parallelepipepede weighing on average 80 kilos with a value between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a memory in while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half is still piled up in the forest, the rest having long been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came from all over and took away everything that could enter the trunk and trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or into limitations of grass plates.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"was not this political component."
He enters his all-terrain car, walks around his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He studied law and later began studying biology before becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a carrier.
And a rock lover.
It stores 40,000 tons.
It gathers treasures all over Germany.
He claims that he is the largest merchant of ancient stones.
He's repressing himself.
Artfully carved sandstones are laid on the snow.
"Otherwise, They Were Part of the Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden".
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he said with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
It shows a heap of the finger: Red sandstone, previously, part of Karlsruhe railway station.
And so on.
"Joli travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the grandstand of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Throughout the snow of stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from the St Blasian cathedral, the tuff from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thought that the stones were once hand carved and moved with simple hoists and carts pulled by oxen, he became quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were torn apart."
He didn't get rich, let alone rich.
But this carrier now employs 14 people. In addition, stone tailors, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
"We're working hard, but it's rewarding," says the waste recycler.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are stones to save, too.
Fighting talent to conquer high potentials
There's a lot of traffic in the counter.
16 students rushed to buy salmon rolls, tomato sauce and white-eating.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the Volkswagen car manufacturer invited design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
As part of a kind of competition of ideas, they have to talk business about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen firm.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body to body in the competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most gifted graduates as far as possible in the amphitheatre before they enter the labour market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify exceptional talents in the context of practical projects and to retain them.
On the second day of the workshop held at the Technical University of Brauschweig the automotive group amasses talent.
A young lady in the staff department shares pens, candy and cards featuring Volkswagen's logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs for young talent; she shows them the ways to access the group's premises.
Nico Selle of the Braunschweig Technical University is responsible for the project started with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, it can know the students, look more closely at serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play as collaborators."
According to Mr. saddle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive we're trying to attract students with.
"In the past, the focus was on the professional project," says Mr. Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much harder.
In many sectors, companies are no longer able to recruit their employees by sorting out a number of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and above all woo the highly skilled workforce.
It is mainly Engineering graduates who find themselves in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineering association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the gap in engineering positions will grow further.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, an audit, accounting and consulting firm.
It organizes expensive events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a sort of rally-paper where competitors have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the United States in this way.
Participants can also visit KPMG's subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The person who must participate in the selection shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to seek high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little."
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the count seems to be there.
"Until today, we have kept in touch with all those who took part last year in a similar action."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their requests to our company soon," he says.
Apart from the direct pooling at the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are doing quite classically by participating in professional fairs where they engage in brain-hunting.
"We try to reach the graduates by participating in trade shows."
"For example, at the solar technology fair," says Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company based in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms Stübe was aware of the problem of succession.
Currently, 35 positions are put to the competition on the company's website.
"At present, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It's expensive and takes a lot of time," he says.
Another way to make contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Freiburg.
"Professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to do professional internships or write his/her graduation project at home."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
That's why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often a large group can't do that," says Stübe, Chief of Staff.
Money has long lost its primary role in job search.
Flexible hours of work, childcare or good opportunities for promotion are other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among Germany's top 100 employers.
The Institute is an annual honour table for German employers.
To this end, it questions employees about their level of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the employees' framework conditions.
The Chief of Staff, Ms Stübe, hopes that this placement will enhance the image of the company among job seekers.
"I think the candidates rely mainly on external evaluations for a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means, above all, taking internal action.
"The best way for an employer to make himself attractive is through his own employees," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand within its own workforce.
"satisfied collaborators are the best messengers."
When employees are properly treated and identified with the company, they themselves advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," says Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, the southeastern state of the United States, in the coming years.
The Washington government has imposed a ban on an equivalent ban and, thus, definitively rescinded its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is currently prohibited.
Home Secretary Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
The explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform is the reason for this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of this accident, which cost the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to allow further drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters of this solution want to reduce the US' dependence on foreign countries for oil supplies.
The question of who bears the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the golf course has not, to date, been definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing billions of claims for compensation, is at the centre of the charges.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling freeze decreed after the platform's explosion.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tougher security instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after numerous accusations of corruption, is currently undergoing extensive reform.
At the same time, Obama announced that they would remove the lucrative tax niches of gas and oil groups.
Stakeholders in this sector are now publicly warning that the supply rate in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's objective is to curb the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector" according to the results of a current survey conducted in the sector by the BDO audit firm, before the drilling ban imposed on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing into the rivers is oiled brown; it emits a smell similar to that that exists in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live on theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist said to journalists to calm them down: "You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian attempted to photograph a young man plunged into muddy water to the chest, as well as the greasy drag that surrounds him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the burst of water in the color of the rainbow.
It cannot be seen that the basement is full of brown tables of crude oil.
On the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells us that she used to collect shrimp in whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil burst out of a pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the neighbouring small town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The full extent of the ravages is evident when mangrove marshes are crossed by streams.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat splits brown cradish water. Anyone who dips his hand in it removes it all covered with oil.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the ground like licorice sticks. Isolated palms sadly let their palms hang.
We look in vain for the clouds of birds, as we usually encounter in wetlands: As soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence falls on this paradise of old that looks like a gas station by the smell it emits.
"What is happening here is war on the environment," says Celestine Akpobari in a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The area where the Ogoni live is a battlefield besieged for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. The latter was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to interrupt its production activities in this area because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the return to the Ogoni country is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the Ogoni country's oil fields are unexploited, because the situation there is too unstable for this oil group.
Every few hundred meters stand in the water of steel treteals as strange sculptures: "Christmas trees" are very affectionately referred to as borehole heads.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are rodented by corrosion to the marker.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time in pieces, as a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion litres have spilled into the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to the amount that happened in the sea during the crash of the super oil tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the largest environmental catastrophes in human history.
Who should be responsible for persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, the sabotage and siphoning of pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists consider blasts of drilling heads and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner criticized the Shell Group for applying essentially less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of pipe failure is "almost higher than the rate of alarm."
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of camboose and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with camboose to the neck.
A fire sparkles under one of the many barrels that sometimes connects to the pipes, sometimes scattered without motif on the site must be repeated: a small underground refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
As a first step, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then at the end of the kerosene drop pipe falls and diesel is finally obtained.
For example, Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-litre diesel drums every day: "It's bringing us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
Delta residents benefit from the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than the ridiculously low price of just 40 Euro cents per litre of Diesel: because they buy their raw material free of charge.
It is offered by the "protectors" who drill the pipeline network throughout the Ogoni country. According to experts, the country loses in this way at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a very insignificant small part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: The organized crime networks, which also include politicians and high-ranking military personnel, charge the lion's share in tankers and rob it on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers that the debate on whether to attribute the environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or to the lax mode of production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and the foundations of fishermen's lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries."
But, in the meantime, the Ogoni's relations with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was only a matter of the group's withdrawal. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will prove better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you left," announces the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers may appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers mainly from the north of the country intend to enjoy the raw material like all Nigerians.
"In any case, this damn thing has brought our country down a lot," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major safety problem.
In examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "disaster failure of the reactor."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, the Airbus passengers belonging to Quantas had obviously had more luck so far: In the course of its investigation, the Australian Aviation Safety Authority found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft presented a serious safety problem, and warned against a possible construction defect.
This potential failure could have serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of the oil pipe, it is said in a position paper published this Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of reactors".
This applies to reactors manufactured by Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 A380-series aircraft.
The Quantas company's Airbus, which had to land urgently on November 4 in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, giving her the opportunity to take further legal action against society.
Quantas' director, Alan Joyce, stated that his company would claim damages for the incident at the beginning of November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, oil inflammation is the cause of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be conducted on superjumbos that are also equipped with the subject reactors.
The security recommendations are the result of collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety issue is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the aircraft's emergency landing, the Quantas airline had grounded its entire A380 fleet for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa replaced the A380 reactor as a precautionary measure.
The two-stage aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall throughout the territory causes chaos in transportation
Germany covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany blush: By freezing temperatures, almost the whole republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimetres in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On National A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff worked on a permanent basis, but they were able to overcome the snow that continued to accumulate.
In addition, violent gusts swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Marine Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects this tidal wave to take place on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow piles on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the weather alert station Meteomedia announced the purple alert level was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In some places, it fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and cool winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars remained stuck there at night.
Even in the land of Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On Highway A2, snow and wind caused traffic interruption and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious disruption of rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, trees falling on railways, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, inter-regional transport between Leipzig and Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train with blankets, food and beverages.
Snow winds swept the roads.
Snowfalls have led to numerous flight cancellations at Germany's main airports.
According to a spokesperson for the standard and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport reports that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides permanent service.
It is true that passengers stuck at the airport are no longer numerous, despite which only 400 beds are made available.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit at a crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver's lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car rolled on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: The snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will swirl in case of slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by strong and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, up to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to newspaper reports, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could bring in up to 500 million euros.
The Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group's headquarters: The twin towers located in the Business District have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group is clearly trying to recover the renovation costs and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesperson.
This spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we're checking to see if it's more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or sell them, and to lease them again later".
Thus, the largest financial institution in Germany has already given up its seat, shortly thereafter.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for an amount of EUR 272 million from the equity holders and then rehabilitated them.
The transformations aimed at energy optimisation have swallowed up, according to some indications, about 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector estimate the value of the towers, which in the meantime were renamed "Green Towers", at around 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesperson, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the miners who have perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for buried miners who were reported dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
The bodies had not yet been able to be traced because the security situation of the damaged well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the damaged well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue team was able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that minors no longer had a chance to survive.
Until now, the bodies could not be reassembled.
Today, parents and friends organized a party in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a bright sun in Greymouth south of New Zealand Island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothing and surfboards, were also included.
The flags were half-masted in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants of the commemorative celebration that New Zealand has nurtured the hope that the miners will rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the pits said that he cannot resign himself to accept his son's death until he sees his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Police Prefect Gary Knowles explained to reporters that when explosive gas masses are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter film an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the ancient genre thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising", epic of the fighter.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of by turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal murder methods. When he is in a bad mood, he rips out the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to be dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the blind man says no word about his real name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, the detour of one or two sentences some appalling cries of agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and we celebrate in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the setting of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travel.
When a film targets multiple target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
The director Winding Refn has been considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy relating to the fierce and full of style drug dealer, as a kind of Danish Quentin Taratnon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to the art and essay cinema.
Most art cinema sympathizers must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and the intestines.
The amateurs of action films die of boredom, when the one-eyed embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
It is no wonder then that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributors in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that have earned some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not a question of dialogues in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
The viewer can't escape it.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with icy images and a gloomy soundtrack, but above all with an elusive hatred that springs out of the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully beside the blind, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything else, the one-eyed hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning himself into a warrior, is perhaps sent from the devil himself.
It represents rotting, but perhaps also, just for those who are, anyway, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, with the purpose of annoyance, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications for a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, let alone submit to the Agency's controls.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007, around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest town nearby is 30 kilometres away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in IAEA documents, as it refers to the reactor that Syria apparently built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepipede, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a briefing by the United States intelligence services, the CIA, dating back to the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby locality, el-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium, which would allow the manufacture of atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation featuring fuzzy satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the probable location of each reactor component prior to the destruction of the power plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even the interior of it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be commissioned, but was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is barely more information than at the time, and even over time the mystery is getting thicker and thicker.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor at al-Kibar, but had little' clues showing that country was developing "an active nuclear weapons program".
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "presumptive reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation as "plausible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as at the IAEA.
When asked how he made sure that he was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic response in the summer, claiming that the IAEA had "sufficient documentation to ask questions".
The Syrians certainly hastily removed the rubble of the "unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical flattening of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of uranium produced by men in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images from commercial providers from one Member State showing the moment that directly followed the attack, which appears to be more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret atomic programme and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found at the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after particle analysis, calling it implausible.
Since then, Damas has refused to discuss this, as well as satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow the monitors to carry out a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and refuses access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel remains stubbornly silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this".
For example, the investigation of this case has been going on since June 2008 without a result being achieved and "is increasingly becoming a serious credibility issue for the Agency", as recognized by a high-ranking Western diplomat serving at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, and is ultimately a serious violation of the nuclear-weapon-ban treaty.
The IAEA considers that progress requires clarification of the existence of the other three facilities that must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities they are dealing with here, what their function is, or what they are suspected of being contained.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also by the names of nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C., has identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspected objects.
It is possible that it is located in or directly adjacent to a military base; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to IAEA inspectors at all three sites.
In Vienna, it is claimed that Syrians fear that the inspection group would actually be spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that attracts the attention of nuclear inspectors.
IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have shuttled between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat stated in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serve for fuel production".
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities", such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works with unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible assumptions about the following fundamental questions: where should the uranium have come from and where the plutonium needed for the manufacture of the bomb would have been separated later.
It is not known whether rubble, which could hide valuable traces, has been stored at all three sites.
Once the hundreds of trucks loaded with land have disappeared, no one will have information about the place where the rubble is stored.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria would have had the al-Tibni salt mine examined in 1998, located only a few kilometres from al-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River, to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
In a recent analysis of satellite photographs taken on behalf of the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked them to the reactor in question.
Satellite photographs, however, show that Syria undertook earthworks at the three suspect sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began to demand access to these locations.
It may be a coincidence, but it has not helped to rule out suspicions.
He said in the diplomatic community that the IAEA had spent several months preparing a plan for inspections to be carried out there, which was intended to allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time invested shows how much interest inspectors have in this matter.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the United States ambassador who has been talking about what is known as special inspections for the last few months, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The Director of the IAEA, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has certainly already mentioned "an option to which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitant.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented in it have no desire to see the situation escalate.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who says, "Would it be useful to do that, if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in times of war
It's been bad since Angelina Jolie made her summer debut as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing more is known about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
There is persistent rumour that the woman, a Muslim woman, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the Yugoslavian War.
Bosniak women's federations immediately protested. In response, some film footage planned for Sarajevo was moved to Hungary at the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests are still continuing in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet the actress. Jolie is herself a goodwill ambassador of UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago she offered these women a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario tells a lot about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights withdraw the status of goodwill ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, by the way, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, granted a filming permit to Sarajevo after some hesitation, but it is not known why it did not come in spite of this authorization.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a great deal of effort that she has become aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She maintains that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give all the interested parties the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: Lovers knew each other well before the start of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is still a big difference with the version "a rape victim loves her executioner".
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, as Jolie says, is "unfair and based on erronized information".
From now on, only Hollywood fanatics can provide him with peace: By illegally putting this scenario on the Net, like many others before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, everything's fine with the Irish again.
No sign of consternation.
This is why the local team overly dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy against the background of strong music, they trip feet.
Cork's Baileyu-Pub in southern Ireland vibrates because players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in beer cups from the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong". The winner grabs 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to go to Las Vegas in January to attend the world beer-pong championship.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the unsettling question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his plans. In January, he will lead hiring interviews in New Zealand.
"I have a strange feeling though," he says.
"The country of birth is so far away and I don't have a job there."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as event manager, perhaps a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Due to the gloomy prospects at home, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, his brother Colin now holds a position as a computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts at the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even expect a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are made, it will be a flow of emigration comparable to that of Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish enjoyed great ease, sorrow now takes its place.
The economic crisis, however, affects especially the well-trained Irish young people, who have so far had only moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social deprivation seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's money in excess.
In the meantime, however, three out of every ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times publishes extensively the letters of readers written by young emigrants who complain: "In Ireland, everything is drifting."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the possibilities, goes away and our country thus a whole generation."
"The last one to leave turned off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future as the government is just throwing powder at the eyes and offering young people no prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades cling from one unpaid practical internship to another.
She states that her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However men like Stephen McLarnon try to positively address this theme.
McLarnon organises the "WorkingAbroadExpo" trade fair, which offers full support on the theme "Working abroad".
"But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," says the manager.
His website shows pictures of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a mess, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For the past six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was nothing left to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector and Germany.
A fashion house just came out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his native country, as he participates in an additional workstation, in order to be able to complete the repayment of the credit contracted to build his home in the native country.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I hardly live anymore."
He bursts out of an embarrassed laugh as he crosses the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars from major brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, 100 percent financed by the credit.
"These were moments of madness, without a doubt, money was easy," he says.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan reflects for a moment, tightens hot tea and says: "I have no children to maintain and I am young; even everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The building engineer doesn't like the lamentations he's often heard lately.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as dramatic as we once experienced here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe it is what makes us feel Irish first.
He then laughs and talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after spending seven years there and, in Ireland, life continued, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future and discover how life goes elsewhere.
In his list, He already has a few years of work in London. That's why life shouldn't be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that worries him very much in recent days: the party to be organised on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's worried she won't be able to turn into a farewell party.
"Only, not much emotion," he said, drinking a long sip of beer.
"Bye-bye, it's still worrisome."
"Let's call it a goodbye party, all relaxed, bringing together some friends, with some drinks and some games."
Democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro poll taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows the changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after experiencing a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same as last year but with a sharp increase of 25% in 2001 (Chart 3)
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but up sharply compared to 2003 (17 and 24% respectively).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shook support for democracy.
While this was successful during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many American countries have suffered only a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say that they or someone close to them have been the victims of a crime in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela agree (and 80% support the private enterprise); although their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private enterprises.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered to be the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the disaster-stricken country and plunged into fear.
Ballot boxes and a new ballot, ballots scattered in the gutters, ransacked polling stations and intimidation were introduced.
Polls were open late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced as a result of the January earthquake, wandered in the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favourites, denounced the fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, regards the event as "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they “did not believe that these irregularities, however serious they may be, had necessarily invalidated the process”.
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents owe it to René Préval, unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared invalid.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no visible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second round, reaches the second round.
With an epidemic of cholera raging, and more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, needed to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are important.
Donors see the election of a legitimate people's government as an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
In the weeks after suddenly becoming a widow, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, benefited from a wave of sympathy from the public that improved her approval rate by 20 points, to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Mrs Fernández, apparently in mourning, according to which she would abandon or not the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra revenue at will.
Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation sank into disarray following Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian hit one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President even more room for manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy is overheating widely: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and union wage demands, see this figure as close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and purged INDAC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy was boosted by high world prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the boost to growth following a strong devaluation in 2002.
That is perhaps why Mrs Fernández is showing signs of wanting to re-establish Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government entered into an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its maturities in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, economic minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which looks like a prelude to the consolidation of INDAC.
It is not clear if Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term of office, now that her husband is no longer at her side.
If she does, she needs to gain support from the middle class, among whom Kirchnerism is highly advocated.
When the Argentinians returned from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her would have reflued.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether to repudiate many of her husband's policies without noise.
Half a hurrah for China
Taiwanese voters are moving towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his older brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million electors ran on November 27, or 70% of eligible people, to elect mayors and municipal councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings about the continent, having forged innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the biggest reorganisation of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) won three of the five town halls, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (DPP), which leaned towards Taiwan's full independence, won nearly 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including busy country trucks and mass gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal outfits.
A mandatory mysterious assassination attempt was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien, purely through his face, wounding him and killing a passer-by.
Oddly enough, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to harm Mr. Link or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
In any event, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking to see how absent the question of the continental part itself was.
Instead, the candidates added to the plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from fuelling anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, sought confirmation as to whether his policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back to the fold.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let's start from the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, he was ill: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on charges of corruption.
From 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur in favour of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under Ms. Tsai's leadership and the PDP is making every effort to attract professionals and youth.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it too can engage with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party has a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results had they insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic, not to run for the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will find it difficult to choose between its potential candidates.
The KMT needs to do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite staggering economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT said that his cabinet and its local offices would be reorganized.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese view economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Awards nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
Carry out at the request of a President, and people are required to read it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer hand-picked by President Obama to perform at her 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the Grammy Awards surprises this year with a large-scale nomination in the category of "Best New Artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains somewhat mysterious but is consistent with Grammy Award rules according to which an artist must not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skillful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line at Spalding compared to Norah Jones' fulgurant success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Award voters by taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy Award voters have rightly honoured Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "instrumental album" category, a trip on an invigorating thrill of a recording that was one of the top favorites last year.
Among these Iyers, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a favorite in the raucous New Orleans voice and frequent guest at HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also strongly leans towards a definite fusion with Stanley Clarke's, John McLaughlin's and Jeff Lorber's albums.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, won some well-deserved recognitions in the grand ensemble category; in competition with Billy Childs Ensemble's rich chamber-jazz and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his byte's live was a fine example of this bassist's democratic hand as a band leader.
Grammy Awards nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of music and composers from around the world.
At the top of the nominations, mention "Deus Ex Machina" by Michael Daugherty, for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California are the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No.4, "Los Angeles", a work commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also competing for a reward.
The classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, operal, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The classical album nominations are Bruckner's Symphonys No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the category of opera, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of the Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphony-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoe" by Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition count Pärt for Symphony No.4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony #4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he had written the 15-minute work especially for the performer at the Avi Avital mandolin, which played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York City.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of ranges and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received an appointment in the category of orchestra performances, for having conducted the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received a nomination were pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalist-solist nominees; here they are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Racines: my life, my song"
The Temecula Mosque project won the approval of the planning commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics attacked the project claiming that it promoted both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you mention it," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, speaking on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it, as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the centre, at roughly the same speaking time, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America fell."
The planned Islamic centres also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including the Ground Zero, the site of the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 families co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24.943 square foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32-hectare site on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, widens the field to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say this shows that life has opportunities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organization has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or arsenic."
"That's why it's very special, even though it's far from being a truly "foreign" life form," commented Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacterium, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We wonder what's still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
Discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of an alien life.
This was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms may be able to use other elements to operate biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Spatial Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element for another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; for example, it speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to substitute for each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behaviour is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms find it difficult to distinguish these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and, in a way, erases the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
Researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing levels of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic may occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea, that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new; but nothing has ever shown that this could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of the Earth's existence, she says, so researchers hypothesized that early life forms could have used it.
This suggests that there might be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at first," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs were found in Compton
The other two show dogs out of four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, the Los Angeles County sheriffs announced it Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two akitas and two Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower motel 6, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the evening Wednesday, told Steve Whitmore, the spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," Whitmore says.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood, and in what circumstances they were discovered.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
Dog owners Kristina Rickard and David Peek could not be reached to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a county animal refuge in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were safe and sound, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of Japanese dog owners, were missing until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the Long Beach national champion "AKC/Eukanuba", where they planned to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba", Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the couple's almost a month-long canine show tour.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the motels and park their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell burrow and a Breton spaniel - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so the dogs could look fresh.
Peek and Rickard reported the van was stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM waits only for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York, on Thursday officially praised the "pre-packaged" plan by creditors that about $5 billion of the debt would be wiped out; paving the way for the entertainment company, having 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With Thursday's decision, according to which the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, no legal obstacles remain before MGM to recover to the tutelage of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general managers of what will be a light studio.
Staff will be reduced to approximately 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase enters into a $500 million credit facility to fund new operations and productions of MGM.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which is itself facing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was engaged to advise management on how to place its finances as it could not afford to pay interest of $300 million per year.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the studio's more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the additional $2 billion sought by creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be redone as the MGM team had begun to work on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially came out of bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper received multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which raised $375,000 a month for their management services of the company, will receive a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum intend to relaunch the production of MGM, which has released only one film this year, and to create an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must enter into a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to fund its share in these two films, which must be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM's debt, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech Toys to Keep Your Gift Budget Balanced
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful toy is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make a significant breach in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jumpstrings, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technology toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best-known ones, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button battery toys are increasing, as are rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are stuffed toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when you squeeze them on their stomachs.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second one makes it possible to compose a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start pressing, you can no longer stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by Elmo Live's technology last year, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turns like Simon Says and can perform the lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will remember Alphia, one of the first computer-based educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a backpack filled with quiz cards designed to turn a ride into a car session with a self-correction and a valve binder.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3-8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games don't educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3-12 years old), this is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a more recent and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card entry that displays family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a match box, each having its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before the time runs out, this is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
More and more, toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in the toy shops, the two largest ones are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6 to 12 years old) that includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credit at Club Penguin store for two items of choice.
These can be roller skates or a pet Puffle toy.
Slightly larger than the hair on the tip of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the last button-pile micro-robot.
The false bug moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicone pastas in random directions.
It is fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It's also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage through our dog's mouth.
Bringing a softer side to the maintenance of law and order in China
Tang Shenbin surveyed a place in the city as an urban sergeant to training by severely inspecting his nerve loads, issuing low-voice orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan - imposing officials of public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and their inclination for violence - to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"Do you have a right!"
"Be piercing!"
Show them, he said, "what do pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely spent their teens in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-coloured jackets and trousers, froze at home.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned to the ruler.
Four neat hats perfectly perched at the top of hair tied by a striped knot in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city required all new recruits to have a higher degree.
Guangdong Province traded the grey-green uniforms for a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced the lower-eyes with the strong way:: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black glances, firmly for half an hour, until the colporteur packed his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in urban areas with 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, shape and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have difficulty attracting attention to this underground urban brigade in China.
And for good reason, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media portray the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei province beat to death an observer after he used his mobile phone to film them scattering a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and posted, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without bloodshed.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon peddler was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained to assault street vendors.
"Chengguan marked the government," lamented last year China Daily, a national publication, after an umpteenth tactical controversy.
The newspaper called for a "full clean-up."
Skeptics say the approach is far from it.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real jobs or whether they were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's announcement required female candidates, between the ages of 18 and 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five facial features in the right order."
They must be larger than average, 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
The officers stated that the work was physically too painful for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are appropriate; these are height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come the temperament and the "inner qualities."
The women of Chengguan are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not agree with this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement for the order of facial features.
That it means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
It is true that persons with disabilities or disfigured persons must not apply.
"We can't let a lame person or a hunchback come here to serve," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheeks appleted with a finely curved mouth.
She did not consider the enhancement of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked in disillusioned air.
Xu Yang, his colleague with dimples aged 21, says, "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They did not object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they had greater career ambitions than simply hunting vendors into the alleys where they were supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team confronts a dozen walking merchants who travel quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as much as possible bread rolls or bowls of tofu before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We have already told you several times!" said Mrs. Xu as a salesman fled on foot, temporarily abandoning her noodle cart bike.
Officers describe their duties rather as monotonous than arduous.
"It's about the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, revolted after the spread of false rumours that chengguan agents had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen chengguan policemen and agents were injured, 14 government vehicles were hit or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from placid Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
The officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle was shouting at the scandal.
A 15-minute arm of iron followed before the police officers, in a sinister face, made their way to their vehicle with their elbows and left at all speeds with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xwedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 or over - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," says Mr. Li Said in a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the audience that starts."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Attorneys in the Department of Justice have lifted criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, arising from a case involving an assistant from an old campaign and his efforts to obtain lobbying work for the wife's husband, announced the honourable senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal surrounding his case did national headlines last year and harm his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" by the decision, the result of a one-year investigation.
The honourable senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign's counsel stated that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer under investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this matter."
The Department of Justice has refrained from commenting on this issue.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, according to which there would be significant evidence that Mr. Ensign had conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, initially released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr.Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's case with her.
Hampton once served as treasurer in an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator with Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for a year by law from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
The ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends prior to the case, seems to conflict with the so-called ban on the rotating door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that was made public, "there appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and materially violate the revolving door law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the department's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department appeared to be wary of political prosecution after a number of high-level setbacks received by its Public Integrity Section, including last year's decisions to drop the prosecution of former Senator Ted Stevens accused of failing to prosecute.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms," said Melanie Sloan, Director General of Citizens for Accountability and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basicly says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, senior counsel for Mr. Ensign, stated in an interview that on Monday he had received a telephone call from a Department of Justice prosecutor and a follow-up the following day, telling him that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed on Wednesday in a press release, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the Public Prosecutor's Office.
"I'm not comfortable getting into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that Mr. Ensign's $96,000 payment to the Hamptons violated the federal election law.
The election commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr.Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "marteling" the Ministry of the Interior on an issue in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to schedule a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr.Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth-ranked Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for several months, Mr.Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr.Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, said that the honourable senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were beating away in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent reports of horrible testimonies via Twitter every minute.
In the end, the defence said that there were over 140,000 messages about the rape trial and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence with the court that outlines appellate arguments, which could occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reports on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - have created a "circuit atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury has been poorly influenced by the public's passions.
The request could prompt appeal judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experienced this in this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms is undermining human rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the State Superior Court, laconically rejected the claims in last week's judgment, claiming that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
Appeal courts have for decades recognized that media coverage of notorious cases may raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 judgment, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his decision that there was a "carnaval atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
Crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The fugitive".
Some lawyers have stated that the appeal courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules may be needed to manage the means of communication of the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue argues that some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is only one of many described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, which could be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defence counsel also argue, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered harm when Blue J. refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors reported being horrified by photos of victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of prosecutors, and that he improperly put pressure on a verdict by making the unusual decision to get the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for governorship and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media were constantly fanning the flames of the case's emotion.
"The daily jolt of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "did not look like anything that had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion that the instant news was more incendiary than the press releases delivered more slowly was a luddist view that would impoverish the Court's policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers have stated that appeal courts are often attracted to arguments that social and technological changes require court adaptation.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their file, they refer to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility bring cleavages closer together?
After a campaign marked by invectiveness and negativity, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a forerunner of genuine bipartite cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and Congress leaders produced no breakthrough on the major issues to be addressed during the "Luck Duck" session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
Wednesday's public meeting of the Committee on the Chairman's deficit was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological divide; but which, however, still divides the members.
This is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a period of trial and mutual testing with a view to obtaining signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments by participants revealed a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxation, spending, health care or rights, both parties stay miles away.
Yet the November election moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now alongside the Center for Ethical and Public Policy.
"It's inevitable after the election.
The elections arouse partisan passions and then fade away.
That's good."
On some issues, notably those on the agenda of the "Limp Duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of them, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, more optimism was expressed on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "Limp Duck", with the ratification of the "New START" Pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
"Once the things that have to be done are done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared scepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what is going on between today and 2012 as a pre-spectacle or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons for this are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present at the tea which contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, pushing back the retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their opinion, imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have struggled to reach that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected members of the group; this suggests that there is little reason or willingness to compromise on tax matters, at least today.
Galston is planning two phases in the fighting between the White House and Congressional Republicans.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan confrontations, as Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care; and then be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead end, as in 1995, then both parties will closely observe the reaction of the public.
The one who will be judged to be in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there were then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But much more effort is needed on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
US documents leaked describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and passes through the Kremlin some of the bribes and protection money it collects, the US Embassy in Russia reported in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of power" - is taking its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington as Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but there have since been few traces of cleaning.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the charges of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation lawsuits on these charges.
In September, he told a Russian television channel, when questioned about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's to be thrown, it's anything."
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information set out in an embassy report; and it is unheard of that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow City government and crime has led some people to name it "dysfunctional" and assert that the government functioned more as a kleptocracy than a government," according to the Embassy's note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (a term used in the criminal world/mafia that literally means "roof" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through all the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts to identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and militias are on second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt detectives are at the lowest level."
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB is brewing money from the largest companies and that the police are targeting small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to get protection from the MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high."
The note notes that although the collection of money is extensive, protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev referred several times to the fight against corruption but admitted little progress.
The embassy note transmits reports of men bringing suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview with Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's think tank Indem.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"He's not part of a political class because there's none in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to Indiam, the cost of corruption is estimated to be more than $300 billion a year across Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the note of the American embassy, which was only realized yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will stir with certainty discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow's failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is solving the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted with anger to the statements that US diplomats had leaked by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem lies in the fact that this is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he says.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that this would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, as you know, in opposition to ethics."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with low-quality decrepit concrete walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School evoked the man who built it, the last chief of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here likes Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as the "butcher" for his brutality, when he was head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in north-west Cambodia where he had hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure built; and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally being questioned at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual there that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly run by the United Nations, handed down its first sentence concerning a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing to 35 years in prison the former head of Tuol Sleng's notorious torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
In the face of these developments, anxiety has increased among the former Khmer Rouge combatants in Anlong Veng; complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There are resentments and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of Cambodia's Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation creates divisions within families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrow the U.S. Pol Pot government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurgency that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led guerrilla warfare at their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defection to the government, culminating with the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge ex-combatants have fallen into black poverty, common to rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic about the movement.
Although some Khmer Rouge elite officers retained their positions as local leaders in exchange for laying down arms, they are low-ranking, unskilled farmers.
"These people received very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are mired in the regime's agrarian utopian ideology."
"They were raised in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, aged 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before moving in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to provide for ourselves."
The Khmer Rouge court in progress has also caused concern here.
The court is expected to start the trial early next year of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to try senior officials and key perpetrators of crimes, but it did not say whether it was pursuing beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to Im Chaem, 64, former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers were reportedly killed.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from work to the field located near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said.
"If there's more prosecution, there'll be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court sued several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, of the documentation centre.
"The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces," he says.
"We need to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, Composed of 75 Pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history textbooks of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They're suspicious because they don't know exactly how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are starting to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge keep a powerful atrait here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a path, invaded by weeds and sprinkled with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31-year-old, roadside mobile phone saleswoman, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and, later that day, she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to abandon its stockpile of military-grade uranium
The government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will abandon its stock of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decison is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the margins of a security summit.
The US government had tried for years to convince Belarus to abandon highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But US officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarus research center.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to an official who referred to the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, convened by Obama, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to provide an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit, in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves to me that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" made by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under George W. Bush's administration.
At the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and low enriched uranium," said Mr Lukashenko.
"This is our product... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're just going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus moved closer to the United States a few months ago; however, by showing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated as the equipment had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled over 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was flown, according to officials.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with low enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"Detailed coordination and organization have been implemented to build confidence," leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the Energy Department specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates of the James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies, this year Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilos of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to the harsh repression of human rights by Lukashenko.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognised that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improving bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has not raised any objections to CIA flights
The government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in the direction of Guantanamo across Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the United States ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the filtered (cable) documents by Wikileaks at the daily El País, which add that the first vice-president of the government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed in order "to demonstrate that they were exercising adequate vigilance on foreign planes that were crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, a meeting was held between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "surprised the Zapatero Government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega pointed out that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken off guard," Aguirre tells in a cable.
The incumbent of the Ministry of External Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest profile possible, even though, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
In turn, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he was not going to block the initiative of the judge to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (NIC) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no criminal elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless shown concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than for the declassified information of CNI o of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly manipulate the case between governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, during a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and Internal Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even though Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "so that they avoid comments of a fiery rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expressed concern for the work of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even though these revelations have negative consequences for the United States Government," she says.
The parricide that passed the confession complained in a network of the "accident" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname that she uses as soon as she was small, communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; the two originally from Noia, the village of La Coruña from which she originated.
The messages date from 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of his parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Soon after they broke up, we found out she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
We found another new boyfriend soon after that.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to search the labour market, the boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idyll fractured, they separated.
In March 2008 she is in Minorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and upset for the fact that I came to work there."
"When I told him, it seemed a good thing to him, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day long and not to have the freedom to do what he wants".
And then, she's talking about a mobile message she just got: "I want you to come home this month or you give me an address to send the child to you."
Ella complains, "If she doesn't like it, let the kid go with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home," she claims.
In May, she talks about the re-entry to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'll only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to report to a workstation in order not to lose it."
She explains that if everything was all right, she would have taken her elder with her.
"He will remain with the correct person, i.e. with me, and I will never leave him with another person in my life if that person is not my mother", doubtful intention, taking into account their bad relations.
In July, there's another post.
When she hits him, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and he had allegedly been murdered on the 10th, died.
"Cesar's happy on one side, but he's not happy on another."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes this place a little bit, but on the other he goes to school almost every day".
She's talking about a trip to Majorca.
"He will go there (the child) a few hours in summer and so I save a little money from the babysitter".
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you'll come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to the email, you see, when he wants to, he finds me, shit".
On the 30th, another: "The child is good, and goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there's one: "I'm getting money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Galician error (epigraph)".
The last man who lived with her, a watchman, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything had gone by so she hadn't told him that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the Provincial Prison in Palma yesterday, from the Judicial Detainees Centre in Minorca.
The ex-officio lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the facts had happened, "and she also had no intention of harming the minor."
Before she confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and putting her corpse in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric trial.
People's Party members would gain 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9 seats.
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the large increase in votes and deputies recorded in the last autonomic elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation obtains in these comices normally doubles that which it receives in the Catalans.
For example, the Catalan popular won 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while the 2006 autonomics won 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384.091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, desired of a diversion of votes from the PSC and the retention of the PP electorate, the analysts of this formation calculated that, if there would be general elections, the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also earn four (it now has 10) and PSC would lose no more or less than 9 MPs (it has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - he has three now - while ICV would keep one MP or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the next meeting would take place in May of 2011 for the municipal comices, where the people can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and people agree that PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not obtain the majority either the possibility of using their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fanciful for this party to lose its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes-.
The PP increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lerida, the PP recorded only a 500-vote difference compared to PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, they met several times.
People have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels and Reus.
At present, PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerians detained by agents of the General Information Commissariat of the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell which, headed from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaeda groups, between which "The Tigers for the Liberation of Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the perpetrator of the Bombay attacks that caused the deaths of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the extent that with "Operation Kampai" has been "debilitated" Al Qaeda's falsification apparatus at the international level and therefore "its operative capacity".
The investigators calculate that the cell, within the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that integrated the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" could cross European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network held operative in Europe, that is why in the investigations participated, apart from Thai services, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days similar blows to that recorded the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were detained in Thailand, with the capture of the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones running the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be on behalf of young men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
Investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connect detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay bombing, even though the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiver groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that a few days before this attack was carried out, Catalonia was sent through a transfer agency a few miles of dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after by the members of the "commando" who killed 106 people.
The police took a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his inauguration as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exhibited during the campaign and which are limited to giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philosophical-sovereignist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to approach half of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that the oppositions will exercise abstain in the vote of the nomination.
On a possible agreement with the PP depend on the future alliances that nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general election, but for the time being, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are done in Catalan key.
And as far as the President of the PP is concerned, in order to support a inauguration "it would have to eliminate all the sovereignist and independenceist speeches", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - which the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to make the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomic administration lose weight and the elimination of the tax applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of the negotiation on the inauguration of Mas will deal with PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not due to "lack of measurements"
Olot centre owners do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
Geriatric officials La Caritat d'Olot (Girona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible in the meantime that he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself with the centre's lawyer, Joan Cañada and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be to be able to charge the person responsible" for the deaths but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civilian officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for failing to detect in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day on he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - because he suspected that in many cases no doctor would personally explore the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures can at no time have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there is only a hint of recklessness on the part of any person other than the accused".
The person already baptized as "the Angel of Death" confessed the day before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused her death by injecting her with a sober-dose insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mixture of sedative pellets.
The director of La Caritat mentioned that it is complicated to control the access of the centre's staff to medicine.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the interns, used to kill them.
But the laboratory analyses will clarify if Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the meantime 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of assassinations confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way of killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
Peripheral differentials have closed to strength and the actions of European banks have suffered more than 5%.
However, we must also not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes and the euro has barely recorded an increase, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market which in the same way as it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by fences of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose fear.
A month ago, ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
Bundesbank demanded the completion of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, it is hoped that the current liquidity measures "at least until March" will be extended and that the unlimited quarterly auction will continue at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not fulfil the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and they collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse on the market.
Yesterday the one-year auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have dropped 30 basis points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland figures for the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potentials and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the numbers are combustible in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a state of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures which the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to reactivate employment sound like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange has suffered 4.5%, the double that the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and we are enjoying the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it resolves itself with strong demand and helps to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain asking for a Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we don't need, the Treasury has over 40,000 million available liquidity, tripled compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to the sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "except for being, to appear."
Courage, we can make it!
The president of Eulen will challenge the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not cease in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, because he considers it "no one by law", the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the holding firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal drums for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of one part of the group.
The founder of the larger holding of business services for the companies does not seem willing to cede in his dispute to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
On his board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors at the meeting of shareholders on January 18 this year whose dispute is registered in the Register of Commerce and Corporations.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, again opened the thunderbox within the Álvarez family.
The use of the judge to fix the meeting is, until the dispute is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the meeting.
The latest movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "desperationary recourse of the applicants his five sons to try, through a processual argument, by clearly breaking the Law and abusing the law, to validate and correct the assembly radically null on 18 January", according to his official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for contesting the assembly once it has taken place, considering it to be "unlawful".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already unsuccessfully tried to have the magistrate convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless solicits usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue to be decided by the judge after the hearing on the motion for challenge for which there is not yet a specified date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret Siemens weapon
A software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the Formula One world in 2004, his history in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
In a first moment, no one took into account the options of a new stable that had just arrived, despite the ascending trajectory of the last seasons, the past November, in the final phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Ferrari by Fernando Alonso.
Without diminishing the skill as a driver of the champion, the German Sebastien Vette, neither the ability of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula One we speak of the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens company put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
It is in fact a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with goals far removed from the high motorsport competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly lines from manufacturing plants all over the world, power stations, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, accurately simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 plant allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians on their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season.
In Red Bull's team today work 180 young high-skilled professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project any kind of modifications on the cars.
Siemens CEO explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's cars except the engine, which is Renault's exclusive responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety components are modified.
Changes can move from virtual reality from simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced high-tech laser and autoclave production systems.
As a single limitation of this craziness of technological development there is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has established the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that's going on over there is considered "top secret."
The staff for this assignment is 580 people, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The Red Bull Formula One hero, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the huge technological resources that the energy beverage brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is priceless and zero awareness.
The plant's technology manager, Steve Nevey, says five years ago it could be said that the progress of R+D in the case of racing cars brought 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and the technology represents 85% of the success, while drivers bring the 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 clean shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first in the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational intends to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will count this initiative with the 16 zones already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's vice-president, Helena Herrero, gave an example of the redesigned shop located on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group prepared a plan to set up 200 brand outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes all 20 Spanish establishments.
The first open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops claims "to improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchase, assistance, post-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-class pioneering pilot program that solves the possible problems of HP's IT equipment as a guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is designed especially for MPEs and users, as the large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," remarked Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'flying' a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell's managing director, Jaime Guardiola, thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse of interest margins, which will be tried to partially offset with increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million particular customers, his task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011 that will last for three years.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to resort to FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market rating by capturing a million new private customers - 700,000 if one deduces those who can leave the bank-, its great task to accomplish, because so far this bank had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the private customer.
This year it has received 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market rating to the individuals is 3.5%, while to the companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans in the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its Optima master plan, established four years ago, even if initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for one more year.
Customers who let the savings banks slip away will be its main objective.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the war on liabilities - which penalises margins - is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and caisses pay for its issues in order to obtain liquidity are already moving at the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We didn't tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November-.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "larger dimensions will be sought."
"Everything will move next year," he assured.
He claims that capital needs "increase greatly" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that FROB can replace the market in the capture of funds in the case of new recapitalizations.
After having assured that Sabadell can survive the temporal closure of markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He pointed out that one cannot issue, but on the contrary of what happened in June, one can obtain short-term funding through rest, which alleviates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the caisses
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again stressed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the Spanish savings banks merger process began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would reserve themselves for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been carried out, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, they are adjustments."
"Most have been completed completely; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation too," the leader stressed.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Aragón Executives (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out within the time limits that have been set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he imphatized.
"The passage of 45 crates with an average of 28.500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75,500 million is an unprecedented trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to conform to Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of rather unhappy opinions about the slowness of the process" which show "a lack of serosity and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain is doing is reminding us that the deadline must be respected before the end of the year".
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarieta, yesterday assured that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world and he attributed to the people who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that began a process of concentration "very important" and "goes as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has managed well from the stress tests that ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin opted to stay in the euro, but it established the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have led to a doble government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private employment agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of assistance to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins with Chancellor Angela Merkel's criticism of her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, this is another restriction on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which shocks with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, in Germany we are beginning to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even though now it seems of science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, almost a 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macro-economic control, fiscal rigour, fines to the countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments by one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for a long time, so now there is no room for apology.
First, in 2009, when both IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (fiscal rigour plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second coup of the Central European country was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From then on it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and publication were against Greece's rescue.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel once again expresses a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's Treaties to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time forcing private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although slightly watered down, was approved and, in the following months, we should be attending the process of reforming the Union which makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think to cross.
And it tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not agree too much, from that date onwards the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the creation of a new monetary zone, in which countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves in cessation of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany warns us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a question of renewing the government deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're asked to do is a lot harder.
And what he must absolutely not do in these circumstances is deceive us ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will lead to greater peace and quiet.
And we know how to seize the opportunity we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard it of this form and his double declaration (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of the new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticisms, the path has been opened to the thesis that it is necessary to put order at home.
But the red line Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities we are considering, we cannot exclude the possibility of abandoning a monetary zone too full of countries that are not serious.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The ruses similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the will to escape punishment.
The expulsion in principle by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match of November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League caused a lot of ink on the anti-sport character of such behaviour and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the game (which their team already clearly won), both players deliberately wasted time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be leader of its group, both players will complete the regulatory sanction during the next barrage match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without boxes in the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned team coach José Mourinho and various economic sums to the players involved with two games.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, if not rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that appeared in the case relates to the fact that this had as protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (who in his hymn displays nobility and honor and who in past occasions sentenced his players to a fine for similar acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his dilated history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour does not expressly prohibit by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether with these actions one commits a fraud by law; for, in fact, they are actions respectful of the sports regulation, but seem to evade its meaning.
The question is to look at the type of harm they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that includes sportsmanship is the physical integrity of opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put in danger, i.e. there has been no violent play.
Another of these assets that are referred to with the correct game is to prevent the infractory players' team from profiting in an unfair way from the opposite team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not accommodate what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in hiding to try to avoid the sanction, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the referee.
They were waiting and they willingly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders get from the intentional faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put the rival in a disadvantage situation and one does not get an advantage in the same match either, because of course the result of the action presupposes leaving their own team with fewer players.
And that's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on those players.
Of course the advantage is that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that may threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, as the team could be eliminated all of a sudden and apart from that, with this action the players complete a penalty match and move on to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with one less than at the first round.
So, climbing the ladders, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, which is nevertheless part of the decision-making strategy that favours the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (it would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law),m otherwise they chose rather the moment in which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without foiling the penalty or running away from it.
Even though the boundary between genius and fraud of the law is diffuse, on this occasion I think we had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises because of two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the way in which the director was passed on to provoke them.
The evil caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to pick up Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the touron and the lottery, when December arrives also the group dinners before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen ball for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have led to an adjusted price offensive to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, coincide businessmen and industry associations interviewed.
To complete to complicate accounting, this year's calendar (as the night of St Sylvestre falls on Friday) concentrated requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 17th and the 17th) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying for their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all demand battle prices, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer's representative, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before they book."
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prizes," he says.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the tranche around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey of various institutions in the centre, we see the collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras Group points out that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the economic situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another of the most powerful group, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda et al.), the peculiarity of the calendar assumed more advance bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We did everything we could to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, remains optimistic after having detected a boom in billing since the second half and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that the 18th will also be hyper-active at the level of groups of friends who celebrate in advance the holidays.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, like Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies once again invite their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
On the part of the management Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, entrusts in the possibility to start seeing the final of the tunnel and argues that overall the reservations are "animated", even if the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That is true, the hope for the festivities has not fallen, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is causing great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks filtering confirms the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy of Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State filtered through the Wikileaks portal confirms the huge concerns that Pakistan's nuclear program is causing in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details on the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear programme — the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack — is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
For example, Pakistan's ambassador, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report prior to the visit of former National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise is running and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain custody.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the ever-reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of Pakistani production of nuclear weapons.
A dispatch from the Embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", argues: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end up with tacit support for terrorist groups".
Hunting for Wikileaks leader
Obama will count to a senior official for the fight against terrorism to avoid further infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have a certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, this one is not new, otherwise it dates from 20 November.
And this one has nothing to do with the last filtration of more than a quarter million United States diplomatic documents but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks's creative lawyer, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange".
On the 20th the international police force with headquarters in Lyon (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after having received permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol have been advised to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot issue an arrest order for an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organisation's explanations, regard the appeal red notice as a free path to arrest -- which the national police force must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where it is believed that Assange is located.
The movement outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday issued a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder was willing to answer Swedish authorities' questions by video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief of security of Stalin.
"It seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," denounces the missive.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday he gave from an undetermined location an interview to the editor of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he asked for the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to the American graduates they watch at the UN by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us at all," he said for CNN.
Obama himself instructed a senior anti-terrorist official, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesman to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who from January will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House has asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance".
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to go back on his statements after saying Assange would have to "be murdered".
"Obama should turn it into an objective and use an unmanned plane or something similar".
One person who did not ask for an apology was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, ex-Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"He who is in the government who filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not a execution would be too kind punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with nods to the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe for solving the umpteenth internal revolt inside ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that this cannot at all give him headaches that he had with other extinct currents.
That's why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with winks that allow him to blind himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballot papers, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to carry a certain penalty vote to the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the Chief of Staff wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he claimed that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to Bulgarian" would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand a little more from the president than to make his position available to militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximal organ between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive on a road map until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the National Council vote on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the Congress for the autumn of 2011, which the leaders consider a sure fact.
The ERC leader admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that its goal is to ensure that once and for all the organization is able to wash its laundry room with the family.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet has signed in his blog results symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five, two of which he points out.
The first, "recomposing" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, i.e., include new figures that come from the adept sector of Carod.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, he defends a reform of the statutes that allows the congresses to be carried out through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already struggled in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the conclave convulse of 2008 instructed the management to revise the assembly model in a specific congress to reform the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time could be good to take it back and close it forever.
23 implemented in November; 290 in 2010
According to the State of Mexico's MILEnio, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to MILEnio of the State of Mexico.
Between the murders mention is made of these of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut off in Valle de México.
During the penultimate month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
Between the cases one mentions that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, toluca municipius.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the blow of grace to the head, apart from the feet and hands tied with a cable.
The next day, the corpse of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the baggage port of an abandoned vehicle in the rue Mixtecas in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, of the Naucalpan municipality.
Very early on Thursday morning, the four, the owners of jointly exploited land found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the thorax, on the self-track near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipe Villa Guerrero.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day later in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots when he was leaving his house to initiate garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a gunshot to the head each in the settlement of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, a municipality in Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the forehead, we found the corpse of a man on a lonely path of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body we found a bullet struck with 25-caliber firearms.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water canal of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies carried out a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
Residents of Tepotzotlán alerted to the discovery of a corpse that was in Peña Colorada, hands tied behind and eyes blindfolded.
The man had an injury produced by a gunshot in the neck.
At half the month it was reported that two men had been executed who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, two death warning messages were found with the victims at the same time.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony one found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by The Incorrect.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the hamlet Zoquiapan of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the corpse of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, agreed with a message that his executors had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck, a woman's lifeless body was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin, Santa Muerte's tattoos and necklaces were detected with her image.
Towards the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the edge of a car in the Zinacantepec municipality with at least three bullet strikes and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of two men with their heads wrapped up and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what happens with those who do not align".
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín settlement.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message nearby; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a bristol with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country in COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it maintained its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 per cent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance in the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce coal footprints and reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, his country had inverted $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the last four years.
Nevertheless, he had made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in that area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all of these areas, including the approval last year of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives discussed with respect to greenhouse gas reduction, he explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local governments to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reductions.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans underway or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments in other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Programme, which had been implemented over the past five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent lamps by eco-friendly lamps, and another for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government's scientific advisor on climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than we think.
For example, he explained, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution in contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make it another similar by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN explained that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientes was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is right.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order of Sonora Commission."
"Mr Espino has the right to address the National Council's Order Commission, if necessary, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he informed that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections of the next 4 and 5 December where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and has achieved its objective," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council will no doubt be able to elect the best leader that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the succession "to the person determined by the council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five".
He predicted that the party's revival in the July 4 elections would be reflected on the next fight, even though "it's not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now it's about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task".
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have made ourselves "many hopes for them, and I am sure Gabino will live up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the priists to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they are beginning to defend them; that they are getting out of 'the cabinet'," he said.
He said that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Hearing, because in the country there is no gag, let alone censorship.
Obama promotes law on Twitter for undocumented students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call you senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitted the US president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call you senators and ask them to approve this legislation," said Twitté Obama.
His short message maintains a cybernetic link with a broader document that asks the public to immediately contact senators, as voting on legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we're hoping for soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he says.
The message was leaked after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding extended.
Such a blockage, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockage of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confidant that once the tax problem is solved one can set a sting for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be resolved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get a deal at some point in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic majority leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would be asking for a "debate closing vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Law would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they stayed in that country for the last five years and they were accepted by a higher education institution or the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the support of a large number of Republicans, at times when the project's partisan organizations are actively lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Between the most courted Republicans there are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of office su Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they weren't going to support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his posture so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the larger obstacles of the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature we put the finger on the wound
The second stage of the Language Pleasures was a walk in which participants displayed the storytelling
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what do we hope of me?", asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and which this time used the subtitle of his question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound "... puts us in embarrassment", the Argentine writer gently threw to the public, most of the young, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio which Shultz defined after as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "plain", she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only leads in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "on the wound I could only know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very connected between them.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a ravishing narrative which he called "Eloge à l'invention", where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magic realism, he speaks of a famous witch who touched clouds, brought back people who had gone far or repaired virtues that a damsel had lost, a narration that veers to then speak America, the great news that had from the beginning had her own chroniclers and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the narrations of the conquering capitans.
"Cervants who invented us all (the writers) mocked the false witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that even lacked modesty".
Nevertheless, he pointed out, "crazy and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with lies, we no longer know what part of narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is actually called the 'Tradition of Cervantes'.
"It's thanks to his legacy that we're telling the story".
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with his round table Le owes on the wound.
The Cuban-Portuguese country has put its own on the great plague of the social violence that its country is going through - and Latin America is sharing - produces disputes over trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think good literature, good poetry good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "it must on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every assertion there is a small no and behind every negation there is a small yes".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuancer means many times putting the finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very convenient thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance and disturbing also the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting to regain the sense of writing.
Romano hunting his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, which find a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals, he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series, even though so far he has not put in the mile and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentinian eventually consoled himself with the sub-champion medal, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santist strategist came to his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opener Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later in the Closing 2003 he also came to the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again, as his team made an equal 2-2 match against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty series he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and eventually three of his players missed by 11 metres and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to break away from the malefic so that he can celebrate for the first time a title, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented the helmsman when asked what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, from which he assures that he learned a lot, "the only lesson we can remember is that until the referee whistles the final, we can't celebrate, we're prepared in the line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run and I think that's a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never seek to arrive at the series of penalties, we try to finish within the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare ourselves, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anxiety of holding the title in our hands, hands it has escaped us, it has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we no longer arrive in this situation".
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must go to the Service Centres for Visa Applicants prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to report to the Service Centres for Visa Applicants (CSA) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take biometric information from the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for aspirants, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for processing the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visa applications (this includes visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for visas for traders and investors.
Individuals wishing to renew their visas will not be required to attend an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only report to the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be made in the CSA, applicants who wish to have a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there for less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.
For further information on the new visa application procedure, visit the following page: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA to announce discovery of alien life
The United States Space Agency cited the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Administration of Aeronautics and Space (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow, at 13:00 hours at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When quoted from the press, NASA assured that it would present who will have an impact on the search for alien life", which prompted speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that we thought were uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if its living conditions are improved.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, this proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from that we know".
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the discoveries in tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
The conference will include the geobiology Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest satellite), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of the Congress, we make possible the arrival of 'bipartism', we denounce.
The 60th had just settled in Congress when an opposing bloc, led by PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, appeared, who declared himself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tonent' against the reform of the Organic Law, for it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, "bipartism" is initiated because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four deputies, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Executive Board chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would talk to representatives of PAN and PRI to modify the scheme based on political will and if they do not have it, they would again be enslaved by both parties and in this way will end the opposing coalition.
"Until now (the opposing coalition), that's what I'm looking at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there is an eternal bipartism in Congress".
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergence abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that now the Congress has turned into a 'goal' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two".
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave by cupular agreements out of 5 which will probably be 9 Members, now to the five we are seen, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to look for a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they have made, that they have decided, we are out and we do not agree with this reform".
$200 million more for "the supplier"
Mazatlán Town Hall pays another check to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque of about 200 miles pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Town Hall.
With this, the amount paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipe, the latter cheque number 9258447 was issued the past 16 November for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in concept of "liquidation of accounts suppliers".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, who was observed by the State Superior Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued to Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, two on 15 October, on 19 October, on 29 October and the latter on 16 November.
Even though the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after 25 July Noroeste had published a review of the cheques that the Town Hall issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the meantime March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipe paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be treated
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Zona Dorada Traders Association, recalled that they have repeatedly asked for the image of the destination to be neat and new activities to replace others that tourists find bad.
He said the bad condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected as tourists come there to walk and they see the mess and avoid the nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what closing a business means one day and they don't know the fortune we lose, elsewhere they didn't do the work for so long and without proper planning".
Hotelier José Ramón Manguard Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the Town Hall.
"The muncipee will have to assume his responsibility and avoid that it goes through again, how to do it, so through preventive maintenance and only do the corrective," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the Town Hall must change its strategy to maintain the city well".
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it only depends on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the attention they need, and this kind of fact points to something that is well known to all, the interview is necessary".
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Secretary of Tourist Promotion, said the recovery of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, as they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Happily Mazatlán offers many historic and cultural sites and places that should be ordered first, clean and put us online to make them attractive so they can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination".
IP asks Congress for results
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs take the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations that confront each other.
The business sector of Mazatlán calls for a decent and free labor legislature between the parties and the government executive, because Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 MPs from PRI, 13 from PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives was installed.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress is a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs take the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations that confront each other.
"We hope that the MPs really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to watch over their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions".
That is why I ask them to certify the commitment to build the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making progress.
"We will ensure that they do a dignified and especially committed job with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa have given them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Mangart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in seeking the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and in a way that will stimulate the generation of workstations".
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a smaller budget and it is incongruent as an important economic activity and generating foreign exchange and investment and which rivals directly with the agro-industry".
Aside from the need to classify resources to detonating tourism projects that help to secure the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for king mage
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi Kings will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, for their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a kid.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear the toys and clothing they so desire.
The family lives in a humble home in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day by day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell tangerines and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plèbes' for sale on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, ten-year-old José Alfredo has long been aspiring to have a 'monster truck' and for his 8-month-old little brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests waistwear for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I told him 'we'll see, my son', because he was very dear', remembers Cayetana with sadness.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be the ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, wears size 12; Isaías, 10 years old, wears size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, wears size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make reality the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the On Searche Roi Mage campaign, giving a toy or money to the reception of Noroeste.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
Searches were carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in locations that were reported to have been used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, silver and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for the Sûreté du Québec.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two Sherbrooke men.
The arrested persons were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches were carried out following a long-term investigation, which lasted for almost a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec regional investigation module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Board took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives' bill, which, according to the government, should solve the problem of ships loaded with illegal migrants, will obviously be defeated as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, as he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the bill as proposed, which would allow for the detention of up to one year of any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe also indicated that he could not support the bill because he was attacking the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," said Mr Duceppe.
The NDP's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has sideways rejected criticism that her party is not firm enough on illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree that we should take action against smugglers and that is what we are doing through another bill, the C-35," said Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," said Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are telling MPs massively that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections should it be rejected.
However, a Conservative told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that each member who opposes would then explain to his or her constituents.
The new unity is not unanimous.
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, maintains that this idea is not of yesterday's date: Quebec City would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this matter as early as last January.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It didn't take much more for Pequist critic Stéphane Bergeron to describe this announcement as "a rabbit out of a hat" and a "do-it-yourself solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who feared that political power would have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You'll see the result when we announce it, he just says."
"We're aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr. Charest persists in not wanting to set up this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the École nationale d'administration publique.
To break this impasse, he suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We need to be able to expand the Auditor General's mandate," he says.
He also felt that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government boxes.
Quebec City would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better accommodate this type of crime.
This request would come from the Prosecutor of Operation Hammer, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some of the amendments related to this issue.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit biker groups, even if the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several rivers remain under high monitoring due to heavy rainfall that has occurred in several parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another slip would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road broke down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, which was 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimetres of rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the regions.
The areas north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
Because this precipitation must be added to the snowmelt already accumulated in some areas, there is concern that several streams may overflow.
Flood warnings were issued on Wednesday evening by the Quebec Civil Safety Agency for the Ouareau and the Bassin rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, at Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and of the Oak, in Lotbinière, were subject to flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière area, heavy precipitation has caused the overflow of some lakes, at Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In the Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes resulted in the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on alert and closely monitors the situation," said Annik Bouchard, Security Advisor.
The Centre de prévision des crues du Québec issued on Wednesday warnings of heavy floods for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, l'Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec City radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) for controversial remarks about social assistance and Haitians as well as his coarse on-air language.
The CBSC found that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some of the comments contained "incorrect information about social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and coarse language that was not suitable for broadcasts during the day".
The Commission also found that a discussion of suicide, including the broadcast of the names of two persons who committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Front commun des personnes aides sociales du Québec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the show were inaccurate.
Animators must provide solid rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, host Stéphane Dupont felt that suicide is a coward's gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes of "Dupont au midi" have addressed a sensitive issue in a fair and appropriate manner."
Therefore, no blame was held against him.
The last dispute concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then engaged in a media face-to-face that had elicited many reactions.
The host of CHOI said that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because it could not be known with certainty that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already purged my three-day suspension on that."
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," said the host.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which must, among other things, announce these decisions once during prime time within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special route.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs on the world's tatamis and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for battles all over the place, because for those who don't like playing on the ground in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, he who works as a security guard and as a clerk for UPS has just issued bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"Currently, I'm getting ready to go to China for the San Shu World Cup."
"The fighters who finished among the top four at the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament fifth, while I came third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've made progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline native to China where punches and kicks, as well as projections on the ground, are allowed.
The duels take place originally on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous Pugilist from this form of combat is the Vietnamese-born American Cung Le, well-known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event to remember in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the most successful and prestigious in China," said the friendly fellow."
"It's kind of the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (Thailand's largest stadium)."
"It's been a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"Semifinal winners compete in their category finals".
"Then the winners of each category face each other in order to crown only one champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without invitations to tender
Hydro-Québec has awarded $450 million in direct contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium made up of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor firms obtained the largest amount, that of project management, for a sum of $295 million without invitation to tender.
This consortium called Energy Stewardship was formed in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's choice to entrust the private sector with the responsibility of managing this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energy Stewardship consortium drafted the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing higher prices.
"This is the new way of collusion and cutting down on competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing this secretly, now do it openly," said Pequist MP Sylvain Simard yesterday at a press conference.
Earlier this morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he had difficulty seeing how public interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there had been collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she pestered, arguing that the PQ had been "unhonest" and had "missed rigor".
She said that "it would be the least thing" that the PQ apologized.
The consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond to a competitive bidding process for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The project is in progress and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition acting; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week by Le Devoir, the consortium formula in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated in the government.
A quick overview of Quebec's business register makes it possible to count more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and the same legal person, Dessau.
With respect to the Energy Stewardship Consortium, Minister Normandeau noted that "the territory of James Bay has been responding to specific labour force dynamics and Hydro-Québec has been responding to them in a particular way since the 1970s."
Major Eastmain Project boss Réal Laporte of the James Bay Energy Corporation (JSBC) provided an explanation that sparked concern that the project's stewardship contract was awarded on a voluntary basis.
"If you go on tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say: we're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal with a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that's important, it's the skill of people," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Energy Stewardship consortium is part of a long list of contracts over $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin took 22 contracts, Génivar got 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention his participation in Energy Stewardship.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 contract with Energy Stewardship.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau dropped that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "finance it", before stating that it was rather its leaders.
Responsible Consumption Barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
Quebec consumers have very little confidence in the players involved in sustainable development, but also in fair brands and greening certifications to guide their choices.
Worse, even if it bathes in a media world where the messages in favour of more responsible consumption are growing, it deplores a lack of credible information, which it even describes as a brake on its commitment, says the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the companies' green advertising, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatoire de la consommation responsable at Sherbrooke University.
Another observation is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands showing themselves to be eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, politicians' speeches on this topic are taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this segment of consumption currently driven by nearly one-third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and dubiousness of the information would calm the ardours of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
On the other hand, one third of Quebecers say they are as suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services that are being put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and, above all, changed the brand of one or more products to meet their conviction.
At 61%, they also encouraged purchases from local merchants and favoured the purchase of food products grown in their area, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible - the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - the Homo consumer of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological awareness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, just 28% of Quebecers reported using public transit or advocating carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this vast behavioural survey, which has just taken its first shot.
State loan for eXcentris buyback
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to make a financial commitment to the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but up to a loan only.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, which hoped for a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard by giving him his full cinephilic vocation, did not get what they were demanding.
The government agrees to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would be lower than initial expectations, which could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of sources from the state's compendials.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who is leading the eXcentris case.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the cabinet's counter-proposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until 31 December to respond.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the gift of the State must really be ruled out.
Recall that the Association des propriétés de cinémas et de cinéparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the state to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the ministère de la Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it has not done for other cinemas.
On the contrary, however, a number of stakeholders in the community were calling for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of ceans, for ten years carried the author's cinema to his premises of the complex after financing himself its construction, which could justify a derogation on the part of the Treasury Board.
The lack of theatres for independent films is crying out in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
The Société Angus and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private fundraising campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the acquisition wheel.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, has continued to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three theatres on February 27 by screening Xavier Beauvois's beautiful film Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals that are made to them.
The veil lifted on a complex Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks are raising the veil on what the United States considers to be the Canadian inferiority complex to the Americans, but they are thus betraying the Americans' sense of superiority to Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian elector does not have Canada-U.S. relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government pass its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which took place in the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the middle of a federal election campaign, tells how far the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great astonishment of the U.S. Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provided some explanations for this situation.
"A complex of almost inherent Canadian inferiority may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about the internal issues of everyday life rather than to bring this election to the United States (as in the free trade campaign of 1988)," he wrote.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it".
The Ambassador understands this deafening "silence" all the less because the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically," he believes, "the ability of a candidate, a party and even more a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote."
The other expression of this sense of importance is the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival in the early February vote of confidence on the federal budget, by which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade due to a 30-$40 billion stimulus plan," Breese writes.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas in order to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series broadcast to CBC are returning from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the shows Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which we see little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or abductions for CIA muscle interrogations.
Another cable relates that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he handed over a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"Secretary agreed to review file".
Let's finally note that spirits are warming up about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered".
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
The United Nations proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs), which is almost one third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in line with the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to have adopted in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode bulbs (LED or "LED" in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHGs emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase aggregate GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract 5 Gt from this balance sheet in order to stabilize by 2020 the rise of the climate to 2 degrees centigrades in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates as heat and the rest, or 5%, produces light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy need is reduced by twice again.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, like those launched by manufacturer Philips this week - this company participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These all new bulbs can also work with rheostates in addition to emitting very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have posted reserves for compact fluorescent light bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place guidelines.
But, says the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact bulb, but rather coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants, which would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire looks forward to the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the deadlines had expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," said a spokesman for the UN leader.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission passed the deadline of Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's election.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the President of the CIS had said on television that the commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied on Wednesday in the world for the CIS to finally announce the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But Camp Gbagbo is counting on the constitutional council cancelling "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian president, claimed that the intimidation of voters by the FN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's complaints were upheld by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any connection with the ex-rebels, found "unacceptable" the delay in announcing the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that filing a complaint before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the election commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, on Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that had been split in two for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the lead of the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the vote against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, which received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France in the sense of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including the overseas departments), show the seasonally adjusted data (SSCs) published on Thursday by INSEE.
The number of unemployed in metropolitan France stands at 2,631 million.
Data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the working population in metropolitan France and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over one year, the unemployment rate has risen by 0.1 percentage points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people on the labour market has further deteriorated, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, rising to 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 point over three months, +0.5 point over one year) and 25% by including the DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed under the ILO.
Seniors, for their part, experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 percentage points over three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the DOMs.
Only 25-49 year-olds enjoyed stable unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage point over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
INSEE has not published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of waste treatment companies and brother of the President PS of the Bouches-du-Rhône General Council, was indicted and imprisoned at the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with abuse of social goods, embezzlement of funds and public goods, concealment, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, says her lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wants to explain all the questions the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies."
"It is easy to sue him for a multitude of reprehensible counts, it is another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told the AFP before the hearing of his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strongman of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, insisted, through his lawyers, to pass to the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged on Wednesday night and imprisoned.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than run the dumps he had to handle.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds linked to their operation, he never knew of them, said Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director-general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was charged on Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial supervision with prohibition to meet the protagonists of the file.
"My client has been able to explain the facts that he is accused of."
"The examining magistrate has taken this into account by not depriving him of his freedom," said his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been charged and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them being placed under judicial supervision, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General of Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "traffic of influence and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Briguier, are charged with "subtracting and misappropriation of public goods by a person entrusted with a public service mission", the other for "complicity of misappropriation of public funds".
Finally Alexander Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was charged for "recel of abuse of social goods".
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently convicted in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies were used to launder money from big banditry.
The investigation is carried out in the context of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for alleged frauds in public procurement, in particular in the waste chain.
From a source close to the survey, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the waste from Aubagne as well as some cities in the urban community of Marseilles (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysée exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spying", held the public in suspense in France, alerted diplomacy, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of the diplomats of the United States.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the undersides of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on the treatment of their own "hostages" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not been matched by the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by the American justice system for trafficking in materials for the benefit of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they place under raw light the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it was nothing of the sort.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases".
The Elysée advisor for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, meet with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own forcibly detained nationals to Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "get the words "fundamental human rights", "innocent", "immediate liberation" in the media.
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more as Iranians ask you not to do it".
Because, past attempts at discussions through discreet channels, "silence will not settle anything", the Iranians are "masters in delaying maneuvers".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day she takes refuge at the French embassy) "will require the payment of a large amount of money to Iranians" (230,000 euros of bail).
And he points out that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will worsen".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but remains stranded in Iran.
Information is being disseminated: Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is being requested by the United States for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, is being released in Paris, by a judge's decision.
The American embassy, like many observers, wonders about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking down Iran's clandestine networks for the acquisition of nuclear-related equipment, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a bargain?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a further interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he said, was not only "completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There have been lively exchanges between the French Presidency and the keeper of seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot reverse the decision", he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of French intelligence services.
The Elysée advisor dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts, by means of press releases and "leaks" organized in the media, to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influent" role as a "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that manipulation is bearing fruit since several press articles echo the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
On what basis is so much "gratitude" expressed towards Mr Assad, wonders the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their praiseworthy statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what Syrians have actually done".
The paper then looks at the reasons that prompted Elysée to pour into this fiction.
The intense communication effort "aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived by many critical voices in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "show Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also "to sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least cause confusion among Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in supporting the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called "Cinderella" law that will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under the age of 16, said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the minister in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request it, the head added.
It will also make available to people who request it free software to limit the amount of time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
By November, South Korea had won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World: Fifa designates the organizing countries
In turmoil due to suspicions of corruption, the Fifa Executive Committee on Thursday designates the countries organizing the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where the struggles of influence and lobbying risk taking precedence over the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Fifa Queen Competition will take place in Europe, traditional stronghold of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
That of 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its establishment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities from the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives a measure of the economic and political stakes of a World.
Behind-the-scenes deals may therefore last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the Fifa evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the origin of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the CE (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC released a documentary featuring three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to displease the Fifa and embarrass the English officials, who have engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of government hopes to reissue the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity suffice to restore the coat of arms of England to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spain-Portugal duo is not lacking in assets with its stadiums already ready, its expertise (Global-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings of its file (stades, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and denounced an "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, with its 1994 experience, appears to be the logical favourites.
The world's leading economic power, the seat of Fifa's main sponsors, the country seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, which separately built a very beautiful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organised the event in 2002.
Another threat is the granting of the World-2026 to China, ardently desired by the Fifa, which would in fact render the Asian chances for 2022 null and void.
With Qatar, which has released the big game by offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, the Fifa would continue its expansion to new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the low TV charges paid (due to the jet lag) by European countries, the nerve of the Fifa war.
Second mandate: the obvious
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made it seem like he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation whatsoever.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they did.
One mandate at the Elysée calls for another.
So the current Head of State will be running in 2012.
But the obvious does not fit well with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
Then we have to pretend that the doubt still exists.
In one way or the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would take his decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011".
That he evokes in front of UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday night at the Elysée, the prospect of "two terms" has therefore sown a little ferbility.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were a long way off.
The president merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional review limited the number of quinquennats to two.
He was making an observation, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that he has evoked the presidential, in the tone of humour, during such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he had launched in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm thinking about the next step."
His words of the day before yesterday do not make him more candidate than the day before; they do not make him less.
If they get comments, it's for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race to apply for the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the entry into the contest of Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious, many of the PS are calling for an earlier than expected order of battle.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this," immediately and cautiously reacted the Prime Minister's entourage.
"If he thinks defeat is possible, he won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," says Alain Juppé, obviously resigned.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain government securities purchases
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the arrangements for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of many of the non-conventional monetary policy operations that are due to end at the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt is forcing, and the Frankfurt Institute of Issue will probably not be able to afford to be as peremptory as it is to worsen a situation that is more tense today on European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
It did not wish to say whether it believed that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...) ".
The day before, in Brussels, at its hearing by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more discord with his intentions, merely stating that the programme for the purchase of government securities on the secondary market was "continuing" and that "we will see what we decide" at this Thursday's meeting.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main policy rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled last week to nearly EUR 1.35 billion.
And, according to market operators' indiscretions, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that there are expectations of continued purchases (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect a significant change of course.
While lending operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited cash allocations on generous terms and for terms ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this arrangement to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine she's significantly changing her program."
"If not it would be taking the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, Commerzbank economist.
"A gradual release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," predicts Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its intervention in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these bonds in order to animate an atonous market", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It needs at all costs to replace the lack of investors in the market and to act in such a way as to prevent an upsurge in the returns paid by the most fragile states," testified a major bond manager yesterday.
If interest rates soar, the states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
Safeguarding the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government makes the round back
After a worrying beginning of the week for Italy, yesterday the situation eased slightly with the fall in ten-year bond rates.
A return to precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indescribable" and expect a "unforeseeable" weekend, which he then denied.
On Tuesday in any case, the gap with the German long rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of hedging contracts against bankruptcy risk (CDS) had flown at 263 points, resulting in a certain panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand, Gianni Letta, said he was "strongly concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the diminution of tax revenues that goes with it, putting the State at risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget currently under consideration in the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the general government deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," says Economic Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of his economy are in order and his accounts are good, as we have said for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or in the long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts required of Italy are less than those required of other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD Chief Economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would open up a period that is not conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde once again hammered it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe that we have still shown it Sunday in the day and at night, are obviously united, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although all relative, yesterday's relaxation on the rates of European government bonds brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet talk about the beginning of normalisation.
Standard & Poor's rating agency has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt rating, the most targeted target today for speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which particularly weighs on banking systems," said Exane BNP Paribas economists.
All the more so because "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it presents, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis measures.
Informal consultations between the Finance Ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are well underway.
This is also in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform extreme-eastern investors of developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, he certainly prepares the ground for them.
The first issues of EFSF securities are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an American official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The front-line countries, Portugal and Spain, for their part, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are in addition to austerity measures with closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries are eager to avoid seeking international assistance before putting in place their own budgetary adjustments and deciding on the structural reforms that are essential to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of normalising sovereign bond markets.
While in Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had first put forward the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism with a total of EUR 60 billion to date.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions got worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
Snow episodes continue to cause traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienna, were added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows slightly on the Ile-de-France.
Layers of snow ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snowy episodes are enough notable to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, Météo France warns.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several départementales were banned for heavy goods vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to gendarmes who recommend taking their vehicle only if necessary and the traffic of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday night to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked the airlines to cancel Thursday 25% of their flights on the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly due to the coming snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Greater Paris Metro: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in the Ile-de-France has been in full swing, billions have been raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion people are talking about the Grand Paris metro which the Société du Grand Paris has to build.
To start this GSP, the state has announced a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this sum will then allow the GSP to borrow a share of the financing of its double loop in the markets.
Today, we finally come to the first additions.
The amending Finance Act 2010, considered in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, the text of the bill, article 15, reads "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is quantified: "The revenue from this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a redevelopment of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, increase its product and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that cost?
Mystery.
It's not encrypted in the text.
We're far from the four billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the 4 billion euros of the capital allocation that will be mobilised by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project proceeds," says the explanatory memorandum.
At the GSP, we don't find this system shocking.
"From the moment we create revenues (both taxes, ndr), we can cover the studies over three years and then type in the 4 billion after, we explain there."
"This will be included in the budget and drawn as we go".
The GSP estimates that the $4 billion will begin to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised 4 billion are still absent subscribers, risks causing a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Avengers and spies hackers on stage
The WikiLeaks case has double value.
On the one hand, it turns out to be an apparent scandal, a scandal that only appears as a scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and prefigures a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every file made up of a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those of which Berlusconi owns), and Khadafi's sinisterly caricature profile had long been for cabaret artists to sketch.
The rule that secret files should be composed of only known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous books.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (or know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe only in what they already know, and reconfirm what they had already learned.
It's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
Same for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of limited mind) the head of the secret services (if not he could be, what do I know, editor of Libération), who retains as true only what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the week before.
Then why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since heads of states can call themselves or fly to meet at dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have turned into spy centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only out of hypocrisy that we pretend to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to place American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the state department.
So the scandal does not put the victims in so much crisis as the "bourreaux".
But come to the deep nature of what has happened.
Back in Orwell's time, we could conceive of any power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had turned out completely since, being able to control every movement by telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when we prove, as happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the opportunity to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is true, too, that all knowing about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a secret empty of secret, because it belongs to the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to remove all power from him.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury to a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, the states will no longer be able to post any reserved information - this would be like publishing it on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is useless to expect to be able to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relations be maintained in the future?
I am well aware that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine agents of the government who move discreetly in stages with uncontrollable routes, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at most, by hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept as a single copy in locked drawers: deep down, the Watergate's spy attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now moving in crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wire telegraph (telephones).
The videocassettes (analogs) had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going forward and backward and discovering all the secrets of editing, while now the CDs (digitals) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the trips it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that communications policy and techniques should revert to horse cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secret of embassies.
Now it is the embassies that ask the press for confidential information.
Climate: how France hijacks its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to look at the fulfilment of the fast-released and early financing promises made by developed countries.
And the big French tidbits are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (or €420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU released the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency exercise is valuable and appreciated: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had made €2.2 billion available in 2010, putting it on the right track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being to the detriment of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, had blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has considered 2009 as a reference year: international financing is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" for 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or to the overall level of official development assistance.
Specifically, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to meet its commitment to "new and additional" financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between grants and loans.
Again, there is no rule and each chooses its method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that 1€ lent is equivalent to 1€ given.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
While the use of loans can be justified for some profitable investments (often emission mitigation projects that rely on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a given euro... At most, it should be counted against its commitments only the cost of the loan to the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing to do with such a reasoning: it "fulfills" its commitment of €420 million by making 91.5% loans (€389.8 million) and 8.5% grants (€36.1 million) - see the EU document to verify for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1€ to meet its commitment, France only puts 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice trick!
To sum up, in its fast start financing, France is operating a double scam: on the one hand about the evolution of the action over time and on the other about the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it manages to make it believe that it is spending 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it was enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter on early funding is only a small, relatively short-term issue in relation to all climate discussions.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge UNFCCC machine.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting method for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could move forward discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently under discussion): the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans will not be avoided.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
Hope therefore rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Pesticide alert ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (ex- Movement for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the small number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought between July and September the foods generally consumed in four meals and one snack in one day by a ten-year-old child, in the supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as treats, were examined by laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as certain carcinogens as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies from several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individual chemical are not exceeded, it is clear from our survey that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is of concern," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three found to be some carcinogenic as well as nearly twenty residues that may disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, as planned by the study, shows traces of six chemicals, one of which is a fungicide, which is banned in France.
The same applies to Kenya's green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, minced steak, canned tuna, and even the baguette and chewing gum were stuffed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to warm the microwave meal was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of this "contaminant cocktails" is "probably underestimated", according to the study.
The Europe Ecology-Greens Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "face to the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
