White pawn at f3, black pawn at e6, white pawn at g4, black lady at h4 - failure and matte! This is what we call by joking in chess circles the "mad's matte".
Whites: turn on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Blacks: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, mad on b8. Whites put the opponent in zugzwang by playing the tower in a6, after which blacks have only two options: take the tower on a6 or move their madman to any other box of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, whites advance their pawn from b6 to b7 and offer failure and matte. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pawn on a7, with the same result.
