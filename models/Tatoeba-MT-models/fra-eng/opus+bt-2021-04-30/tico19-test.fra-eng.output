Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar development in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
In Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services need to prepare for a peak of COVID-19 patients requiring care, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus 2.
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild condition, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are cured.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 leads to a more severe condition requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a serious form of the disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we evaluate trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), and compare it with developments in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with that in Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 has continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the 5 March edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom (UK) with between 31 December 2019 and that date 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy only.
Obtaining the cumulative number and incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported COVID-19 cases in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as ministries of health, national and regional health authorities in different countries and WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom and to compare with the experience of Italy.
To estimate the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of reported cases in each country on 15 March 2020 at 8 a.m. with Italy's data for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Evolution of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The 14-day cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed that in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February before experiencing a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to the data from Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of 8 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Changes in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this despite the fact that countries are at different stages and there are differences in responses from national public health services, potential variations in case definitions, and differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including for catch-up testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or intensive care service are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not presented).
However, there is a need for systematic collection to complement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study carried out in 2010–11 showed a significant difference in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people in 2010–11).
Modelling scenarios for saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with risk > 90% exceedance of intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the CEPCM rapid risk assessment for COVID-19.
Given that cases have so far been grouped in some regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and that hospitals and intensive care services generally have a defined regional population, data on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be compiled at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services therefore need to prepare for a sustained community-based transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 as well as an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring care, particularly intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the recent rapid risk assessment of the ECDC, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, moving from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not allow sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented upstream.
Rapid risk assessment also identifies public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window in which each country can strengthen its monitoring efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Otherwise, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a peak of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus 2, has so far resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 people infected in China and around the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which resulted in thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissive, and affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this rapidly growing research topic.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will contribute to a better understanding and eradication of this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, on January 25, 2020, marked for all time the Chinese, who were forced to remain closed for the duration of the golden week as well as for long weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, which is why it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and quickly spread to all of China before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "public enemy number 1", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 work has been published on COVID-19, including in the fields of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020 with the virus sequence, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this emerging topic.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an outbreak that occurred in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis, and will address some outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, causing mainly about 15% of common colds 4.
However, over the course of this century, we have experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MRS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before rapidly spreading to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third coronavirus epidemic in recent history.
As presented in Fig. Fig. 1,1, outbreaks of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported to Wuhan on 31 December 2019 at the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was unveiled.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic had spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the town of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with the interruption of all its public transport.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease indicated that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with Wuhan's seafood market, considered to be the starting point for infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO called the epidemic a global health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had already spread to all of China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).
To the extent that the situation is changing rapidly, the final extent and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, provided an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but most of them in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/100,000) more than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 developed in homes, mainly in Hubei Province and on the periphery.
The average duration between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average duration between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproductive rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people had increased exponentially until 23 January 2020, coinciding with the massive displacements that took place prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥ 60), and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large, wrapped viruses containing a single strand RNA.
They can be classified into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, the coronaviruses known to infect humans belonging to the alpha and beta genera.
The envelope's Spike glycoprotein (S) binds to the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) and to the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cellular receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins form vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity between 10 sequenced samples taken from the site of origin of the epidemic, the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than to MRS-CoV.
Using transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium of the respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 was identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a lower infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domains or patterns.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou et al. presented the cryo-ME structure of the complete human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for coronavirus recognition and infection.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for screening drugs to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were found to be from bats and were transmitted to humans via civettes and camelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-like coronaviruses from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission is still to be elucidated.
Ji et al. hypothesized that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which would imply homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study conducted by researchers in Guangzhou, China, pangolin - a mammal with a long snout feeding on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology between a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a gap of 1% between two genomes is a significant difference, so conclusive results should be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MRS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may very well have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be susceptible to ultraviolet radiation and to a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MRS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through molecular motif recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, toll receptors (TLRs), NOD receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV's N protein can allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defence.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly remove infected cells.
Help T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defense cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with complements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case scenario, multi-visceral failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by home onset, is more likely to affect elderly people with co-morbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed an average incubation period of 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded that there was an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a population of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the actual duration of quarantine based on the most precise incubation period possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea and/or hypoxaemia one week after the onset of the disease.
For serious cases, patients rapidly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest X-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus to allow for early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients required ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of a family and an outbreak following transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with a higher lethality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in ESMR patients.
For SARS, it was found that the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%), and sore throat (13%-25%), and ventilatory assistance was required for approximately 14%-20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, for 66,576 globally confirmed cases.
In comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 reached 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality, and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MRS-CoV, and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to propagate than MRS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
As a result, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than it was for the MRS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or in a gathering or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients often travelled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or were in contact with infected individuals or patients within two weeks of onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals may be carriers of the virus without exhibiting symptoms for more than two weeks and that recovered patients may be re-carriers of the virus, underlining the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count < 4 × 109/L and lymphocyte count < 1 × 109/L, as well as high aspartate aminotransferase and viraemia levels were identified in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the level of D-dimer, a degradation product of fibrin present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Chest X-ray abnormalities occur in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral uneven shadows or frosted glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARD).
In case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes results in a decrease in surfactant levels and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most worrying chest exams often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed desquamation of pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and the presence of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, coinciding with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA and similar to that of SARS and MRS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer solely based on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation was observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
For example, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for using the SHERLOCK technique based on CRISPR technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which identifies synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre sample) using a reactive strip in less than an hour, without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality if its use on clinical specimens is successful.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only offer supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MRS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine as well as psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been proposed for treatment.
All pharmaceutical companies are working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (EMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat critical heart or respiratory deficiencies.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolytic balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, and the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been shown that an excessive reaction of the immune system results in cytokinetic shock in SARS and MRS patients.
Cytokinetic shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a range of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shocks, especially in serious cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, were used to treat cytokin shock.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine shock include modulation of immune response by T cells, blockage of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF cytokines, JAK inhibition, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 reporting suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressant agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, taking high-dose steroids did not have any beneficial effects on severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they would lead to serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, thus significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, careful use of short cycles of low to moderate dose corticosteroids has been recommended for patients with severe form of COVID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, was effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, reddesivir also demonstrated a potential inhibition of other single-strand RNA viruses, including MRS and SARS.
Based on these findings, Gilead transmitted the compound to China to allow a number of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects may occur as a result of combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully controlled.
Plasma of re-established patients and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have cured a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is an ancestral practice.
Indeed, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies to the pathogen.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize molecules unique in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Plasma was thus extracted from the blood of a group of patients who cured COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, in combination with decreased inflammation, reduced viral load, and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary in order to propose this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
Furthermore, in view of the therapeutic effects, certain disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat seriously ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and effective to isolate B-cells from recovered patients and to identify genetic codes encoding relevant antibodies or to seek effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would allow rapid increase in antibody production.
MTC has been used for millennia in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components into a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis, based on TCM theories.
Most of the effective components remain little or no known, as it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of a specific effective treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or remission of a severe form of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest recovery rates for COVID-19 were observed in provinces in China that used TCM for 87% of their patients, including Gansu Province (63.7%), Ningxia Region (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used only 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a rather rough comparison since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study comparing treatment using Western medicine (MO) only and combined treatment combining MO and MTC.
It appeared that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time to resolve symptoms, and the duration of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only.
More impressively, the rate of worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% vs. 46.2%); similarly, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM remains to be clarified through larger scale controlled trials and more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally feel serious concern about this highly contagious and fatal disease, and those in quarantine also experience a sense of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatments, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, may lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
Early in the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidity was reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, acute confounding, and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact research and quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to a degree of guilt for patients regarding the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigmatization of their family and friends.
For example, mental health care must be provided to patients with COVID-19, to individuals identified as probable cases, to people in contact with these populations, and to any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal reservoirs and infected human beings to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein vaccines to produce potent neutralizing antibodies in the long term and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Attenuated live vaccines were evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in the elderly and in models subjected to lethal provocation and their protection from infection with zoonotic viruses remains to be determined, as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS died 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of ESRM continue to occur in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using the inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles, and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective in order to control the current epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the large amount of time (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and dynamic changes in coronaviruses.
To the extent that this is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a prognosis model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies to date, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 are as follows (Table 33):
Age: Age was the primary factor in the prognosis of SARS, and this also appears to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily affects individuals aged 30 to 65 years, with 47.7% over 50 years of age, according to a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 years vs. 51 years), suggesting age as a prognosis factor for COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and Complications: patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to cholangiocytes positive for ACE2, which can lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and the presence of underlying health problems are highly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage; it has been advanced as a potential prognosis factor for disease, response to treatment, and healing.
The correlation between CRP and severity and the prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also contribute to the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, including the heart and liver, and are released in case of tissue damage.
They are therefore traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major Clinical Symptoms: thoracic radiography results and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with other elements for the determination of the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as supplemental treatment for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since the use of high-dose corticosteroids has been widely used in serious SARS cases, many survivors have experienced avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, administration of steroids to COVID-19 patients should be limited to a low dose and short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a large number of cases of exceptional stress, with patients often experiencing long quarantine periods, extreme uncertainty, and the death of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and has little or no symptoms in the first phase of infection, such as coronaviruses that cause common colds.
As a result, newly infected individuals or incubated individuals can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly impedes the control of the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV was considered to be transmitted by patients with severe illness, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 outbreak is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than SARS.
Considerable efforts are being made in China, including the containment of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of almost the entire population to halt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as on other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the phase of decline will last 3-4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believe that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not die in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in mean nasal cornet and throat samples from recovered patients 2 weeks after leaving the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode like influenza.
However, encouraging signs have been observed in China with the gradual reduction of new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
It is anticipated that the Ebola virus would result in up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally put under control.
It is possible, as in the case of SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infectivity and eventually extinguishes or evolves into a less pathogenic virus co-existing with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 outbreak with SARS and MRS is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by cough or sneezing, and possibly also by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in stools, revealing a new possibility of fecooral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
Precautionary measures should therefore be taken to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of patients, and even any person likely to be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible line of defence to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 (1860) breathing masks helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition to surfaces, where they could be transmitted to others.
However, only the N95 (1860) masks provide protection against the inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions capable of fully penetrating; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the SARS-CoV in size, since both are about 85 nm long.
Since the particles manage to pass through five stacked surgical masks, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 (1860s) masks and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care professionals must wear tailored insulation blouses to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by eye contact.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor turned out to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have penetrated his body by eye contact due to inflammation.
Therefore, health care professionals should also wear transparent visors or eyeglasses in contact with patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected regions, it is strongly recommended to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to remain confined to the maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected individuals.
It is advisable to keep a distance of one metre with the sick.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China on high alert after the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the population by claiming that the new virus was not contagious, that it had limited human-to-human transmissibility, and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a notable slackening, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
China's disease control agencies must learn from it and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, as each word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or official agencies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages rather than trying to reassure the population; and (4) carry out more targeted and relevant exercises in order to raise public awareness about epidemic diseases, but also to test and regularly improve the response system of society.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing this report, it has spread to all of China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Since this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also similar to those of SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic gives rise to an impression of déjà-vu.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which need to be considered in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women; the severity and mortality rate are also higher among older people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by patients with severe illness, making it much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This partly explains why the SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than the SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests may be negative for some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may be positive for the virus again.
This significantly increases the risk of spread.
Despite rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 originates from bats.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the virus from the initial host, e.g. bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively stop transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how does the virus penetrate exactly into respiratory cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing ACE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during human-to-human transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or resurface regularly like influenza?
It is essential, although it may take time, to get answers to all of these and many other questions.
However, no matter how much it costs, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as quickly as possible in order to resume the normal course of our lives.
Generally, the incubation period for these two viruses is less than one week, followed by approximately 2 weeks of disease.
Only rare immunocompromised patients experienced severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
Not counting the supertransmitters, it was estimated that each case could produce approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of between 4 and 7 days, with peak viral load occurring on day 10 of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, skewed liver function tests, and high creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory tests for SARS suspicion.
Diffuse alveolar lesions, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20 to 30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokinetic shock, which may be fatal especially in immunocompromised patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolite is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal collection of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present throughout the world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized due to pneumonia and bronchiolite in Hong Kong.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present globally, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of ESRM are similar to those of SARS and are characterized by evolutionary acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MRS have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MRS compared to HCov pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most fatal viruses known in humans.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MRS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCovs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCovs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms lies between SARS-CoV and the four community HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCovs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and long-term spread after transmission to humans, will influence the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four community HCoVs causing moderate symptoms have adapted well to man.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in a proportion sufficient to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restriction factors.
With this in mind, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the greater the number of people infected, the more likely it is that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by about 40 or other measures to control infections.
For many years, the four community acquired coVs have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MRS-CoV have not adapted well to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community acquired HCovs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community acquired HCov and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MRS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among them without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of HCoV.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of an HCoV if it houses a close ascender sharing a high homology at the nucleotide sequence.
The virus of origin has often adapted well and is non-pathogenic to its host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts the HCoV on a continuous and long-term basis.
On the other hand, HCoV can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, since 80 % of the animals in the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate amplifier hosts cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally estimated that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
This is why bats cannot be the intermediate reservoir host of the MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are HIV-positive with specific antibodies neutralizing MERS-CoV, as are camels from the Middle East found in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only by the respiratory tract, but also by the faecal tract, which is also the main route of excretion of bats.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less than that between the beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from the pangolin.
Recombination is a widespread factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCovs, zoonotic origins of HCov-229E, HCov-OC43, HCov-NL63, and HCov-HKU1 were also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could be derived from bat CoV, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids were also suspected to be intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic cattle around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Bat alpha-CoV near HCoV-229E has been found.
First, unlike alpacas, men may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Next, bat-like alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are numerous and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpaca-like alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogens, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to man.
Alternatively, while bat alpha-CoVs serve as the genetic reservoir of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaria could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the interspecies transmission of bats to dromedaries and dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV found in bats is known through its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedaries for decades.
It has adapted well in these camels which have passed from intermediate host to stable reservoir hosts.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats via depecing or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through depecing and eating game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred within a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single-strand RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoV could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per site per year, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to new hosts.
Nevertheless, the mutation rates of CoVs are about one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when coVs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high rate of mutation, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutation is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of human adaptation.
It can be assumed that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to the SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to the dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to render SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals ineffective in the short term.
Third, coVs change randomly and frequently when RNA is replicated using a unique "copy-choice" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for coV observed in animals, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
Beyond these three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to man.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
An electron cryomicroscopy study indicates a 10 to 20-fold affinity of this bond compared to that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetyl sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and natural host reservoirs of HCoV, such as bats, dromedaries, and rodents, could be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to square one
The diversity of bat CoVs offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCovs.
In this sense, bat CoVs are genetic reserves of HCoVs.
Of the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, as bat viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated but coding divergent ORF8 proteins.
This suppression splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV outbreak has experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, resulting in a lag in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that bats had adapted well to CoV from an anatomically and physiologically point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect exoribonuclease "rereading", which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no accident that three new HCovs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
It is here that the secrets of observation of asymptomatic carriers and what causes cases of severe infection in humans lie.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung lesions.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of dissociating the immune response may have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, administration of interferon type I at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasoma is defective in bats.
Based on this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasoma with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV was discovered, there is also a bat coV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-CoV remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs returned to the ramp due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The cultivation of wildlife consumption in some areas of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They stay in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity for contagion arises.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from ecological niches of natural zoonoses reservoirs.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a real intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Whether bat, pangolin, or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or near-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Respiratory diseases such as flu or colds can be contracted, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that may be harmful or cause disease.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate at home deliveries.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as hand washing with soap.
Pneumonia, one of the major IRAs, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, with nearly 1.8 million deaths per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common in health care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (OCD).
Deworming twice a year, combined with daily washing of the hands with soap and daily brushing of the teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser since lipids and proteins, which are organic matter in the soil, are difficult to soluble in water.
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can be used to target organisms resistant to antibiotics in the wild.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the surfactant and protective agent of the skin, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent disease and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to remove natural oils carrying dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of lukewarm water does not contribute to reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a humidant such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively remove germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, SRV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand disinfectant or hydroalcoholic solution must be used to wet well or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid elimination activity from microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have no water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may cause skin dryness if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hives or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
In spite of their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate organic matter on the hands, but only disinfect it.
This is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand disinfectants depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas that use benzalkonium chloride have had a long-term and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not appear to make any difference).
Foam a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse abundantly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant pool of water can result in recontamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean or open towel.
Wet and wet hands are more easily recontaminated.The areas most often forgotten are the thumb, wrist, and spaces between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and chipped nail polish can house microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many cost-effective alternatives to hand-washing when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, pouring water from a suspended and drilled can or gourd and/or using ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are options to save water, such as "tippy taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging pitcher using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soapbread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is to debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
After washing and drying hands with hot air hand dryers, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the finger pulp and by 254 % on the palms.
Drying with air-jet hand dryers resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
Following the drying of the hands, the following variations in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during movement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the faucet (and open the exit door if necessary).
The goal of hand washing in health care structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewels must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
During rinsing, water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With respect to the control of staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were achieved during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
For example, in most of rural Africa, it is rare to find hand-washing faucets near private or public toilets, despite the existence of cost-effective options to build hand-washing stations.
However, low levels of hand washing may also be due to stubborn habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to the final three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of campaigns to promote hand hygiene in order to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that aims to foment changes in behaviour.Following the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating hand washing.
However, one review suggests that the promotion of soap-based hand washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetid odors called miasmes.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in toilets in office buildings and airports.
The phrase "handwashing" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be an accomplice to something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other "purification" compensatory measures, such as volunteerism.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.

'Cause it's the flu season.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in virus genomes, which are most likely a result of selection pressures, particularly by the host immune system.
An example is the loss of complete ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to a deletion of two nucleotides.
While an ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, resulting in a lag in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that bats had adapted well to CoV from an anatomically and physiologically point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low rate of expression of molecules of the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (RROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect exoribonuclease "rereading", which would create selective pressure and give rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no accident that three new HCovs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
It is here that the secrets of observation of asymptomatic carriers and what causes cases of severe infection in humans lie.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung lesions.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of dissociating the immune response may have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, administration of interferon type I at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasoma is defective in bats.
Based on this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasoma with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general pattern by which the SARS-CoV and the MRS-CoV emerged.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV was discovered, there is also a bat coV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civettes and other animals on the market have been found to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses, no immediate intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts have been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoV remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 was designed by humans, whether voluntarily or accidentally.
CoVs returned to the ramp due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has greatly altered our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HCoVs to humans.
Numerous evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MRS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are from bats and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Because SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and civettes on the market, the closure of fresh product markets and the slaughter of civettes on the market could have effectively ended the SARS outbreak.
Based on the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from fresh product markets to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of many beta-CoV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, if so, how this transmission occurs, will remain to be determined in subsequent studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
There are plenty of opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or lethal CoVs in humans in the future.
The cultivation of wildlife consumption in some areas of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In response to the devastation caused by SARS, ESRM and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They stay in their own natural reservoirs until an opportunity for contagion arises.
Although bats have many characteristics favourable to virus spread, the likelihood of humans being in contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are sensitized to the need to stay away.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from ecological niches of natural zoonoses reservoirs.
Not all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are yet known.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a real intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether bat, pangolin, or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or near-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Future research in this area will clarify the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update of the criteria for the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team released a Quick Recommendation Directive for the Diagnosis and Treatment of the New 2019 Coronavirus Infection (2019-nCoV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to fight this pandemic globally.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge progress gradually based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "suspect case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak that now officially bears the name of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO called COVID-19 a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge progress slowly based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) saw a total of seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which were substantially modified.
As our directive received a comment from Zhou et al., they presented a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We approve of their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (test 7) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspect case must combine one of the features of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological priors:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and neighbouring areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a cluster of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in a reduced area such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) respiratory fever and/or symptoms; (2) imaging with characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte counts from the onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the suspect case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the whole viral genome with strong homogeneity with new known coronaviruses; (3) positive serological test for the IgM and IgG antibody of SARS-CoV-2; or modification of the specific IgG antibody of SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive or increase in titre ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to that of the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or in blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic blood screening was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continued work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and have contributed to the addition of the positive result of the specific antibody to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of caution with regard to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
As a result, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified individuals who do not have clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The evaluation system must also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope for the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspected" and "confirmed" cases, we suggest that they follow and comply with the most recent guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in a timely manner to provide assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new COVID-19 deaths, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths in a single day.
As a result, the country has a single day record of virus-related mortality.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of registered infected people included 114 active cases and 33 cured people, who remained confined to home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transportation began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transportation of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still permitted.
By March 19, these three people had recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's containment until May 1.
The Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the state of national emergency by 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Epidemics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially life-threatening an infection with HCoV could be.
Most HCoVs come from bats in which they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate tank hosts of some HCoV are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of coV-host interactions in animals could also provide a better understanding of coV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV). Beta-CoV contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of a genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and limiting factors of crossing the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, intermediate and amplifier host(s), with important implications for the prevention of future contagions.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCovs have been identified.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated in the respiratory tract from patients with upper respiratory infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow in WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the classical cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough observed in 10 to 20% of cases.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are present around the world and appear to be transmitted mainly in winter, in temperate countries.
Stores in Australia reduce limit quantities of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their toilet paper purchase restrictions to two and one package per purchase in all stores nationally, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits have been posted in the form of messages to the caisses and on the channels' Facebook pages.
Buyers apparently gathered reserves out of fear of COVID-19 and the need to contain themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted purchases of toilet paper for home deliveries to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of 8 March, stated that with the restriction of four packages in effect, "many stores are still out of stock within one hour of delivery," and called the request "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales went up "strongly" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the authorized quantity to two packages last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made available earlier stocks for a promotion scheduled for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventories, but local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult.
It anticipates an increase in production costs, as suppliers attempt to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some stores are unable to honor Wednesday's promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the distribution sector at the University of Technology of Queensland, explained that stores restock stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky item, resulting in a small quantity of stocks that, when exhausted, leave large spaces empty in shelves, reinforcing the impression of a shortage.
" Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the shelves are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, this will likely reduce panic," Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper who manufactures Sorbent paper, pointed out that they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au's article.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were organized because buyers were on leave on the long weekend of Labour Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report by ABC Australia in which they announced that they did not plan to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed Sunday night that the British Ocado online supermarket limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization calls COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the current COVID-19 epidemic (the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease) a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease, not to the danger of specific cases, WHO has indicated the need to push governments to action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries identify, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
"We are deeply concerned not only at the alarming levels of spread and severity, but also at the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He said, in remarks published by CNN in February, that "except for influenza, no other respiratory viruses have been observed since its emergence until its continued spread worldwide."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that "we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
To which he added: "and we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said in relation to the epidemic: "In short, the situation is going to get worse."
On Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an outbreak of coronavirus disease in progress since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The fatality rate is estimated at 4 per cent in China, while in the rest of the world it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to cough, keeping away from others, as well as monitoring and confining people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by introducing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic disruptions, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages compounded by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
False information about the virus has circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of Asian origin and appearance from East and South-East, as well as others from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to the decrease in travel and closures in heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the Huanan's seafood wholesale market and it is therefore believed that the virus is of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was found that the first known person with symptoms had become ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no obvious link to the subsequent outbreak of the fresh produce market.
Of the first outbreak cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.
On March 13, 2020, an unaudited report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could date back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old person in Hubei province. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases appeared to be decreasing in China but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a strong underestimation of cases, particularly those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, those aged 19 and under, representing 2.4% of the world's cases. The UK's Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population had to be infected before they could achieve effective collective immunity.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested at COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that undetected COVID-19 infections were estimated to be 86% in China until January 23, and that these unrecorded infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the base reproductive rate (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 heal.
For those who do not heal, the time between onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths were among those over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official counts of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who died who were tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual number of COVID-19 victims may be much higher, as it may not include untested deceased people - e.g., at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy show that the numbers of over-deaths during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death count.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "We know that [the number of deaths announced] is underestimated," a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of under-evaluation in the United States. Such an under-estimation often occurs during pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time since the outbreak began, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-death ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period of time.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global case-death ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the case-death ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms occurring between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms occurring after 1 February 2020).The other indicators are the lethality rate (lethality rate), which represents the percentage of diagnosed people who succumb to a disease, and the rate of infection (infection rate), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who succumb to a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have attempted to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection rate for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomised COVID-19 tests in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of the tests on lethality rate estimates.
WHO maintains that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and duration of the epidemic are uncertain and can vary by region.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said: "Uncontrolled, usually infectious epidemics stabilize and then start to recede when the disease comes to lack available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make any relevant predictions at this time about when this will happen."
Chinese government chief medical advisor Zhong Nanshan said that "this could be completed by June" if all countries manage to mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that the SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two".
According to a study at Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus—as it is transmitted very easily—will disappear completely" and that it "could turn into a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year."
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people is seriously ill and has breathing difficulties.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identify emergency symptoms such as respiratory difficulty, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakenings, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. Subsequent development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, septicaemia, septic shock, and death.
Some of the infected individuals may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm the infection, so researchers have issued recommendations that people who have had close contact with confirmed infected individuals should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
Chinese assessments of the asymptomatic ratio vary from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and onset of symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; it is more often five days. A good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost smell was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly during close contact and by fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by thin droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods, which could be projected by speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected upon expiry, including by speaking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
Postillons may land in the mouth or nose of other people next to or even be inhaled in the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and therefore cause air propagation.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
If there are concerns that it may be transmitted through stools, this risk is considered to be low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious for the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however spread may be possible before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People were tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
Only a few laboratory-confirmed reports of asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission was detected by some countries during contact search investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not yet clear how easily the disease is spreading, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives for hours or even days on the surfaces.
Precisely, the virus was detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Domestic animals and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, the UK authorities recommend washing their hands after touching animals, as after having come into contact with other surfaces that infected people may have affected.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three individuals with pneumonia related to the outbreak of Wuhan acute respiratory disease.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think he's of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, to the subgenus Sarbecovirus (line B) associated with two strains from bats.
It is 96% identical to the whole genome of another sample of bat coronavirus (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in parts of the genome sequences between viruses from pangolins and those from humans.
Comparison of the whole genome has so far revealed a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however final confirmation is made by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scanner.
A study comparing the PCR and the Wuhan scanner suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less accurate, as many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "the scanner should not be used to detect or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on 17 January.
The test uses reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be carried out on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available in a few hours or days.
Usually this test is done on a rhinopharynx sample but one can also use a throat sample. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by laboratories certified only.
Characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and CT scans of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral frosted glass opacities and a lack of pleural effusion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging is of limited precision to detect COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of thoracic scanners to PCR and demonstrated that while imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating its inclusion as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convoluted networks of artificial intelligence-based neurons have been developed to detect virus characteristics in both X-ray and scanner imaging.
Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.
It was recommended that those who had previously been infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission, and many Governments have prohibited or prevented all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus is spreading to communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been infected. Health professionals who care for someone who may be infected are advised to take the usual precautions and contact precautions, and to wear goggles. Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to identify the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments in this regard has raised issues of confidentiality, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a press release calling for limits to this kind of surveillance.
Various mobile apps were launched or offered on a voluntary basis, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's presence near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are currently circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, flushing the nose and gargarizing with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently working to develop one.
It is advisable to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after they have been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after they have sneezed, coughed, or sneezed.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant containing a volume of at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be decontaminated in several ways (in one minute of disinfectant exposure for a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71%, isopropanol at 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite at 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5%, and povidone at 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or a crèche, all rooms such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and vending machines used by sick people, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouths and noses with their bended elbows or handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing, and to discard every handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance travelled by projected postillons speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions explaining where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Wearing a mask can reduce people's propensity to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of proper hand hygiene."The use of masks has also been advocated for those caring for someone potentially affected by the disease.
WHO has recommended the use of masks for healthy people only if they face a significant risk, for example if they are caring for a patient with COVID-19, even though it recognizes that wearing the mask can help people not touch their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage their people to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical tissue masks. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks to healthy people, especially in the event of proximity (1 metre (3 feet) or less) to other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask on public transport or crowded places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage people to make face masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned public outings without a mask or other means of covering his nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the wearing of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone would protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that anyone entering a supermarket wear a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, imposed the mask on passengers on trains and intercity buses on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of an artisanal mask to those who cannot buy one.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to slow the spread of the disease by reducing contact between people.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
Social distancing methods can be applied by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowds, greeting oneself without contact and keeping a physical distance from others.
Many governments are now ordering or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum extent of gatherings recommended by U.S. government and health agencies was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system are at an increased risk of serious illness and complications. They were invited by the CDC to stay at home as far as possible in areas affected by the epidemic. In late March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify the goal of reducing physical contact by preserving social ties, whether virtual or by keeping a distance.
The use of the term “social distancing” suggested that total social isolation should be used instead of encouraging people to keep in touch with others through other means. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health to follow during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation that you only have sex with someone you live with, that you don't have the virus or that you don't have the symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for those diagnosed with positive COVID-19 and those who believe they are infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for correct isolation. Many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for whole populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most at-risk groups.
Individuals who were exposed to a patient with COVID-19 and those who recently travelled to a country or region where transmission is very important were invited to quarantine for 14 days from the time they were last exposed.
Strategies to control an epidemic are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
The containment is implemented in the early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts turn to the mitigation phase: measures are being taken to slow the spread of the disease and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Containment and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time.
Removal requires more extreme measures, in order to influence the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saves time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, masking and individual quarantine; public social distancing measures such as the closure of schools and religious offices; public efforts to encourage acceptance of and participation in such interventions; and environmental actions such as surface cleaning. More drastic measures to control the epidemic have been taken in China as the severity of the epidemic has become apparent, such as the quarantine of entire cities and a strict ban on travel.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantine, and issued alerts on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to those infected who have been quarantined, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the grabbing of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the spread of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are overwhelmed.
Suppression can be preferred, but must be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this happens first), because if not, transmission quickly rebounds when measurements are relaxed.
The long-term response to the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including existing treatment tests.
Taking medicines without a prescription for colds or drinks, as well as rest, can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO has stated that some "traditional and artisanal remedies" can soften the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental response to the epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for the redeployment of resources to different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, cancelling non-emergency interventions where possible, separating and isolating COVID-19-positive patients, and strengthening intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are various theories regarding the place of origin of the very first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are usually linked to Huanan's seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have zoonotic origin. An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Province Hospital, which informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to the Wuhan health authorities to initiate an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by Chinese New Year migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub as well as a major rail interchange.
On 20 January, China reported almost 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy by posting the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 healed.
Approximately 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted travel and put in place border controls.
National responses have included containment measures such as quarantine (also known as housekeeping, shelter or containment orders) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are subject to some form of containment in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa, and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were experiencing a form of containment, a figure of 2.6 billion two days later — about a third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the very first case would date back to 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause on 26 December, which she informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on 27 December.
Initial genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan received a warning for "spreading rumours" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "obvious evidence" of transmission between human beings.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to stem the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in human history," a sanitary cordon was announced on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, reaching a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles has been banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was later built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as congress centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government introduced new measures to stem the COVID-19 epidemic, including issuing health declarations for travellers and extending spring holidays.
The country's universities and schools have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Distance work measures have been introduced in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions have been introduced in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been modified and museums in China have been temporarily closed.
The control of population displacement has been applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (over half the population) have experienced some form of displacement restriction. After the epidemic entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. As of March 23, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted within the country within the previous five days, in this case via a traveller returning to Canton from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Prime Minister Li Keqiang stated that the spread of cases transmitted within the country was essentially blocked, and that the epidemic was controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the start of the containment. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for holders of a visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March, without specifying when this policy should end.
Persons wishing to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on 30 March, and granted monetary stimulus plans to businesses. The State Council of Affairs announced a day of mourning to begin with three minutes of silence on 4 April at 10 a.m., which coincides with Qingming's party, although the central government asked families to pay tribute online to respect physical distancing and avoid a renewal of the COVID-19 epidemic.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in cases confirmed on February 20, largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement named Jesus' Shincheonji Church.

A CNN report indicated that the combination of the large elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all people with the virus to date may have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The UK's response to the virus first appeared to be one of the most flexible among the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the UK government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measure on its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticized for its manifest lack of responsiveness and liveliness in response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement, advising against all non-essential travel and social contacts, suggesting that people work from home if possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and entertainment venues.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure facilities such as pubs and gyms must close as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month, in order to avoid unemployment linked to the crisis.

Despite this, it took time for the United States to start testing, which obscured the true extent of the epidemic at that time.
The tests were marred by defective screening kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal approval for non-government screening kits (universities, businesses and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria to qualify for a test until early March (a mandatory physician's order thereafter).
On February 27, The Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been performed in the United States.

Ma also donated medical equipment to Canada. The Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed concerns about masks and screening kits manufactured in China.
For example, Spain removed 58,000 coronavirus screening kits manufactured in China with an accuracy rate of only 30%, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese protection masks.
Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks; they were thought to have come from China, but they actually came from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in the regions of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic, where Chinese authorities had been accused of concealment that had hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government "provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the lunar New Year."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that although this was "not a WHO recommendation", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and he spoke of a "unprecedented event in the history of public health." On 30 January, following confirmation of interhuman transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the epidemic to be an international public health emergency (USPPI), the sixth USPPI since the measure was invoked in the 2009 influenza A pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said the USPPI was due to "the risk of global spread, especially for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros said: "there is no reason for unnecessary measures to interfere with international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel."
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgent need to support those countries that “do not have the systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it was about to appear”.
Tedros then said we were "as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more tomorrow."On 11 February, WHO established in a press conference that the disease was named COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate the "force of the entire United Nations system into the response".
A United Nations crisis management team has therefore been activated to coordinate the entire United Nations response, which, according to WHO, will allow them to "focus on the health response while other agencies will be able to provide expertise to manage the broader social, economic and development implications of the epidemic."
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team was activated in China to send international and WHO experts to China to support national management and assess "the severity and transmission of the disease" by organizing workshops and meetings with key national institutions and conducting field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including in urban and rural areas." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic," indicating that although it is too early to talk about pandemics, each country should nevertheless enter "preparation phase".
In response to the spread of the epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO representatives stated that the global threat assessment of coronavirus had changed from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Management Program, warned in a statement: "This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready," adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan went on to say that the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that "we accept in absolute terms that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, WHO stated that the coronavirus epidemic could be described as a pandemic.
The Director-General stated that WHO was "extremely concerned about both alarming levels of spread and severity and alarming levels of inaction." WHO faced significant criticism of its management of the pandemic, which was considered inadequate, including due to the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition urging WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts focused on respecting the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone was entitled to relief interventions and that that responsibility rested with the Government.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never serve as a justification for any discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that every individual has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, belonging to minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform that provides timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in the various countries of the world, as well as views and advice.
Between policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy and responses to the effects of containment and travel restrictions, the digital platform includes a Country Policy Tracker tool to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the challenge of coronavirus.
The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, British cabinet minister Michael Gove and the son of Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his management of the pandemic, which began in Hubei Province of China.
Several provincial administrators of the Communist Party of China (PCC) were relieved of their duties following their management of the quarantine in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political leaders to the epidemic in these areas.
Some commentators believe this action was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from popular anger over the coronavirus epidemic.
Some senior Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the primary idea that the coronavirus epidemic had begun in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories that COVID-19 had its origins in the United States or Italy.
Donald Trump's U.S. administration called the coronavirus "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", stating that in China "censorship has overnourished a virus now becoming a global pandemic", which was later called racism by some opponents and intended to "discuss attention from his administration's inability to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government outlining an apparently National Security Council-based communication scheme, the strategy quoted as follows: "Everything comes from China.
We are being asked to try to communicate this message in all possible ways, including at press conferences and television appearances."Press outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of an upsurge in propaganda to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy leader Josep Borrell warned that there was "a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and "politique of generosity."
Borrell also said that "China aggressively insists that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called on the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while a priori sending aid to the latter two countries.
The 100,000 masks Jack Ma gave to Cuba were blocked by American sanctions on 3 April.
The US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own countries.
And other mask-related conflicts have also been reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy, which was affected by coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said that "only China had responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity".
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-ranking political source" which indicated that 80 percent of Russian aid was "less or not useful to Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive of "geopolitical and diplomatic charm".
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane charged with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov said that "in offering his help to his American colleagues, [Putine] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment have gained speed, they will be able to return the same to them if necessary."
The scale of NATO's "Defender 2020" military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO's largest manoeuvre since the end of the Cold War, will be reduced.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized Exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, it is endangering not only the lives of American troops and many participating European countries, but also the lives of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about 20 infected members of parliament, as well as fifteen other former or current political figures.
Iran's President Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, stating that his country was struggling to combat the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets due to the US sanctions against Iran. The epidemic sparked calls on the United States to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal child care program, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after it announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for the indictment of Moon for mismanagement of the epidemic by the government or, on the contrary, praising his response. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could allow Governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree until further notice, to suspend parliament as well as elections and to punish anyone accused of spreading false information about the virus and crisis management by the government.
The coronavirus epidemic has been accused of several cases of supply disruptions, resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases and disruption of plant operations and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Agency has issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Several localities have also faced panic purchases that have led to the disappearance of basic necessities, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, shelves, leading to shortages.
The technology sector, in particular, has alerted to delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100fold.
This demand led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and WHO warns that this will put health professionals at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for deer to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of child milk in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the resulting high demand for food, both areas were spared from severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the stockpiling and illegal trade of essential products were a real success, thus avoiding the serious food shortages that had been foreseen in Europe and North America.
As a result of its large agricultural output, Northern Italy did not notice a significant decline, but prices could rise according to industry representatives.
The food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while members of the Chinese government released pork reserves to ensure sufficient subsistence of the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy so that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the global economy have been felt in China: according to a March 16 media report, the Chinese economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5 per cent.
As mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral epidemic has been identified as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain unstable until a clearer picture emerges on potential issues.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
The estimate by an expert from the University of Washington, St. Louis, indicated an impact of over $300 billion on the global supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is said to have "clouded" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to lower demand in China.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February following a significant increase in COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concern over the coronavirus epidemic, several U.S. stock indices including NASDAQ-100, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average posted their sharpest falls since 2008, with a Dow Jones dropping to 1,191 points, the largest decline in a day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.

Central banks are reacting faster than they did in the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the areas most affected by travel bans, the closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations against all travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe went bankrupt.
The impact on the cruise sector has reached a level never seen before.
Several ferry stations and ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the Chinese New Year.
A number of events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year festivities, and private companies also shut down independently their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many lunar New Year events were cancelled and many tourist attractions were closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, the authorities extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, requiring most workplaces not to reopen before that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has moved to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and has declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year festivities. The distribution sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in store opening hours or temporary closures.
Visits to traders in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders saw a drop of 50 to 60 per cent.
This also led to a 33-43 per cent drop in pedestrian traffic in shopping malls in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping centres around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased cleaning frequencies, the installation of thermal scanners to control customer temperature and the cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million additional people living in extreme poverty in Latin America compared to a pandemic-free situation.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large part of the approximately 300 million rural migrant workers were stranded at home in internal provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied to the government for help.
The coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Containment in India left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily wage) unemployed. The Angus Reid Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian households had experienced some type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the containment imposed in mid-March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit.
The German part-time compensation scheme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, impacting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both wage-earners and self-employed, at the global level.
Arts and cultural organizations have attempted to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists to the extent possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions around the world and to varying degrees were closed until further notice and their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intense efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the illness is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered an interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of Holy Week in Rome, which took place the last week of the period of Christian penance of Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday Masses; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online, live or television, while others propose to practice their worship in "drive-in".
Like the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome which closed its churches and chapels and St Peter's Square which emptied all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its inhabitants to sacred sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the largest interruption of the world sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sporting events were either cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 England Football Championship, the 2020 UEFA Euro, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gaming establishments around the world have closed and live poker tournaments have either been postponed or cancelled.
This has prompted many players to register online, and many online gaming sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new listings. The show world has also been hit, with several music groups having suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as those on Broadway, also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have been looking for ways to continue creating and sharing their work on the Internet to replace traditional live performances, such as live and online concerts or online "festivals" created for artists to perform, broadcast and promote their works.
Online, many Internet memes on the theme of coronavirus have spread because many prefer humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 epidemic, there has been an upsurge in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, suspicion and hostility incidents have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist sentiments expressed in different groups around the world that the Chinese deserved the virus or were receiving justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to the Chinese, both online and offline, and to the inhabitants of areas affected by the virus.
Following the spread of the epidemic to new and sensitive countries, Italians, who were the first in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19 epidemic, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens from countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea first signed petitions to ban Chinese from entering their country in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been raging on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus", a term considered by his critics to be racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from North-East India, which shares a border with China, and studying in large Indian cities are reported to have been harassed in connection with the coronavirus epidemic.
The president of the Western Bengal Unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them".
The remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which calls them "false." In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were fuelled by the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign waste" that should be "disposaled."
Many paid-access newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles available in connection with the open-access epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory screening for the 2019 Coronavirus Respiratory Disease (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the virus and to detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both population diagnosis and monitoring.
Antibody tests show how many people have contracted the disease, including people with symptoms that are too mild to report or asymptomatic people.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As at 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect reported lethality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using a variety of methods, including the nasopharyngeal swab or the sputum sample.
The results are generally available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test from pharyngeal swabs is reliable only during the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected individuals tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken from the deep respiratory tract by aspiration catheter, or sputum (sput) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charity in Berlin in January 2020 using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), and was the basis for 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK had also developed a test as of 23 January 2020.South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses, and the SARS-CoV-2-specific RdRp gene.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization from the Chinese National Medical Administration for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their RT-PCR diagnostic device in real-time for the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Resource Reagent.
Among the older versions of the test kits, one out of three genetic tests had inconclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a bottleneck of tests at the Atlanta CDC. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only then that federal and local laboratories were authorized to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 tests.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests nationally on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced. The collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was recorded by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a test for COVID-19 infection.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics was cleared by the FDA for a test that could be conducted in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing an aircraft to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an FDA EUA for a test taking about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses nucleic acid isothermic amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to step up manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, hoping that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, such as a rapid influenza test.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that "pulmonary x-rays have low diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of CT [tomography] can be conclusive even before symptoms appear."
Typical symptoms visible on TDM include bilateral multi-lobary frosted glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distribution.
A subpleural predominance, a "crazy paving" and consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to TDM in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, with several of its imaging results coinciding with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommended that "TDM should not be used for screening or as a front-line test to diagnose COVID-19."In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial screening.
Antibody production, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and as part of population surveillance.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CTLs) or by patient bedside testing (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
The automated high-speed systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of performing these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, only one peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples may be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, only one blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the agency and therefore can now distribute their antibody testing.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is much faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are generally detectable 14 days after the start of the infection.In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country were effective enough to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan under which suspicious cases can remain at home, "the emergency department will provide the patient with a sample tube", patients spit inside, return it and receive the test results later.The British NHS announced that it is conducting a pilot project to test suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk that one patient will infect others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if used.As part of the COVID-19 drive test for suspicious cases, a health care professional will take a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
The drive centres allowed South Korea to carry out one of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians stated on 2 March that it had the capacity to carry out some 12,000 tests per day in outpatient settings, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are covered by the health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-tests were available in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that at the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to and including 12/2020 and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of samples from 64 patients at a time, by pooling samples and by screening only if the combined sample proves positive.In Wuhan, an improvised 2,000-square-metre emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese: "Oil of Fire" in French) was opened on February 5, 2020 by BGI, and can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
Thanks to its 5-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modeling revealed that cases in Hubei province would have been 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capability.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Multixed free models developed by Origami Assays have been published to test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small labs without a liquid manipulator robot.
In March, shortages and insufficient quantities of reagent became a bottleneck for mass screening in the EU, the UK and the US.
This situation prompted some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes to continue screening.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now the country testing most of its per capita population for Coronavirus, and was in the process of intensifying screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were achieved through a combination of the ability to conduct drive-tests and the purchase of a population-wide broadband laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this ability to be operational outside China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula for making kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was released on January 17, 2020. The protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was only released on January 28, delaying the availability of testing in the U.S. China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of testing kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and testing recommendations of health professionals.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has contributed to reducing the spread of the new coronavirus.
Screening capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of screening programs as the best way to slow down the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has resulted in hundreds of thousands of tests being delayed in private laboratories in the United States, and supplies of swabs and chemical reagents have been depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "faults".The government then removed bureaucratic barriers to private testing.Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd., but found that the results were unreliable.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be related to the inability to collect samples or properly use the kits.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it will remove the incorrect test kits, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80 % of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic provided false results. Slovakia bought from China 1.2 million test kits that proved to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them". The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
Screening, followed by quarantine of those with positive results and tracing of those who had been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19-related death in Italy, conducted two series of tests with the entire population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Almost half of those with positive results did not show symptoms, and all cases discovered were quarantined.
With the restriction of movement in the commune, this measure completely eliminated new infections.
Thanks to aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much slower than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on 28 March, but the schools reopened on the scheduled date at the end of the holidays on 23 March.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive tracing of contacts, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive containments, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that the countries with the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower lethality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect people with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without analytical capacity and with limited COVID-19 experience in national laboratories send their first five positive and 10 negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive as % of Tests" column depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests only those admitted to hospital will have a positive value in % of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, is the cleaning of your hands to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the oro-fecal route.
Respiratory diseases such as flu or colds can be contracted, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you don't have water or soap in your hand, you can wash your hands with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after meal preparation;
before and after caring for a sick person;
after changing the diapers of a baby or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after sneezing or coughing/sneezing;
after touching an animal, feed or waste of animal origin;
Medical hand hygiene refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering drugs or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that may be harmful or cause disease.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate at home deliveries.
According to a 2013 study, improving hand hygiene practices could result in a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
The introduction of measures to promote hand washing could reduce the incidence of diarrhoea by about one third, a figure comparable to that obtained by supplying drinking water to low-income areas.
Washing your hands with soap reduces the incidence of diarrhea by 48% and is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI). This is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major IRAs, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, with nearly 1.8 million deaths per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, taking the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths due to diarrhoea by almost half and deaths due to acute respiratory infections by one quarter.
Handwashing is generally associated with other sanitary measures in the context of WASH programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common in health care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (OCD).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilet (micturation, defecation), after cleaning a baby's buttocks (or changing his diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Proper hand washing is also required to prevent the transmission of diseases, including before and after treatment of a cut or injury, after sneezing, coughing or sneezing, after touching animal waste or after handling animals and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of soap hand cleaning is low.
According to a 2015 study of 54 countries on hand hygiene, 38.7 per cent of households on average washed their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77%), and China had the lowest rate (23 per cent). There are now several methods to change behaviour and democratize the use of soap for hand washing at key times of the day. In developing countries, it is possible, among other things, to offer students to wash their hands in groups at specific times of the day so that children make this a habit.
For example, the Philipinne Ministry of Education has implemented a “Primary Health Care Program” to promote the health and education of children.
Deworming twice a year, combined with daily washing of the hands with soap and daily brushing of the teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate microorganisms on the skin, soaps or detergents should be added to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser since lipids and proteins, which are organic matter in the soil, are difficult to soluble in water.
Adequate water flow, however, facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies of transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that transfer was unlikely because the bacteria were rinsed with foam.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still says that "liquid soap vending machines are preferable."
Antibacterial soaps have been highly recommended to people who are concerned about their health.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can be used to target organisms resistant to antibiotics in the wild.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the surfactant and protective agent of the skin, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent disease and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to remove natural oils carrying dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of lukewarm water does not contribute to reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based non-aqueous hand hygiene products (commonly referred to as hydroalcoholic solutions, hand antiseptic solutions or hand disinfectants) began to become popular.
Most are formulated based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a humidant such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively remove germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, SRV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (3.5 log reduction equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of the bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.999% to 99.99% (4.5 log reduction) of the bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application.Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand disinfectant or hydroalcoholic solution must be used to wet well or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands and the interstices between the fingers and nails should be pedestalized for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or dry gel.
The fingertips should also be cleaned by rubbing them, palm to palm.The American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid elimination activity from microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have no water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may cause skin dryness if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hives or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than hand washing with water and soap.
In spite of their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate organic matter on the hands, but only disinfect it.
This is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand disinfectants depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas that use benzalkonium chloride have had a long-term and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many of the low-income populations do not have the means to buy soap, but rather use ash or land.
Ash or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends proper hand washing to prevent disease transmission, following the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not appear to make any difference).
Foam a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse abundantly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant pool of water can result in recontamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean or open towel.
Wet and wet hands are more easily recontaminated.The areas most often forgotten are the thumb, wrist, and spaces between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and chipped nail polish can house microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many cost-effective alternatives to hand-washing when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, pouring water from a suspended and drilled can or gourd and/or using ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are options to save water, such as "tippy taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging pitcher using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soapbread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is to debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper towel industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot air dryers and more modern air jet dryers.
After washing and drying hands with hot air hand dryers, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the finger pulp and by 254 % on the palms.
Drying with air-jet hand dryers resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the finger pulp and up to 77% on the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the toilet environment depending on each drying method.
The air-jet hand dryer, which blows from the air out of the appliance at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hands and apparatus and possibly contaminate other users of the toilets as well as the toilet environment in a perimeter of up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot air hand dryer allows the diffusion of microorganisms at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
Following the drying of the hands, the following variations in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during movement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing in a medical setting became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent diseases in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use led to a decrease in infection rates.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a hairbrush to remove them.
Since the germs in the water are likely to remain on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the faucet (and open the exit door if necessary).
This helps to avoid recontaminating your hands in contact with the surfaces.
The goal of hand washing in health care structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, with a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure for washing and rubbing hands in the health field.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene prepared by the United Nations are also available on the website for user feedback.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercially available devices can measure and certify hand hygiene, if compliance with the regulations is proven.
The World Health Organization defines “Five indications” for hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
After having had contact with the patient. Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap (soap "medicated" or "antimicrobial") gives the hand washing agent an action of destruction of the germs.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are widespread. To "grab" your hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a chlorhexidine or iodine-based washing product, sterile towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterile brush to rub yourself and another sterile tool to clean under your nails.
All jewels must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
During rinsing, water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
Once your hands have been washed, you should dry your hands with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical case.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With respect to the control of staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were achieved during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
Comparing hand washing with a regular soap with an antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, comparing hand cleaning with an alcohol-based solution and hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds each, the former reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the latter.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products in reducing influenza A (H1N1) virus and difficult Clostridium spores on the hands. In order to improve hand hygiene in health care facilities, it is possible to train staff in hand washing, to make more alcohol-based products available to them and to send them written and verbal reminders about this.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered to be a low-cost and essential tool for maintaining health or even proper food.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or hand washing facilities at home, at school and at the workplace, it is difficult to achieve universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in most of rural Africa, it is rare to find hand-washing faucets near private or public toilets, despite the existence of cost-effective options to build hand-washing stations.
However, low levels of hand washing may also be due to stubborn habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and raising awareness of soap-based handwashing can influence policy decisions, publicize the benefits of soap-based handwashing, and lead to long-term behavioural change among the population.
Monitoring and evaluation are necessary for this to be successful.
A systematic review of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of hand washing in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to the final three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of campaigns to promote hand hygiene in order to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that aims to foment changes in behaviour.Following the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating hand washing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the number of healthy years of life (i.e. DALY avoided).
However, one review suggests that the promotion of soap-based hand washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, particularly for vulnerable people such as mothers who had just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetid odors called miasmes.
In the 1980s, food-borne epidemics and nosocomial infections led the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The appearance of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to greater awareness in many countries of the need to wash hands with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in toilets in office buildings and airports.
The phrase "handwashing" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be an accomplice to something.
It comes from a biblical verse in Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth undertook to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary spot, symbol of her bad conscience with regard to the crimes she committed and which she prompted her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some people, having remembered or considered committing unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and to give more value to hand washing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other "purification" compensatory measures, such as volunteerism.
Some religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic hand washing, which consists of using water and not soap to wash hands, is part of hand washing rituals highlighted in many religions, including Baha'is and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual hand ablution (Nétilat Yadayim) in Judaism, basin in Christianity and wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hand washing for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.
Controls of COVID-19 hazards at the workplace
COVID-19 risk controls at the workplace refer to the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls vary depending on the workplace and tasks, based on a risk assessment of sources of exposure, severity of disease in the community, and individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs at lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other collaborators. In this case, only basic prevention measures against infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory labeling, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Jobs at medium risk of exposure include those requiring frequent or close contact with persons without suspected or known COVID-19, but who may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, especially in schools, high-density working environments and some large volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of personal protective equipment in the event of encounters with a person with COVID-19.
The OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with COVID-19 suspected or known to present a high risk of exposure, moving to a very high risk if they perform procedures producing aerosols or sampling or handling of samples of persons with a suspected or known COVID-19.
The appropriate risk checks for these workers include technical checks such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and task-specific personal protective equipment.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have become ill, have to take care of others or fear possible exposure.
Business models may change, both with respect to the goods requested and the means of acquiring them (such as shopping outside rush hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of items from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted. An infectious disease preparedness and response plan may be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors related to the family and community context, and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also outline the controls needed to deal with these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Plans for the preparation and response of infectious diseases may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
Response objectives to an epidemic include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining business operations and reducing adverse effects on other parts of their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The hierarchy of risk controls forms an overall framework used in occupational health and safety to group risk controls by effectiveness.
Where COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on workers' behaviour, and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls refer to changes in policies or procedures at work that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the worker's risk, properly adapted to the needs (e.g., respiratory masks), worn properly and systematically, inspected regularly, maintained and replaced as required, and properly removed, cleaned and stored, or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other collaborators.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory labelling, including covering their mouth and nose for coughing and sneezing, providing handkerchiefs and garbage, preparing for telework or staggered hours of work as needed, deterring workers from using other workers' tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a crucial step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease remain at home until they no longer have fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of febrifumes or other medications that affect symptoms, and advise employees to apply flexible sick leave policies, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and inform employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at medium risk of exposure include those that require frequent or close contact, less than six feet (1.8 m), of people without suspected or known COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to an ongoing community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip to an area with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density population working environments and certain high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of highly efficient air filters, increased ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic sanitary windows and the installation of a drive window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk include the encouragement of sick workers to stay at home, the replacement of face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, the introduction of staggered hours of work, the interruption of non-essential travel to areas with active VOCID-19 epidemics, the development of emergency communication plans, including a forum to address workers' concerns, the provision of up-to-date information and training to workers on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviour, the training of workers who need it in the use of protective hands and gloves, the provision of resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, the provision of information and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviour, the training of workers who need it in the use of protective hands and protective devices, the provision of a means of a regular display of exposure, of personal hands, personal hygiene, the personal hygiene, the need or the protection of personal hygiene, the protection, the protection of personal hygiene, the protection of personal hygiene, the workplace, or the protection of the

Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include: separating the patient from the other person by a distance of 6 feet, designating a member of the crew to take care of the patient and offering a protective mask to the patient, or asking him or her to cover his or her mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and, where possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or breathing difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items must be discarded in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls include postponing the journey in the event of illness, as well as self-isolation and immediate information to the on-board medical centre if fever or other symptoms develop once on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the isolated person's cabin. For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection purposes if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of community spread.
In case of minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as cancelling educational outings, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals in the canteen, increasing the space between offices, staggering arrival and exit times, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate infirmary for children with flu-like symptoms.
In the event of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays can be envisaged. For law enforcement officers who perform routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to come into contact with persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as paramedics, including the wearing of adequate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt prior to reuse using a household detergent wipe or spray and follow the standard procedures for containment and disposal of used PPE and for containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers some health and funeral workers to be in high or very high risk categories of exposure.
High-risk jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to suspected or known COVID-19 patients.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they perform procedures producing aerosols or collecting or handling patient samples with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling.
Funeral jobs with a high risk of exposure include workers involved in the preparation of bodies of people with suspected or known COVID-19 at the time of death; they move to a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known COVID-19, including when carrying out aerosol-producing procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health and funeral settings.
Samples should be handled using level 3 biosafety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms based on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other PPEs, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for people working within 6 feet of patients with a suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95-approved or superior NIOSH-approved respiratory filtration masks must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide better protection and comfort for the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by body fluids.
WHO recommends the use of a surgical mask only by screening staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples, take care of or transport COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, eyeglasses or facial display, blouse and gloves.
If a procedure produces aerosols, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a room occupied by a COVID-19 patient to those directly involved in its care, the use of PPE necessary for the specific task only, the continued use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the management of several patients with the same diagnosis, the monitoring and coordination of the PPE supply chain and the deterrence of the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Lighten the load and prepare the future
DATE/TIME OF SENT: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
This month we are in an exceptional situation.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and our responsibilities to each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the kind of global empathy, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and benevolence we have observed among all our colleagues in emails, calls and instant conversations is a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we are fortunate to work.
I cannot be more grateful and proud to have all of you among my colleagues.
Last week, someone expressed gratitude to me for our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia right now, and the strong symbol of the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain the operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the security of our communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but also how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make significant adjustments to how we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team-c met last night to discuss our approach and schedule in the days and months ahead.
During this conversation, we considered what we believe would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
Above all, we were committed to eliminating stress and supporting our long-term mission.
If you need to step back, don't worry.
To all staff, contractors and contractors:
our daily working time target will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you may be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, shop or see a doctor, your well-being is our top priority.
We're not watching your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should go without saying, but we say so.
No sick leave or paid leave required: simply notify your supervisor and help your team review schedules and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19, please notify Bryan of the T&amp;C Ops department for T&amp;C to help you and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention from management).
The hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our sub-contractors and our hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal conditions.
This applies if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to relieve their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to contact your superior, so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things that we must continue to do.
The SRE, Ops HR, Trust & Security and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing an essential job that may require reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting the core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to "work twice as hard to make up for lost time" when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will strive to establish new targets and timelines where appropriate.
What about the APA (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and daily working time targets, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to set a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, take care of them and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their work schedule reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of timelines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as they are confirmed.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco-based colleagues may have been exposed to COVID-19.
However, in excess of caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol that uses products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return to it.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork premises, which shared with us and all Washington DC-based staff its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a fully remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco's advice.
As some of our New York-based colleagues know, we also debated the idea of renting a room in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but could be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues familiar with remote work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and would like to offer you some advice:
Reduce the length of meetings to meetings by up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider distributing them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Make videos the standard, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or make a collective note).
Send an email to the technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your wellness refund for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk with your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinars to support the increase in the distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of the community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edit-a-thons, until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed-upon grant activities and that no one would be penalized if these objectives were delayed or modified.
Next week, we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sadness at the upheaval and relief at the clarity and opportunity to focus on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for the rest, the TRC is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Stay in touch despite COVID-19 problems
We will send an invitation on your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this time to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
Until then, you can always find the information contained in this email, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The TRC will update these pages and collect all information in the same location.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a significant workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help with anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the TRC.
We are here to support and liaise with you if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive questions, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judan, Director of International HR Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as an abandonment of our work and obligations.
On the contrary, it is a matter of recognizing that at present our work and obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps we consider necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help it needs, and to offer the world the service on which everyone can rely.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us in due course.
For the time being, it is time to help each other and prepare for the important work that will happen in the weeks and perhaps in the months ahead.
We need each of you to do this, which is why you need to preserve and care for your families so that you can give the best of yourself when the time comes.
Finally, please: wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, the TRC (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b'The angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme bound to the outer side (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 against the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7) making it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 is also the point of entry into the cells of certain coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-ended peptidase domain M2 and a C-ended renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein of type I, the enzyme active domain of which is exposed on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheldase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood stream and finally excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is linked to the cell membrane primarily cells of type II pulmonary alveoli, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial cells of smooth muscles of most organs.
The expression of ACE2 mRNA is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate for ACE.
ACE cleaves the hormone angiotensin I to angiotensin II vasoconstrictor.
ACE2 in turn cleaves the carboxylic amino acid phenylamine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and the hydrolysis to vasodilatating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also cleave several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dysnorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the primary entry point into the cells of certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of the S1 spicule protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ACE2 at the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes within the cells.
This entry process also requires the initiation of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, inhibition of the latter is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can contribute to controlling infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitor who had a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less conclusive than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The recombinant human angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (rhACE2) is seen as an innovative treatment for severe lung lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the time to action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour duration of effect.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people who are intolerant to conventional renin-angiotensin inhibitors (ARS) or for diseases with high angiotensin II circulation. RhACE2 under infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracing of contacts in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of people ("contacts") who may have come into contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the government in certain territories and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracing applications.
These systems, particularly those based on tracking the geographic location of application users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a feature to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people carrying COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has opted for an application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local information society community, it has been provided in open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth app that tracks exposure to potentially infected people and communicates quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracing application was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering implementing applications based on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia would like to introduce a geo-reprofiling application for patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis and residing in Moscow, to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, spoke of several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and the lack of potential efficiency if only a small portion of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple only allows "official" or generally trusted organizations to add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists raised concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat has been removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have stipulated eight conditions to be met in government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Extensions of control and surveillance should include sunset clauses;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19 control objectives;
data security and anonymity should be protected in a demonstrable manner;
digital surveillance should ensure that there is no exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the law;
protections against abuse and remedies for citizens should be provided in the event of abuse;
The "significant participation" of all "relevant stakeholders" would be mandatory, including public health experts and marginalized groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) in Germany have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the issue of continued surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism of their device operating system as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracing.
In Israel, network tracing has been approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present significant potential privacy concerns.
However, not all central server-based systems need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, thereby respecting privacy (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used for tracing contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including tracking data for mobile devices and card transactions, which they then associated to send SMS warnings to potentially infected people.
In addition to the use of this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made location information publicly available, which was allowed as a result of extensive changes to the privacy laws following the MERS epidemic in that country.
This information is available to the public through several applications and websites, and countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized privacy systems.
Details had not yet been provided on 6 April 2020.
The tracking of privacy-friendly contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large amount of research data as of 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly known as Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leaves the device and that all matches are made on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy techniques when collecting and using location or contact data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Enigma MPC's SafeTrace platform, a company developing privacy technologies originally founded at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, a key factor in their adoption by a wide audience.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced the release of the source code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, who control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative, stating that it would preserve privacy and combine Bluetooth Low Energy technology with privacy cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable governments to create formal privacy-sensitive coronavirus tracking applications
direct integration of this feature into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address the problems of solution adoption and persistence of monitoring by initially distributing the system through operating system updates and later deleting it in the same way once the threat is removed.
Repositioning a medicinal product (also known as reorientation, reprofiling, reassignment or change of therapeutic indication of a medicinal product) refers to the conversion of a medicinal product approved for a disease or for a medical condition different from that for which it was originally developed.
It is a scientific research axis currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusion of plasma from convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides the realistic project for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like protease, dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug also used to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be part of the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that New York State trials for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Physicians have indicated that they use this medication "when there is no alternative".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Broader studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was "clearly effective."
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study in Wuhan in 240 pneumonia patients, half received favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has reminded the public that the evidence in favour of the medicinal product is thin and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the medicine in Japan for its reserves and use the army to deliver the medicine to university hospitals where the medicine would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for Trump administration to acquire the medication. The medication may be less effective in serious cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to procreate.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
These drugs have been designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would link to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for repositioning drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO has included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences then discovered that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against several filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies prior to the trial suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by University Hospitals in Cleveland; one involving people with moderate pathology and one involving those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two controlled against placebo (China and Canada) and one without control (Italy).
New York State began testing for the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial of Teijin's alvesco (ciclesonide), an inhalation corticosteroid used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
One form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a Phase II trial is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from among the severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with moderate COVID-19 symptoms.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who have been diagnosed positive for COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to issue guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study involving 300 patients and studying the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic assays was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous outbreaks such as MRS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Trials are also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed the clinical tests, many developmental attempts are underway.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the disease, for at least 18 months.
As of April, five vaccine candidates were in the course of a Phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic broke out around the world in 2020, generating significant investment and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
Defined in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
The main platform targets for Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biology, adenoviral vector type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine applicants are in the early stages of development, of which 78 (79 according to Milken Institute) are confirmed as active and 37 announced, but with little public information available (presumed to be under planning or design).
A Phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomised, controlled against placebo and performed in several centres, while determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the efficacy of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring adverse reactions at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active-development vaccine applicants (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet in the assessment phase on the human person (still in "preclinical" research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular clamped vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.

Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had started working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen develops an oral vaccine in collaboration with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that of neo-antigen vaccination used for cancer treatment.
On 25 March, the director of the research institute announced that they had finalized the vaccine synthesis and were starting testing.
On February 27, 2020, a Generex subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it had started a vaccine project to create an Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St Louis announced its vaccine development project.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both located west of Maryland, announced work on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emerging Biosolutions announced that it is partnering with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced pre-clinical testing projects and a Phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even under accelerated procedure, it would take about a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported developing a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is currently being researched in the laboratory, with human tests scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian announced that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "strong sums of money to benefit from exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine", which sparked the German government's protest.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of a mRNA-based vaccine.
The BNT162 mRNA vaccine candidate is currently in preclinical testing phase with the start of clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the human test of its final vaccine candidate could start in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a consortium for the research of a COVID-19 vaccine including the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total CEPI investment in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
The other CEPI investment partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifier RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of China sending the sequence.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine applicants at Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of C$192 million dedicated to the development of a COVID-19 vaccine with projects to create a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that can be used if further coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, stating that "SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine subunits administered by micro-needles triggered a significant response of antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a candidate DNA-based vaccine in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, combined with cloud-hosted IT resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia plans to include 4,170 health professionals.
Vaccines under development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the efficacy of a vaccine using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine against SARS that has demonstrated both its safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.There are no proven MRS vaccines.
When MERS spread, it was thought that existing SARS research could serve as a model for developing vaccines and drugs for MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three more were in progress; all vaccines were viral vectored, two adenoviral vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications released a conspiracy theory that the virus that caused COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited in various social media publications refer to existing patents dealing with genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
While the majority of cases cause moderate symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have healed. The virus spreads mainly during proximity contact, often by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or speaking.
Because these droplets are produced at expiry, they usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than pose an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and during subsequent phases of the disease. The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities not recommending their use, others recommending their use, and others imposing their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking, and blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, superior respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying proportions.
Some cases in China initially experienced only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some, the disease can cause pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may be up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary evidence suggests that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not exhibit symptoms is currently unknown and under study. Korean centres for disease prevention and control (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1st; of 166 infections found today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both sputum and saliva can carry significant viral loads.
Talking loud releases more droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not transported by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside the patient chambers produced viral RNA positive samples.
Certain medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (CPR) can disperse respiratory secretions and thus cause air propagation.
Although there are concerns about stool spread, this risk is perceived to be low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spread may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not yet clear how easily the disease is spreading, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives for hours or even days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected after one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and after four hours on 99% copper.
This varies, however, depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, which deactivates and eliminates it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three individuals with pneumonia related to Wuhan's acute respiratory disease outbreak.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. The SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
Lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme, which is the most abundant in lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spicle" (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage has been reported in 12% of people admitted to Wuhan Hospital, China, and is more common when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be related to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and cardiac functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) has been observed in patients in intensive care units with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with an adverse prognosis. Autopsies of deaths of COVID-19 have shown diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 exhibits a tropism for respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF secretory T-cells have been associated with recruitment of IL6-secreting inflammatory monocytes and severe pulmonary pathology of COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported at autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, nasal or sputum sampling may also be used.
Generally, results are available in a few hours or up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, however they require two blood samples taken within two weeks and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world were able to independently develop chain polymerization reaction (PCR) tests to detect virus infection.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (likely to detect active infections and an individual's previous infection) were being developed, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese test experience revealed an accuracy of only 60-70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test to the closest to the patient on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the University of Wuhan's Zhongnan Hospital suggest infection detection methods based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobary bilateral frosted glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the onset of infection.
Dominance under pleural, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may occur with disease progression.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and on the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumococytic hyperplasia, extensive atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARD) and severe hypoxaemia.
pneumonia in healing: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leuco-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded areas, frequently washing hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
Correct hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended that the face be covered with tissue in public places in order to limit transmission in the case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the contact of infected persons with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing travel and cancelling large groups of people.
Distancing instructions also include respect for a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
There are no drugs known to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, a key element of COVID-19 management is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "flatten the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
It also recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant solution containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where hand disinfectants are not available, WHO proposes two formulas for local production.
In these formulae, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores from alcohol, it is "not an antiseptic active substance for hands."
Glycerol is added as a moistener.
People are treated with supportive care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analysed.
Personal hygiene, healthy lifestyles and diets have been recommended to promote immunity.
Supportive treatments may be useful for those with moderate symptoms at the early stages of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of hospitalized patients for COVID-19.
Re-animators and pneumologists in the United States gathered therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some healthcare professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen in the first line.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, particularly under care conditions when carrying out procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health care professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an airborne isolation chamber (AIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne transmission precautions. The CDC outlines the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respiratory masks (facial masks) are preferred.
N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect aerial particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
Where masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial protection screens, or as a last resort, hand-crafted masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are severe.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is actively studied for hospitalized people. There is evidence that intubation can be avoided by using a high-throughput nasal cannula or double-level respiratory positive pressure.
It is not known whether either or both generate the same benefits for people in critical condition.
Some physicians prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-throughput nasal cannula. Serious cases are more common in older adults (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the care system to deal with a sudden peak in the number of COVID-19 cases that are serious enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARD) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices with high pressure control modes and PEEP are needed to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of pulmonary damage associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are undergoing clinical trials.
Remedesivir appears to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several drugs under test are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral medicine can be tried in people with severe illness.
WHO recommended volunteers to participate in trials on the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. FDA has granted temporary authorization to plasma of convalescent individuals as an experimental treatment in cases where the life of the person is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and identifier.
The application is able to detect "close contacts" using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend self-quarantin, it also alerts local health authorities. Massive data analytics of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people they have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data from people suspected of having coronavirus.
The purpose of the measure was to enforce quarantine and protect persons who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated telephone localization data with the German federal government's agency, the Robert Koch Institute, so as to analyze and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect quarantine.
In Italy, regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people continue to travel".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global call to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor stating, "enhanced social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may develop moderately with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as colds.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is a lack of data for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARD) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include septicaemia, coagulation disorders, and cardiac, renal, and hepatic damage.
Coagulation disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of hospitalized cases with COVID-19, with renal impairment observed in 4% of patients in this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with COVID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the average duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples exhibit diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The image of the lung resembles an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, cardiac damage due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest was observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized persons had pre-existing pathologies. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region may also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Undercounting of moderate cases may result in overestimation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are 2.4 times more likely to go to intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. Concerns also emerged about the long-term sequelae of the disease.
The hospital administration in Hong Kong has observed a 20% to 30% drop in respiratory capacity in some people cured of the disease, and lung scanners suggest organic lesions.
This can also lead to post-healing intensive care syndrome.
In March 2020, it was not known whether a previous infection had an effective long-term immunity in people cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered probable based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of persons cured of COVID-19 followed by coronavirus positive tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be a worsening of a latent infection rather than a re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by propagation of the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but as of December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost only led by transmission from man to man.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms dates back to December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time since the outbreak began, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO affected CIM-10 U07.1 emergency pathological codes for laboratory-confirmed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths of clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 cases without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death/case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global death/case ratio is 6.9% (153,822/240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the fatality rate (LFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die of the disease, and the rate of infectious lethality (IRF), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed or not) who die of a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected individuals develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of infected individuals.
In the epicentre of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and to young people, causing a relatively low mortality rate, and all COVID-19-related deaths may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of people may have antibodies, according to an assessment by blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed to be related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in humans in studies in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among 50-year-old men, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at the age of 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The precise reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioural factors may be part of it.
Immunological differences by sex, lower prevalence of smoking among women, and the development in men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than among women may have contributed to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died of COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government did not collect data associated with the type of COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health care workers, particularly nurses, are women and are at increased risk of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species, or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in its public communication.
Both the disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of the provisional disease names 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV for virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the Use of Places in Names of Diseases and Viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity limitations of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it in a timely manner, a local startup back-designed and printed the required 100 valves in one night.
After the initial COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is capable of spreading the disease to some other animals.
Studies have not been able to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY trial" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being researched.
First, researchers are trying to create an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response of the human body in the event of new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the S-spicle protein that helps the virus to infiltrate the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new vaccine creation technique).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluated previously approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Converted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials on remdesivir in several countries whose reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of clinical development of candidate vaccines and COVID-19 drugs was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with interferon beta.
Provisional data suggest the efficacy of remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with compassionate remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some call for an independent analysis of the research work.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that doubling this dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorization at the discretion of physicians caring for COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for continuation of an in vivo study after low-level inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicule protein initiating with serine 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE 2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinetic shock may be a complication at later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine anti-shock properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Commission of Health after a small study was conducted.
It is in the course of a non-randomised phase 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with a severe form of the disease.
Combined with a blood test of serum ferritin to identify cytokine shock, it must counter such developments that are suspected to be responsible for the deaths of some affected individuals.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cells, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for RCT.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems from people who have cured COVID-19 to people who need it is being studied as a non-vaccine passive immunization method.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action through which passive antibody-based treatment can generate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, such as using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of serum from convalescent individuals, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of cured patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted COVID-19 and died after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
