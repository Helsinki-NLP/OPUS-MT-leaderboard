Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped Thursday from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination equipped with wings), it rose to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate shrine, located at more than 3,000 metres above sea level, where many badauds had gathered to observe its feat.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners find it difficult to find the money to repair the road infrastructure in decrepitude, many people are looking for a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches itself above the dashboard of your car.
The aircraft, which records all the miles driven by a motorist and transmits the information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in the planning government offices to redesign the outdated system of financing the major U.S. roads.
The generally uninterested sector of major axis planning suddenly sparked a lively debate and heated alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups to lobby for the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and eventually the road on which you travel, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is down.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress are unable to agree on whether to continue, several states have not waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles travelled.
Thousands of motorists have already embarked these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental trip.
This is truly essential for our nation.
"It's not like we have a choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, who predicts that the state will start recording the miles travelled by every Californian motorist by 2025.
There's going to be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, funded with taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars can travel more than miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
"The gas tax is simply not tenable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed trackers on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
"This turns out to be the most logical long-term alternative," he said.
Wunks calls this a mileage user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces urban liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state's ambitious laws on global warming.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chair of the House of Representatives Transport Committee, said he also saw it as the most viable long-term alternative.
Supporters of the Reason Foundation's free market also appreciate the idea of charging drivers per mile.
"It's not just a tax coming into a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice-president of politics at Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they receive.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transport Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to move towards payment per mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved approximately 10,000 cars.
But the Speaker of the House killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to their work or to the city.
Nevertheless, several States and major cities are making progress on their part.
The most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the country's largest experience.
These motorists will soon pay the state kilometric fees instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering one.
Illinois is trying a trial on a limited number of trucks.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the American east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is exploring how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their cars with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their every move.
"Anxiety about Big Brother and this kind of thing is a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads strategic performance management in Nevada's Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
From the start of the test, the Nevada ACLU warned at its site: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged location devices."
It is not necessary to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily goings and comings.
Nevada is one of a few states that are now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
Researching this technology has led some state agencies to use a small California start-up named True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to assist motorists who pay taxes to states.
It sought to break into the emerging auto insurance market, in which drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices it tests have pleased major axis planners because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't record their speed and locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Great mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are far less costly ways and far less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experiment by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all state residents.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transport officials are looking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide "driving payment" insurance, and create a real-time speed data set from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Car drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them," said a paper on urban development.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the whole debate on mile payment is not simply a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume much gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgery when you simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the Commission's Director of Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unreleased Listeners
The English musician hasn't finished surprising this year.
Starting with The Next Day, released in January, it concocted a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several new releases.
Four have already emerged on the web.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone pantois.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he had declared that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dates from 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be counted on to sparkle the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than a lap in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke has planned to re-release this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
He introduces both each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pouches, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with lyrics...
And, above all, he gives a foretaste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and a cleverly mastered rock electricity.
New ones already on the listener list
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal her charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a light cavalcade that gradually slows down to give way to a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John's Rocket Man or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
Guitar riffs, bewitching, make you want to leave the Earth.
Bowie has fun in any case playing chameleon with these titles: informant turns, man aboard a rocket, Martian potential...
He hides and reveals at once, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
Nothing surprising that he had a mask in his hand in the photograph of the campaign L'Invitation au Voyage, by the Louis Vuitton brand, whose new face he embodied.
It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that injured soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was being followed by all soldiers prior to their return to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr.Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured members - who do not meet the "universal service" rule of the army requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for pension benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by La Presse canadienne, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, was released from the military despite his request to stay another year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case followed that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before being ready because he did not meet the rule of universality of service.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that it was totally different than wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with La Presse canadienne on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has struggled to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks, but who are not fit for combat.
Under the current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployments, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicate that of the 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of service required to obtain pension benefits.
Liberal veteran spokesman Jim Karygiannis asked Wednesday for Corporal Hawkins' reinstatement, while New Democratic Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney bets on the tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney decided to favor tablets over its own television channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its phone and tablet app.
Its worldwide launch on Disney's channels is not expected until 2014, details the press release of its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, intended for children aged 2 to 7, tells the adventures of the pussy Callie, sheriff of a city in the American west where she makes order with a magic lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, Vice President for Digital Products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the press release.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms," he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of those under 2 years of age have already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of those under 8 years of age, compared to 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence informant, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met on Thursday with Mr Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys the right to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter that the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said, "Although the result of my efforts was obviously positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is charged with spying and stealing state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told the Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will make this possible."
Relations between the United States and Germany were strained by complaints that the NSA had tapped the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States," it was necessary to take advantage of it.
Mr Ströbele, a German Green MEP, published a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden was testifying in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be "safe" there, said the MP.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "serious and sustained" persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global reaction to “my act of political expression”.
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – considered the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance to be of public benefit.
The letter puts forward an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix video-on-demand service via their television in a future that does not seem so far away.
Cogeco's subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary testing of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to highlight more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options," explained Cogeco's President and CEO, Louis Audet, in an interview.
Cogeco Cable is thus following in the footsteps of its competitors, such as Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary does not yet have a specific date for this new platform.
"We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our clients do not currently have access to.
The Rogers telecommunications giant has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, could be resolved.
In the United States, the popular video service claims to be in discussions with some major cable companies to make its service available via their broadcast platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in its Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for pay-per-view services.
"It's been about two and a half years since we've been saying that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large chain packages doesn't work," said Audet.
He hopes, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
"A new kind of frame of reference will have to emerge from these discussions to define our new Canadian cultural policy with respect to television," said Cogeco's CEO.
The CRTC has been consulting with the public since last week and is expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the results side, Cogeco reported a net profit of $43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¢ per share.
This is a decrease from the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83¢ per share, for the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline by amortization costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired the US-based Atlantic Broadband cable company for $1.36 billion in 2012.
This was the company's first major acquisition after the one that failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montréal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Entreprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for $526 million.
As for Cogeco's revenues, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are $1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, of the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable's revenues increased by 45% to $470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the 2013 fiscal year, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is on the rise 5,546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned that the number of clients fluctuates in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very strong competition.
Horses in beef products
Horse meat was detected in cans of beef products, sold by two small UK retail chains at low prices, today announced the food hygiene agency.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA of 1 to 5%.
"Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," explained the UK agency.
A scandal about the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to reviews by the European Commission, France has been the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four, early Friday, on Highway 131, in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a motorist who was travelling in a northerly direction in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and struck a car that was coming in the other direction.
The four occupants of both vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic was back to normal around 6:00 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers carrying carry-on-flight baggage for up to $100.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in her announcement on Wednesday, she indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them down the plane.
New hand luggage charges are for bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free of charge.
Frontier stated that it would charge $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if travellers paid only once at the boarding gate.
Frontier's spokesperson, Kate O'Malley, indicated that the $100 was provided to encourage travellers to pay the fees in advance.
"We don't want to charge that price," she explained.
The airlines started charging for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these costs put as many things as they could in the carry-on baggage stowed in the upper compartments, so there was often no more room in these compartments.
These charges are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said these new fees will not really be used to raise money.
It is a question of making the most loyal Frontier customers understand that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase their ticket from the airline's website will not have to pay.
For example, a passenger queued at a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and check-in procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these charges before arriving at the door.
Frontier's hand baggage charges will not be applied until the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often frown about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people in Wall Street view the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines charge enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, many of them did not receive the cost of baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand baggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant company followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant to airlines Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the surcharge charges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's carry-on baggage charges were $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently travelled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate as passengers discovered the company's unusual carry-on charges.
"I've never seen such a fluid boarding procedure in my entire professional career," he said.
I expected to see a gnash of teeth and a fight breaking out at the door.
The aircraft was full, he added, "the passengers boarded at the speed of lightning."
Frontier also does as Spirit and charges $2 for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who take coffee can be refreshed free of charge.
It will always distribute water free of charge.
US Airways briefly attempted to charge for drinks in 2008 but returned back seven months after passengers complained and while no other major airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to charge for carry-on baggage when passengers do not purchase their tickets directly from the airline is its last effort to encourage customers to go to its site.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of going to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she reduced mile bonuses by 25% on a trip.
For example, a 1,000-mile border trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in its home town, Denver, but its business is shrinking and it is losing money.
Revenues fell by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to straighten Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA calls into question an "internal error" and not hackers for the breakdown of its site
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said on Friday that it was a bug that caused the breakdown of its public site for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the breakdown was due to a distributed denial of service attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been broken down for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson explained.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the breakdown of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactics is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The once ultra-secret NSA, a time dubbed the "No Such Agency", has found itself in the spotlight and heavily criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive national and foreign communications surveillance programs – which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by former disillusioned NSA consultant Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has caused a lot of speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
Delta City Centre now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta promises not to let down its employees.
Employers came to meet with employees directly on site, and employees were met individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains Delta Hotels Regional Director of Labour Relations, Félix Bisson.
The Delta is closed in a highly competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Either he was reinvesting in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, Chair of Tourism Transat at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for seniors.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totalling nearly 600 rooms will be launched in two years.
For Titan's CEO, "Goodyear Amiens buys project starts with zero employee"
After throwing out the towel in January for the partial takeover of Amiens-Nord's Goodyear site promised at the closure, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tiremaker Titan, declares, today, ready to save 333 jobs out of the plant's 1,137.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister for Productive Recovery, had already announced it on Monday 21 October.
After giving up the plan to buy the plant in January, you come back today.
You had uttered violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, "crazy" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand that volte-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr Montebourg, is a charming young man who is trying to save some of the best paid industrial jobs.
If I hurt someone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when working eight hours in other countries handicaps France.
In India, China and many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has space to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But, with a proper price and skilled workers, it's worth trying.
What kind of deal do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the plant's closure was announced, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance pay, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine Titan buys Goodyear's closed plant.
As a result, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other EU country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
But he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from around 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before he tries to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is for the CGT and Goodyear to seal an agreement on severance benefits for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the plant.
Mr Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd like a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance benefits.
If all employees accept them, the plant's purchase plan starts with zero employees.
How can we give job duration guarantees when there are no more employees left on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages to get the CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan buys the plant, we intend to stay in North Amiens for more than four years.
Bombardier's profit declines, as aircraft deliveries and orders decline
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in net earnings on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and aircraft deliveries during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide in-flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial commissioning schedule by September.
After the inaugural flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the test aircraft flew only three times, and the question then arose as to whether the test phase was on track.
The results were not in line with the forecast and the share price fell by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday from "overperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential for the stock exchange to increase in the next quarter or two quarters.
"Although the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed with the profit margin in the Transport division," Cameron Doerksen said in a memo to customers.
We expect Bombardier to register new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and first flew in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is so far modest at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's assertions about the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airliner.
Currently, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments with 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and CEO, is confident that Bombardier will meet its target of 300 firm orders prior to the commercial launch of the first aircraft.
Leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was progressing according to schedule.
"The test aircraft did not remain on the ground for longer than expected," said Mr. Beaudoin at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft's shutdown time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to make a first flight and provide an update period, and that's what we did.
This will happen again throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, while the others will follow shortly thereafter, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that it was in the process of evaluating the time frame for entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
"This slow flight testing – although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal schedule – reinforces our view that the start of service will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net income dropped to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The adjusted share result remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues decreased slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a result of 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared to 57 a year earlier.
Net controls have fallen to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aerospace division was $32.9 billion as at September 30, a figure unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
"In Aerospace, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing," said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aeronautics revenues fell by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest rail manufacturer, said revenues for this division increased by almost 11% to $2.1 billion.
The Transport Division's order backlog was $32.6 billion at September 30, a slight increase from December 31 of the previous year.
The Transport Division's margins have suffered from enforcement problems with some large contracts.
Leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's share price, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer of Google Inc, would be on the board of directors, fell by 8.5 per cent to C$4.83 in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third-largest aircraft manufacturer and the closest competitor to Bombardier, reported a 10% decline in its quarterly earnings on Thursday.
Two 23- and 27-year-old speleologists had been missing in a gulf under the Crolles tooth since Thursday evening, we learned Friday from the Speleo rescue of Isère.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one seasoned in practice and the other not, had gone underground on Thursday around 9:30 p.m. in order to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located on the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We had no news of them since then, said the same source.
"The speleologists should have come out around 5am," said Thierry Larribe, technical advisor to the Speleo rescue in charge of the relief organization.
Dozens of people on the spot
About 20 relief workers, ten civilians from the French relief service, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were there.
Late this Friday afternoon, the two speleologists were located.
"This is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but in good health in the cavity, passed the information on to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th Battalion of the Chambéry Alpine Hunters, were found "exhausted, but not wounded".
They got lost in the network, turned back on their feet while waiting for rescue, specified the prefecture.
Recharged, they should come out of the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union on Thursday invited its members to stop using Google's and Yahoo's online services in the wake of new revelations about the activities of US and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo's search engines and messaging until further notice," she says in a press release.
She considers the Washington Post's information "scandalous", according to which the U.S. National Security Agency (NAA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected mass of information by infiltrating international networks that allow both firms to synchronize their servers.
"The searches carried out by journalists are as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union who claims 38,000 members.
Repainted lights: Member of Parliament demands the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
Minister Brigitte Grouwels' plan to "relift" the signposts in Brussels does not appeal to everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in the centre of Brussels a test project consisting of repainting 16 signposts of the region in the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The aim is both "to increase security" and "the Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the long run, to repaint all the Brussels traffic lights at an estimated cost of around EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of the "flamandization" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content to spend the Brussels money madly in relifting the signposts in the colours of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues her operations of Flemishization of the Capital", warns Mr De Bock in a statement.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally painted the Brussels posts herself in dark-black blue-yellow.
According to the honourable Member, there is no longer "no difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brussels people deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who is carrying out the NVA program herself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
"For the record, Brigitte Grouwels was only elected with 2,245 votes or 0.5% of the Brussels population!" concluded Mr. De Bock.
the portico of Pont-de-Buis dismantled
The ecotax portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on site shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national was diverted in the wake.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the Finistère Prefecture on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomov, manager of the portico.
This is the last of the three ecotax portals in the state of operation in the department of Finistère, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessories store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google signed connected glasses.
They can thus acquire a earphone, a charger or a storage case.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective cover made of micro-fibres or an intra-ear headphones.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with corrective lenses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
It's been five years since my father got rid of the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I was going to keep "following him."
There is no recipe, no instructions to go through the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat as I was driving.
Another time, a sweet awakening in the middle of the night to watch his watch that no longer leaves me, placed on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
That's at least what I thought the day I found his body empty, clenched on that crisscrossed bed of hospital.
Similarly, his funeral was a frigid farewell centered around the meager glow of candles that surrounded his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Gradually, in small diurnal or nocturnal apparitions, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she regained her place in the landscape of my thought which thought she was mourning.
And then, she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother's person in any way but simply a woman I didn't really know, a woman who embodied that person, during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and liberated the person I loved, and now I was finding her, full and full.
This detour of the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved people never leave us.
I look like my father, "in and out" it seems.
I've always been told.
I never believed him at the time.
I had a hard relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was not afraid of him anymore and I could love him.
One day he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I quit smoking, when I was afraid, when I had pain...
He talked to me, he constantly encouraged me, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, lending him my body.
But it was never prying.
I could have had a personal life.
He gave me my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who said dead people are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week it's certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only there is always one thing that prevents me from accomplishing this moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me on the contrary and are part of my story and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
On the eve of my ultrasound where I had to know my baby's sex, I dreamed that I was waking up, getting out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the landing and he smiled at me and rejoiced that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he shared with joy what was happening to me.
And of course, he was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I am happy to tell you about this shared memory after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year earlier, she was on a trip with my family to Cuba.
That's the shock that his disappearance caused to the young bachelor I was at the time.
Nevertheless, I realized my mourning quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, to the point of making it a master's degree in a large school, were not, in hindsight, anodinous choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and speak of Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she taught me are always present, so I sometimes think about how she would want me to act at some point.
The same applies to my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and rightness of the one who was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes landing on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
Dead after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that triggers itself, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then, time allayed the pain.
Only the lack, the unanswered void, the need for her, to confide in me, to reassure me in the depths of her sweetness.
Yet, she's there, silent presence, she's here and she's looking at me.
Every morning, I see his anxious eyes lying on me, I see the rings that weigh his eyes, the lines around the lips that cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the forehead on days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at 43.
We feel his protection constantly, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually relearned to smile, and pronounce his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the hollow of the night when absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when morale is a bit reached.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the backwardness of time makes us realize how much she was conductor and we try to stay in the way she had set us.
If a being loved you very much, the absence cannot tear it out of your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I couldn't attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are consistent with his vision of things.
I have also had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep and I always wonder what he'll think.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, he will always be my reference.
It was kind of like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk between us.
Anyway, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It's almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son 6 years old.
The immense pain that then invaded me has of course eased but it is still close to me.
Very often he "landes" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that when I wake up I am even saddened to see that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I told him no, he answered me "I'm going down" but in such a real voice that I woke up in a rush, anxious and I lit the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that he was coming.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel watched and turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world would I leave this house where we were happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a responsible profession, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October has been Iraq's deadliest month since April 2008.
This Friday, Baghdad published official figures: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We don't tell the world to be at our side and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," Al-Maliki said this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not resolved, it will spread, and what is happening in Syria will spread too.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki spoke to the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They brandished signs accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with assistance.
Cocainomaan lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed in the open.
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Liverpool Assize Court
A great defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug-related activities after having compromised because of his habit of using cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by criminals as a "prime case", was arrested at home in 2011 following police listening operations directed at Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
Police officers spotted 32-year-old Sarborough dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a bar dinner with confreres.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought unlawfully to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then under police surveillance in a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire counties.
Together with 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after police seized heroin and cocaine for £1.5 million, as well as over £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, provided information to criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would be revealed.
Today, at the Liverpool Assize Court, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Solicitors law firm located in Blackburn, has fallen into disgrace after being convicted on two counts of obstructing justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine in a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing drugs, 60% pure, under the lawyer's trash cans in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, pregnant with the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer went back home, found out about the drugs, and they called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine. He stated that he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and attempted to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During an interrogation, he stated that he owned an office at his home, as well as at his place of work, and that he was sometimes called home by clients for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that he was calling major players in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, "If anyone should know that we should not break the law, he is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with particular clients.
The relationship we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He obstructed the investigation of the police as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honour his profession, but dishonored it.
He was too close to some clients, particularly Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied anything illegal and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn't have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta went from criminal attorney to criminal lawyer himself as soon as he began to get drugs from criminal organizations."
His addiction to cocaine has compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the ulterior motives of senior members of organized criminal groups who tasked him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and build confidence among the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this confidence and tried to hide behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted the investigation into Mr. Ditta, who was convicted of the three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstruction of justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecute criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and translate you to the courts.
Scarborough was himself imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question-and-answer session about himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America, his last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be back on stage in December
The Detroit News newspaper reports that the queen of soul will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board Hall of the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
In November, Mrs. Franklin recorded an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying her illness, the famous interpreter of Respect had told the media on 16 October that the side effects of a treatment she received were "difficult".
She claims to be "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lights
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometers of seafront covered with a coat of light: one could close the hot blow in Menton with the invoice of illuminations.
Invoices which, unlike many municipalities, are also regulated by taxpayers, not by trade associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses leds.
But also a differentiated management of the network of public lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after shooting
A shooting took place at the Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to the local police, at least two people were injured.
This would be an employee working for the United States Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the gunman.
The incident reportedly occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff rushed to the exits or to the tarmac.
Very quickly the police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful in the previous season.
Through five saynets imagined and performed by artists from the region, vignettes featuring a high dose of humor, teenagers are allowed to tame classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Society of Lyric Art of the Kingdom will return with its Lyric Destinations, a formula that is now full hall at the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists from the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
In addition to these activities, there was the Lyric Period, the benefit concert held last August, with the help of the soprano colorature Marie-Ève Munger.
It was a benefit activity, alongside the artistic dimension, and it helped the not-for-profit organization produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft in the ears as an air of The Bat.
Without giving precise figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness of so many cultural institutions, the future is bright, even in the long run.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
"The finances are afloat and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a step we will take in seven years," the administrator commented.
"I'd even say beyond," added Managing Director Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Mustapha Hassan was accused of hostage-taking, kidnapping, threatening, carrying a weapon for a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Paquet by communiqué.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and is due to appear in court on Friday.
New application for class action against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new application for class action was filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults allegedly taking place this time at the Oratory Saint-Joseph as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The application is based on the complainant's testimony, identified as "J. J.", who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher the brother Submitted, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the oratory Saint-Joseph, where he was serving as a mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was for only three institutions, and when the settlement was announced, many people told us, "I was in such a place, can I register?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The unique feature of the recently filed class action is the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the St. Croix congregation.
At present, the appeal brings together complaints from 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the establishments concerned closed in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the Congregation of St. Croix and the oratory of St. Joseph, which is a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse against children", that they "exercised a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims", that they "were aware of the sexual abuse perpetrated and nevertheless suffocated them", and that they "consciously and consciously chose to ignore the problem".
These latter accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the St. Croix brothers' lawyer, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of St. Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The class action must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once admissibility has been accepted by the Court, the second stage, the hearings on the merits, is carried out.
In the case of the first appeal, the St. Croix congregation had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were held on the merits.
Significant fire in a trade
A fire caused serious damage to a business in the borough of LaSalle, Montreal, during the night of Thursday to Friday.
Rescue was called around 1:00 a.m. on Friday, due to a fire that had erupted in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Rejane Street.
Thirty firefighters who were sent to the scene took almost an hour to control the fire.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said the Chief of Operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the stage.
There were no injuries, but close to 20 housing units, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments may have to be accommodated temporarily, the SIM said.
Many opposition to medical assistance in dying at the Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical assistance in dying in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their lives, according to a spokesperson for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
Focusing on palliative care in Canada would make the approach to euthanasia minimal.
The president of the Réseau des soins palliatifs du Québec also rejects the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for the next generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she deplores.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to Suzanne Fitzback, vice-president of the Palliative Care Homes Alliance.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie House in Gatineau, felt that the service would be unnecessary anyway.
They never ask us, "I want to die, give me an injection."
Ontario's Hospice Palliative Care Association Director Rick Firth believes that the Quebec bill is disorienting the public about the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will follow suit.
For her part, the Liberal Member of Parliament for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, said that the notion of the end of life would have to be clarified before the bill was passed.
Kenya's press is outraged by controversial media law
"It is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" the newspaper said by contesting the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media court "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would undermine Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the Speaker will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and refer it back to parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to have "control over the media." The Standard, for its part, indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had suffered a hard blow" and castigated the bill calling it "draconian."
The adoption of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate shopping centre last September.
The Kenyan media aroused the anger of the authorities by disseminating images of video surveillance cameras on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack allegedly stole the luxury shopping centre.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to interview them, although the summons was withdrawn following a media shielding.
Under the new bill, media may be subject to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "deregistered" or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his or her fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single fine is enough to paralyse most FM stations."
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animated blogosphere".
By silenced the media, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Lived to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering."
Kenyan legislators have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission in charge of wages and restored their mirobolant wages of about 532,000 shillings per month tax-exempt – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists from the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) in Laval caused a great deal of concern to the management of the Hôpital de la Cité-de-la-Santé during 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short-term departures, the pharmacy department has found itself severely understaffed.
Almost 30% of the required staff was missing, making this fiscal year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
There was no use for troubleshooting, Ms. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities within the facility have been streamlined or reduced to level, as time has come.
We certainly worked hard to interest our young people [residents in pharmacies] so that they would come and stay here.
There's a combination of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 promises to be much easier for the CSSS pharmacy department.
Already, three pharmacists have returned to work after their maternity leave and three more pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain them have borne fruit, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to remain employed by CSSS.
Now it's a lot better, said the pharmacist.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
It will therefore fill our departures from last year.
Growing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have a young environment and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancy, we almost always drive to three maternity leave when it's okay, she added.
In the past year, we've had a lot more and we don't have pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old top model doesn't start his career in cinema with the little door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This pornographic drama grazes, in eight chapters that will be released in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a quadragenary addicted to sex since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin's resemblance to her elder is striking: a twig silhouette, a diaphanous complexion and Franco-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to pose naked on iced paper will appear in much more sulphurous situations on large screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac made the temperature rise on the Web: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he resorted to X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies numerically: above the belt, it is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has a habit of pushing her actresses into their last entrenchments, always for the better.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
Narbonne RMC room evacuated Thursday night
Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, as a result of tingling throats felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the facility manager had the room evacuated and warned firefighters about a suspicious smell.
About 70 people came out of the session.
The people were examined and a full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on a tear-gas jet background?
Or an involuntary incident?
Still, the film management has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was ventilated and everything returned to order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and the customers regained the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She's trying to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkins.
Taking advantage of Halloween day, a woman tried to get two kilos of cocaine into the country hidden in pumpkins on Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's baggage that the drug was detected.
Cocaine had been distributed into three pumpkins that had previously been emptied.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, CBSA spokesperson.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montréal-Trudeau airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 seizures of cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1,653 drug seizures.
Air raid against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese Army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday early in the afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of SA-8 short range surface-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new IDF air raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances roughly identical to the one that took place on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting the surface-to-sea missiles Yakhont, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their irritation at Washington revealing the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches bankruptcy
The credit rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, which has been in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's public debt securities goes to "B-", falling into the category of speculative investments.
It is accompanied by a negative perspective, with S&P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be further lowered within a year.
"It is less and less likely that the government's strategy will guarantee enough foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs," says the US agency.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.
These reservations, which the authorities use massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency increasingly considers a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs cash to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of intense tension with its Russian neighbour, furious with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, which is still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and is estimated by S&P to be 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, with a budget deficit, has been seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund for months, which had granted it $15.3 billion in 2010 and has so far released only $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF found this week that "large external financing needs" were "vulnerability", while pointing to "signs of economic improvement".
However, according to economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "no improvement can be expected in the short term".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year", with presidential elections scheduled for 2015, the expert said, questioned by the AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" associated with the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels is conditional on the release of opponent Yulia Tymoshenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be short- and medium-term negative consequences related to Russia's reaction," said S&P, who fears "trade restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for one quarter of Ukraine's exports, has warned that in the event of the creation of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls on imported goods.
US green light to the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday they received no objections from the US authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the review period for the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," both groups announce in a press release.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorization decisions issued in the other courts satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the operation to be carried out.
"The merger is also conditional on obtaining further regulatory authorizations and the approval of the shareholders of both groups," they added.
Congolese army hunts down M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would hunt down M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be about to be beaten after being driven out of the localities in the north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) which it had been controlling since the beginning of the insurrection 20 months ago.
"We're going to sue M23 and acculate it wherever he hides because they're criminals," FARDC spokesman Colonel Olivier Hamuli told Reuters.
We must not allow them to reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace back.
M23 officials explained that they evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, claimed on RFI that these military setbacks would in no way alter his demands at the peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and M23.
There are reports of clashes in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of insurgents to have fallen this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the flight of the government garrison and the passivity of the Monusco peacekeepers.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of strength, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff has been reorganized and the army has turned to the offensive against M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to be coming to an end," says Congolese business expert Jason Stearns on his Congo Siasa blog.
It would be historic - it would be the first time that the Kinshasa government has succeeded in defeating a major insurgency.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied to Rwanda would be present in the eastern DRC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, which fiercely denies it, of militarily supporting the M23, which was originally formed by former Congolese mutiny soldiers.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had referred to the possibility of military reprisals following shells falling into Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entry of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived with the M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable to us that we would ever be released by the army," says an inhabitant of this town bordering Uganda.
"We have lived in terror (of the M23), we are traumatized," added this man.
The tests carried out by the Institut Pasteur on a patient suspected of being infected with coronavirus were negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date".
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient was suspected of being infected, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already caused some 50 deaths.
Chevron, the second U.S. oil company, reported on Friday a decline in its quarterly profit due to the decline in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining behind the group's objectives.
Its net profit for the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged a profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company targets 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% increase in production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual capital expenditures have increased by $7 billion over two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities declined slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Thus Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported on Thursday a declining net profit, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
Transportation of school children: the complaint considered admissible
Since the beginning of the school year, the Sherbrooke Region School Board (CSRS) has charged $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students receiving school transportation to two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contributions were requested.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested," explains Ms Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediation and she asked for an additional time to think about it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to consult and to find solutions," Lefèvre says.
The Sherbrooke Region School Board (SSB) did not wish to comment.
The organization only indicated that mediation is part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the Hotel-Dieu's emergency rooms
Faced with the sling that has been run for several months by some of the staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "decalate the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of the closure of the emergencies which will not be able to intervene on 4 November".
An official request made "in order not to run any risk on the management of emergencies in Paris in the beginning of the winter" but which also aimed not to hinder the campaign of the PS a few months from the municipalities.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Even if the term "transformation" or "continuing change" is preferred to HPPA.
As of November 4, firefighters who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency visits to the Hôtel-Dieu will all have been instructed to take about thirty serious cases a day to the emergencies of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, emergency interns will leave room for five general medical interns on Monday.
As for the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the current month.
"The emergency reception service of the Hôtel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4th", assures Loïc Capron, the chairman of the medical establishment commission (CME) of the APHP, who supports the management's project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in emergency," he tempers, arguing that SMUR vehicles are permanently present on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain there, he also assures.
But it is up to the ARS to decide on the closure of the Emergency Response Service.
"Things are being done gradually," replied Nicolas Péju, spokesman of the ARS for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or we lied to him," says emergency doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Dismissed from his position as head of SMUR in early July for leading the sling against the reorganization project, he defined himself as a "warning launcher" in the face of a "cynical" decision taken by "the medico-administrative technostructure".
"They are emptying and asphyxiating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he says.
For him, "if the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem".
But they are regularly engorged.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours waiting in the Lariboisière emergency room.
At the ARS, it is argued that 30 "dispatched" patients at several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources have also been strengthened.
In both the ARS and the APHP, the "new hospital model" already launched since 7 October is being defended, which is expected to continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners are also expected to participate in the establishment of an "ambulatory care permanence".
"Where do we go if people are asked to self-diagnose," asks Gérald Kierzek for whom "the concept of emergency is not serious" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
It's going to happen as it does for the level three maternity wards.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where there's the best care offer.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the braquet, warns Christophe Prudhomme, an emergency doctor and member of the CGT Santé.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will think about presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP Paris councillor and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Paris UMP were for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, candidate PS, recalled Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, she would signal her clear disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, her spokesperson.
Even if the restructuring of the Hôtel-Dieu has its legitimacy in substance, we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of deferral to other hospitals.
Obama puts an end to wiretaps targeting the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop its surveillance of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, says an American official on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to regain control in the NSA wiretapping case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that the IMF and World Bank surveillance by the intelligence agency has been mentioned since the beginning of the scandal.
When asked about the issue, a US government official replied: "The US does not conduct electronic surveillance targeting World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington".
Speaking under the seal of anonymity, he did not specify whether such monitoring had been put in place in the past.
Another official indicated that Barack Obama had ordered the cessation of these practices in the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one ending the listening of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved on Thursday a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the retention of this information.
The United Nations welcomes the new goals for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now begin to work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been put in place 12 years ago to fight global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in promoting the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015 before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final preliminary draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it is now time to "exceed national interests".
"I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These SDGs will build on progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing at the same time as conflicts erupt between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, founding president of Mozambique, twisting them, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to return; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes for a T-shirt marked "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd piled up in Independence Square of the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, almost every day there have been reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall back into an open conflict, but recent events have rocked foreign investors and the local population.
The stakes are considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal reserves in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo reject each other's responsibility for the tensions.
Renamo states that the government is behind the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.
Attacks on former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, and Fernando Mazanga, the Renamo spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government blames the Renamo for triggering the conflicts, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
The Frelimo and the Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga declared that the Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness," Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
"They are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep arguing," said Joseph Hanlon, an open university lecturer and specialist in Mozambique.
None of them knows how to negotiate and none of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of votes won by the Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to win more votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who is expected to retire at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is not clear exactly what the capacity of the Renamo is, but it has carried out disruptive flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
The Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mr. Mazanga.
Instability has increased the frustration of the government," said Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, "and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that the leaders of the country's future are the government and the president, and that it is up to the president to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protestant, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "life style models," says the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that "brutal force does not weigh against subtle cunning", while arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "far too violent, far too scandalous and in some cases, far too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland called for "a careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's great that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been advocating this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are "openly didactic" means that the children "receive completely", the messages being "sublimated" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said, "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything needs to be simplified or finished well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a history rather than declared.
The known basis of what we show and don't say.
One fighter from Hamas' military-terrorist wing was killed tonight and another wounded by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza have learned.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they were shelled by an Israeli armoured vehicle.
NSA spying: the United States is "going too far," Kerry admits
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in the area of espionage, acknowledged Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first Washington admission in full controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NAS).
After ten days of scandal, revelation and denial between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time that an American government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in NSA interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I concede to you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this does not happen again in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London in which he participated from Washington on Thursday 31 October via video link.
In his retransmitted speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has at length justified intelligence and information-gathering practices through the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Referring to the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the American authorities had since foiled many plans for attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered, because we were able to be aware upstream of these projects," the US diplomacy boss argued.
And, said John Kerry to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived".
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far inappropriately," the Secretary of State, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday night that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and that he was conducting a review of these practices so that no one felt mistaken".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from ex-NSA consultant Edward Snowden, claims that the program named "MUSCOLAR", and conducted with the British NSA counterpart, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to retrieve data from optical fibers used by internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected in January alone - ranging from metadata on e-mails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google denied any connection to these practices.
Over the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from allies in the United States and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the US president was not aware of such listenings, Barack Obama refused to express himself on this subject, invoking national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied him that his intelligence agency had received tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even sent the bullet back to the European intelligence services that allegedly handled these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would concern "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and this would not be aimed at Europe at all," said General Alexander.
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by Americans as part of a vast international spying network that has also sparked China's ire.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without his master asset, Swede Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the Ligue 1 club in a statement.
PSG, leader of the championship ahead of Monaco in contrast to goals, released the list of players selected for this 12th day match, without including the 32-year-old striker.
The press release simply states that it is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he was suffering from inflammation of the left knee when he returned from selection at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the crematized deceased
The crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the crematized deceased in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for the mayor of Paris, is due to attend, and will then explain her proposals on funerals at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study carried out on September 6 and 7 among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a relative, this is the opposite: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune to lose a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book Death in Ash, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, stresses the "violence" of cremation, for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "violence made to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is due to the "elimination of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Protestant countries still badly lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," replied Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Apprivoiser la mort.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame it.
Approving cremation is for François Michaud-Nérard, general director of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to plan for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that to which he would be entitled with an burial.
Ipsos's annual survey shows a strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of the French want one, for their loved ones, be it religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of those who have chosen a cremation wish to organize a ceremony.
66% of the atheists or non-believers also desire it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For the past ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the burial of ashes," observes Mr Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the establishments now offer masters of ceremonies, who perform, in the presence of the body, the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to appoint the deceased, to link him to others, to evoke him, to give meaning to his death, to organize farewell.
This is the case at the Crematorium du Père Lachaise, since 1998.
Ceremonial masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the Crematorium du Père Lachaise has organized, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several memorial ceremonies, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of the people who were crematized in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online, to those who could not make the trip.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, the rehousing for rats turns into controversy
Earlier this week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
Faced with the urgency of the situation, the director of the Southern Lands Habitat Office, proposed, exceptionally and temporarily, to rehouse the couple and their three children in a new T4.
Yet the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has grown in exaggerated proportions, says Joel Canapa, the director of the board.
Rats, there's always been rats in the cities.
The deratization company carries out two passages a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, 64 interventions have been made.
The neighborhood is not left to be abandoned, and the rats do not swarm in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, but for two rats, we're not going to kill a kid.
"We didn't invite the rats to our house," defends the father who left his house to settle at the hotel.
We are soon without a penny and we are expecting a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange is down 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen, detrimental to export values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix yielded 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony dropped by more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house preying on flames in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out on Friday noon in Old Quebec was quickly brought under control.
More than 30 firefighters were sent to 9 Hébert Street.
The flames broke out in a house of three housing units spread over four floors located behind the courtyard of the Séminaire de Québec.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the firefighters arrived, many of whom intervened.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw visible smoke.
"Then the alarms were repeated, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck here," explained France Loiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec City firefighters.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the audience, in the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it was taken over more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of the headliners emerged in the Carolinas, and enjoyed great success, until they became too famous to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will feature the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for veterans, held at Madison Square Garden, which will include Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, as has the world of comedy.
Many of the actors participating in this year's festival went through non-traditional circuits, for example, performing on small television channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel ("The League" on the theme of FXX's joyfully lascif fantasy football) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the show "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the cast of the series "Parks and Recreation", yet she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young actors with a singular voice (surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction factors of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg chatting with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land which was called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at the City Hall in central Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that, when he was here, sometimes he was going down an alley between two buildings and he was thinking, well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here.
The price of oil continues to fall and is close to $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about the size of stocks offset a report showing that China's electricity-intensive manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The price of the US reference crude for delivery in December decreased from 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% drop for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The US Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which show growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8 per cent in the third quarter, after a decline that had not occurred in the previous two decades.
The Brent crude, a reference for the international crude already used by American refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 per barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Defamation of the right to abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal reinstated in Texas some restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This ruling means that a law adopted in July in this state and widely challenging the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The ruling of the Court of Appeal means that doctors who practice abortions will have to have an "admission privilege" with local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a physician, by virtue of his status as a health care member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre for the purpose of providing diagnosis or treatment.
The advocates of the IVG argue that the content of the law risks leading to an immediate closure of one third of state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women are reportedly deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a trial judge had held on the eve of the coming into force of the Act that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But the Attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is running for governor, asked the Court of Appeal to quash the trial judgment that blocked law enforcement.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star made a strong comeback, on the audience side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% audience share.
But was the show at the rendezvous?
Some 10,000 candidates ran for the auditions of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the villain Sinclair, the perch André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
Passed the excitement of regaining their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored in this first bonus.
As every year, the first audition shows brew a wide selection of budding singers, for better and sometimes for worse.
Now, on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, a few found their way there.
Many of them have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone all the way.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of successful singers are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make people laugh.
Court blocks decision on NYPD's control and search policy
A Federal Court of Appeal on Thursday blocked a judge's decision demanding changes in the New York Police Department's monitoring and search program and removed it from the file.
The United States Court of Appeal (second circuit) indicated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the outcome of the city's appeal.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and interrogate citizens.
The City appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and associated training program.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard arguments on the application for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be removed from the file because she violated the judges' code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and public statements in which she publicly reacted to the court's criticisms.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their monitoring and search program.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and has ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras carried on the body in the neighbourhoods where the largest number of controls are carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of retaining the names and addresses of persons whose cases were rejected after police control.
The hearing of the City's appeal is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactic of control and search has been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This system of control and excavation has existed for decades in some form, but the number of controls recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 controls that concerned mainly black men and of Hispanic origin.
A court action was initiated in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into a collective action.
Supporters advocating changes in the NYPD's monitoring and search program say they will put an end to unfair practices, allow for more effective and trusted police forces, and be able to change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say these changes undermine police morale without reducing crime, would represent a waste of money, and would not solve the larger problem of police under pressure after police force numbers have been drastically reduced over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that she was not putting an end to the constitutional control and search practices, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Tenants must go to vote, as each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of the accommodation that goes in taxes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each dwelling.
We are forced to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
By going to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We can't afford $100,000 fireworks, $4-$5 million land in case...
Go vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entering the 500 m2 of the Elysean kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the steps up to become a chef nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy, including at their holiday homes, and fed countless greats of this world in a near anonymity that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years old.
The man with an open face, a demarcated skull and intellectual glasses, born on 24 October 1953 at the Ferté-Saint-Aubin, holds a patisserie CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I have passed from one castle to another!", ironically Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manners of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen", to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
It does not displease heads of state who displayed a relative indifference to terrestrial foods, "they are all greedy," gently denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a little more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like".
The current head of state, who regained the lost pounds before the presidential campaign, has "no request for a specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially during the state dinners at the Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand if there were any mistakes.
The now former chef of the kitchens of the Elysée, who had a drink Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, leaves with a pinch in the heart".François Hollande came to greet me".
He said praise.
"His human side has come out," he says.
The chef will be replaced by his assistant, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-unit building, located at 15 Hébert Street, was the subject of three fire department alarms.
The fire broke out at the front, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid response of firefighters prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where the buildings are built in close proximity.
The burnt house housed four housing units, but no tenant was on site at the time of the fire.
The damage was all limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the sappers have dismissed the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: exit of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets escape some images of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is embodied by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will decode you in his role as a crazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "long island stockbroker, who refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a large corruption case on Wall Street".
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then mounted a scam that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man chaines the parties, the women, the drugs.
Decadence and excess of any kind are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had united them on Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long installation.
Looks like the movie finally lasts 2:45.
On December 25, he will be able to take part in the Oscar race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson reportedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a bogus tip on an affair involving then-in-office Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his "beautiful special advisor".
It was reported to the court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack Pawlby's voicemail and "permanently crash in front of his door," but Coulson also called him and left him voice messages.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of people's houses hoping to surprise them, it's the kind of man to like to present the story to people to see what they say about it," said Mr. Edis.
He said NotW used three ways to investigate topics: telephone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, monitoring, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Is he familiar with phone hacking?
He says the opposite, but we say "Of course we do."
Rumours about an affair involving Clarke were picked up first by NotW's editorial office when a source, experiencing a sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said that she had been told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A tape, on which pirated voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private investigator's computer that concerned Ms. Pawlby and her sister placed in a "Projects" file.
During the period when the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls where they were asked about her, Mr. Edis added.
In the meantime, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Ms. Pawlby's every move.
In a voice message he left to him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles about."
Mr Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The board heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while himself was with co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having carried out phone hacking.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, in full outbreak of violence
The U.S. President was scheduled to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, seeking help from the United States in the fight against the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced its deadliest month in five and a half years in October, according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday, 1 November.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations gives a higher figure, with 979 deaths and 1,902 injuries.
These violence are increasingly deadly despite strengthened security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shia-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of American troops, the level of violence is causing fear of a new fire while neighbouring Syria is in the throes of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot in the streets or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has led to this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, further violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five car bombs north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunnite extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
The violence is at the centre of talks in the United States with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the U.S. President, elected on the promise of ending military engagement in that country, had drawn an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since arriving in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has increased meetings with the executive, and Congressional elected officials.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But they also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shia, who attributed him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence through his "sectarian and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that "Iran's pernicious influence in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
Beijing accuses Uighur group of Tiananmen attack
China's internal security chief on Friday accused a group of Xinjiang Uyghur separatists of being behind the car bomb attack that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, ran into the crowd that was in the famous Chinese capital square, symbol of the deadly repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau responsible for internal security issues, accused the East Turkestan Islamic movement of being the instigator of this attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province Eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there driven by independentist demands.
"The violent terrorist incident in Beijing was organized and premeditated," Meng told Hong Kong TV.
"The group that stood behind the scenes was the East Turkestan Islamic movement," he added, his remarks being echoed by the New China Agency.
Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of Uighur origin and specified that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained gas-filled containers and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The Islamic movement in Eastern Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican probes into contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major survey around the world on how parishes manage sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage ties.
The poll was sent in mid-October to each national conference of bishops, with the instruction to get as many answers as possible.
The information will be used for an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, a Catholic newspaper independent of the United States.
A spokesman for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide on the appropriate way to probe parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the survey on the Internet by asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: Army attacks last rebel fief
The indomitables of M23, some hundreds of combatants, were cut off at nearly 2000 metres above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It has not stopped since this morning, fighting continues despite the night," told the AFP a resident of Jomba, reached by telephone around 12:30 p.m., and according to whom a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have pushed the rebels back a little".
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spend the night" in Jomba before going up to the front for a "sweeping operation".
There were very clear crepitations of small arms and light weapons behind him.
From Bunagana, a political fief and the last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapon detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the fighting entered "a final phase", with FARDC "circumcling residual M23 positions to dislodge them".
Since the resumption on Friday of the clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, the Monusco does not participate directly in the fighting, but it provides government troops with decisive support in intelligence, observation and planning.
In the late afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well-stocked with ammunition, went up towards the front line.
They were armed with kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road to Bunagana, a border post with Uganda, military personnel aided by civilians were loading a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, to replace another machine shelling M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila once again called on the rebels on Wednesday evening to "voluntarily demobilize" in order to be disarmed "by force", but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December without result for the moment.
On the spot, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, only Ugandan mediation has to organise the signature," said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side.
The M23 was born from a mutiny in April 2012 of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23, which is refuted by Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and its subsoil is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday according to the United Nations, the return movement to the DRC that had started in the morning reversed in the middle of the day.
"This morning we crossed over to go into our fields, but the military told us to retreat," told AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back.
It seems that the shootings are getting closer to the people.
In the early evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical, that beast of stage
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the sung and danced productions take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally found its voice.
It is a revolution: the French-style musical is asserting itself as a genre of success.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart's opera rock, most attempts were bogged down in ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Miserables bore the aureole of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at Châtelet and Stage Entertainment at Mogador changed the situation.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles as hit tubes.
The first one takes over, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the next one the world creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "La Belle et la Bête" may well be one of the successes of the season.
On other scenes, musical shows such as "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are in tune with success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Stories of musicals" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyses the reasons for the success so hard conquered.
How do French musicals evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First of all, there are the "musical spectacles" which evolve according to the wishes of the producers...
Some use beautiful screenshots of images and a real story as in 1789, Les Amants de la Bastille.
Others make a fifteen-year leap back on the pretext that you can serve almost anything when you have Matt Pokora on the headline.
After that, we have the musicals with the sumptuous productions of Châtelet that bring us back to the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musicals of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are trying to break through.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Kiss of Spider Woman" or "The Spring Awakening" have difficulty being funded.
Do we have enough capable artists like Broadway to sing, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talented artists who are turning projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of musicals, it's very different.
Young people are trained in these occupations in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The talent pool is as consistent as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor relative of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often boulevard theatre intended for adults and not for young adults.
Music shows fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
To propose beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of a craze of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are carefully maintained by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very much expected when they arrive in a province Zenith.
Mayonnaise went up to Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all major venues in France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver in the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury, on Friday morning around 5:30 a.m., in the inner ring of Brussels at the height of Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is unharmed.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00 a.m., at the accident site, until the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause any traffic jams as the accident took place at the Hoeilaart exit.
Traffic could therefore be diverted by this exit/inlet of the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was seriously injured as a result of an accident on an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat from the "Caribbean Pirates" attraction.
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: Army prepares new assault
Children play on a charred armoured vehicle belonging to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on 31 October 2013 in eastern DRC.
On Friday, the Congolese army was preparing for a new assault on the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The goal is to dislodge the M23 from the hills that overlook Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took Bugina Hill, which overlooks Mbuzi Hill.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by herself.
Only the hill of Runyonyi will remain.
"Celle de Chanzu is not very strategic," said North Kivu governor Julien Paluku to the AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fief and the last stronghold of the rebellion, this locality is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was taken over on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred indomitables of the M23, are cut at nearly 2,000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba
In Jomba, a resident who had reported close fighting on Thursday throughout the day said the situation had been "quiet since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting of the day before and were buried.
One girl was shot and three other people were injured, one of whom was seriously evacuated by FARDC, added the witness called by AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have failed to report any loss of life.
NSA revelations increase companies' paranoia with regard to state surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital, at low altitude.
On the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media explain that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. intelligence services, again stressed in September that the U.S. does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who became a whistleblower, began to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information about the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director by word.
Reports, according to which the U.S. National Security Agency spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever sparked corporate paranoia about state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that made the vase overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence agencies and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data will be used for their mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of ILOMi, which represents German IT SMEs.
German companies believe that the US poses as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to an investigation published in July by the consulting firm EY.
However, in all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has passed on industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament said we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
"This is not the right way to do it," says Haso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we should not let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars to farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
However, the scale and sophistication of American spy agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations has been a shock to some companies that previously thought that China posed the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing since European officials have become aware that the data stored in the United States are regulated under the laws of this jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, some 10% of non-US members have given up their plans to use a US provider of cloud storage services after the revelations about the US Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says, "Our clients are asking us today a question they weren't asking us a year ago: where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been one.
"It has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Managing Director of the chemical-producing company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially, just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, in case this would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long been hammering the message that it is at least reckless to retrieve a free USB stick at a trade show or to leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the Audi car manufacturer, said that the collection of mobile phones prior to board meetings, so that they could not be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad due to the risk of harming the integrity of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access," the BfV warns in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies to economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, second-degree perpetrators of piracy of economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a well-known German company felt that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French internal intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
Parents of a Georgian teenager, who died in unusual circumstances, believe that their son was murdered
Parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found in a wrestling rug rolled in his high school gymnasium, think their son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosa, Georgia, was found on January 11 stuck in a carpet leaning upright behind the stands of his high school gymnasium.
The sheriff's investigators of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old's family disagrees with these findings.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
"They think it defies all logic, the laws of physics and the common sense," added Crump.
They are convinced that these findings were made solely for the purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag and were returned to them in a body bag," he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several important questions remained unanswered.
What's the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died by "positional asphyxia".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are several questions that still need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers evidence that could justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A judge from South Georgia ordered the authorities on Wednesday to hand over all video surveillance recordings that investigators had examined.
The adolescent's parents said they hoped that the video footage would contain clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes child allergy advice for schools
On Wednesday, the American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention issued a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies in school.
This is the first set of guidelines that the U.S. government publishes, as the number of school-age children with food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffer from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to educate teachers and staff about food allergies in children, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine – the EpiPen brand auto-injector being the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures recently updated the regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I feel something stings my tongue," "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue," or "I have tingling on my tongue."
NSA case highlights total lack of debate on intelligence
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which, on the one hand, publicly offends itself by summoning the United States ambassador on 21 October, and, on the other, forbids the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of rumours of the presence on board Edward Snowden?
In my view, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande telephones Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the ambassador of the United States, they react to a real discovery, which is that of the extent of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Isn't it surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart on the one hand the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the listenings of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't there be a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks removes the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy of political and other issues around the world, we consider that, in the eyes of American power, this is an important light.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means to outrage us with this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA concerning terrorist operations against our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American collaboration?
The introduction for roughly ten years of highly powerful interception technology tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this area, France and the United States in particular have established almost daily cooperation and information exchange procedures, which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, Mohammed Merah's presence in the tribal areas in Miranshah has been reported to the French by means of NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit whole blocks of data on the Sahel region to American services, and, in return - as has already been said - Americans can give information to French people about other regions of the world.
So the fundamental issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to acquire interception tools, but the question of the total absence of any prior debate, particularly in Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the scope that must be their own, and, ultimately, the question of infringements of freedoms.
What are the real risks to the United States of America? A deterioration of its image?
I don't know how they can be punished.
The risk to the Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest summit of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case for Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to American providers subject to US laws, and thus to the control of the NSA.
Last but not least, the vast worldwide media revelation movement, which is helping to trigger a debate on intelligence surveillance practices that have hitherto been virtually non-existent, could lead legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose "undetermined sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be attributed to them, rigidly, at birth.
Under the new Act, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to register an "undetermined" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions regarding sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, "I'm neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors created, bruised and swept away.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, the intersexuality being part of the group of about sixty diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorders, a generic term referring to people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to attribute it, and then to wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist and specialist in sexual identification issues, said the new German law "appears to be a good idea."
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual subpoena without surgery, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is in general both at the same time and not clearly defined as either.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characters (such as muscle mass, hair, chest, and stature), primary sexual characters (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs), or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and bias-motivated crimes.
Young boys of non-compliant gender now have special camps for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "neutral" after winning her appeal trial that allows her to keep an "unspecified" sex for life.
German passports will feature a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators in this landly Catholic country signed a petition for the "gender theory" to be removed from school books.
The American website Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are reversed."
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also stated on Baby Zone that she would prefer to have a sex attributed to babies at their birth.
"The role of a parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know your child's sex," she said on the young parents' website.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And just about ten years ago, the medical community considered the genre as a slate, which can be erased and on which to redraw.
But from now on, many people question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual re-assignment as he grows up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, the psychiatrist was not called, and the surgeon was called.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was initiated by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be malleable.
He enshrined the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan", his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a sloppy circumcision to castrate him entirely, also removing the testicles, and raising him as a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn't," Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors "always repeat this model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say "[that] they are not satisfied with the result."
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors could not really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
When he was 18, he suffered vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical file.
What he found horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and nobody had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, taking testosterone treatment and getting his breasts removed.
Surgery made it sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based non-profit organization Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law "calls for labelling and stigma."
"Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an "undetermined" sex," she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said his organization supported Australian law as "it allows adults to choose to be recognized as third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal genre," she added.
German law concerns the attribution of sex at birth.
It is not a battle that young children should lead at that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter suffers from a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that German law "will empower" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed female features.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today aged 29, Katie is married and interned in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
"The law leaves some latitude to parents so that they don't have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
This gives them time to do some tests and understand them, and a delay before they write "male" or "female".
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don't have to rush for an irreversible surgery.
"This puts children at the heart of the decision and alleviates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid they won't do the right thing," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and it's something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself or herself.
Letta trusting in the longevity of her government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition as the Senate vote approaches to remove Silvio Berlusconi from office.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the centre-left leader says he "firmly intends" to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax evasion in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where it has more opponents than supporters, pronounces its impeachment.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2nd by his refusal to give in to Berlusconi's injunctions that already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that a U.S. Transportation Security Agency officer, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the gunfire exchange.
Firefighters called to the scene of the drama claimed to have responded to a call for "multiple wounded".
"The police are on the spot," says the airport on its Twitter account, while television footage showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," told the AFP a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA).
ABC's local antenna showed an evacuee on a stretcher, and a second one carried on a wheelchair.
The incident occurred at approximately 9.30 a.m. local (12.30 p.m. in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that Tominals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was unable to confirm immediately whether one of his employees was injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport were suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas operative in Gaza-sces
Israeli tank fire killed an Islamist Palestinian Hamas activist on Thursday and seriously injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, reports from health services sources.
A Hamas source explained that fighting broke out in that area, as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli army merely evoked a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called a "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign regarded as dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to The New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event that appears in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's highly anticipated 2012 campaign book, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times got a copy of the book to be published and told Thursday night that the president's close collaborators had conducted "in-depth group work and polls at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's eviction could help Obama with his re-election as his hopes diminished.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House Secretary General Bill Daley, to measure how the replacement of Vice-President by former Secretary of State Clinton could affect the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely kept within the Chicago Field HQ and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisors to the president – including Daley, Obama's former campaign leader Jim Messina, and former White House advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was under consideration.
"Dual Down" says Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal ties", before finally deciding against change when figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had looked at a whole series of questions, and that was one of them," Daley told the newspaper.
Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so we thought, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley described the exam as "cooperative," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested a lot in finding out if the change would be beneficial in the election.
"The campaigns don't spend much money on polls and focus groups unless they seriously consider taking action," Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was reviewing the replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss was aware of the possible reshuffle.
Although Daley said he didn't think the president "was aware" of the eventual change, the former Secretary General admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not definitively answer the question of whether the political polls had arrived on Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama did not know that Biden's removal from the presidential list was being examined.
"Perhaps," Martin replied.
Do you want a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world's first fluorescent ice cream based on jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that, since ice cream starts to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the licker, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," said, "It's something incredible but we're still only at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g of this stuff costs about £200."
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts to shine.
We have tested it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've created because jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about £140.
But it tastes pretty good!
The Bristol-based experimental Charlie company is known for its unusual ice cream fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But its next creation looks even more ambitious.
He added, "I would really like to develop an invisible ice."
It's inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to do it.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, revealed Thursday his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for the residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died Sunday morning, as he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21st tai chi movement, with his musician's hands cracking the air," writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was master tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised her husband, the week before her death, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we're city dwellers, it's our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of life he had," she adds.
Lou Reed had undergone a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more pingled.
Over the past two years, I have not distributed a single candy and I will certainly not do it any more this year.
But the stats show that I'm the scabby sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion in candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party are the trends.
Costumes are expected to represent $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are raging.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, burgers and carrots.
As for the men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men of Daft Punk's space will figure among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought after disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with staying traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my astonishment, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans are going to spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of curious dogs dressed as hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, you don't gobble.
Americans are going to spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
That's great news for the 41 million kids who go hunting candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, don't tell us stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Manufacturers Association.
This represents about 9 billion grains of maize.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to figure out yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and this includes these amazing pictures of you peeing on that your friends put on Facebook and that you can't remove and on which a guy you like leaves a comment of the "beautiful head" style.
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and sculpting a pumpkin in the shape of a lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – it's something we've been doing since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the "baby pumpkin trend" only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these pumpkins and didn't have to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million in pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The citrouilles-lanternes that slowly wither on the porch of your house probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you're looking to get more noticed, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try sculpting their 922 kg pumpkin.
Royal Bank of Scotland will in-house create a bad bank with £38 billion (€45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to ease its relationship with London and accelerate its re-establishment.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of doubtful assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it up within three years.
RBS also said it would include a provision for depreciation of additional bad debt of £4 to £4.5 billion over the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free up £10 to £11 billion of capital, thereby strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London pointed out that the "bad bank" would make it possible to draw a line on the past, in particular as the government was accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and for the UK," the new CEO Ross McEwan told the press.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior features bucket seats and 6-point harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, a service that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support, and vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Bowler Motorsport's general manager said, "The rally fans who join Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced, some seek excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are confident that this will be a new way to try out different forms of rallies in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of raid rallies.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is really going to be exciting."
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after remaining stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornice in a quarry
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, had escaped after a gravityless road accident.
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry
Firefighters came down as a reminder along the cliff to retrieve the bitch and save her from a certain death
A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after firefighters were called to recover it safely while he was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable projection of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a road accident Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost bitch and made a call to social media sites after she disappeared in the quarry following a minor accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-sighted person walking his dog spotted Ruby on a cornice in the quarry, stuck 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station rushed to the scene and went down as a reminder to save Ruby using an animal stretcher to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical relief specialist Andy Clayton said, "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She absolutely did not move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing someone noticed the dog.
Technical rescue specialist Peter Lau said, "Ruby was very lucky to get away with it."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for inspection; his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was terrified by watching the rescue."
I didn't think she was up there at first.
It was surprising to have him back in his arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and fainted, she would probably have fallen.
Firefighters were amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely wonderful.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added, "We were afraid that she would fall, but she did not move."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never dredged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "he draped me when I was 18."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger stated that he "confirmably denies having made advances to Katy Perry."
The representative added, "Perhaps she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", landed in first place on the charts this week.
Beijing challenges Turkmen Islamic movement
"Backstage support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia," China's security organ boss told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted online Thursday night on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Communist Party of China (PCC) political bureau, spoke in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a particular organization after the attack on Monday.
According to Chinese police, three Uyghurs of the same family in the Xinjiang Muslim-dominated region, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with petrol cans against the entrance of the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that resulted in two deaths and 40 injuries.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, who claims to be fighting for the independence of Eastern Turkestan, former Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among the Al-Qaeda-affiliated organizations.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disturbances in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The Breakup of Europe Gives Choice to Scots
Another day, another disturbing history of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Movement Area in order to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's wall.
While Strathclyde's newspaper indicated the possible economic repercussions of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the headlines (and it was to be expected).
Nor has anyone said that EU Member States spend much of their time circumventing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continued non-compliance with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from the Scots.
So it's a story that's not one.
And a story so old that it is now frozen: I heard for the first time the bobard that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
Yet an interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why exchange the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at a standstill.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe officially died.
Across Europe, parties opposing the EU or advocating for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections in September and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has been a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the shackle on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments with excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has put on its members favourable exchange rates for German exporters – something German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe find themselves with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise related to productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidise French and German energy companies at the consumer's expense – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a persistent disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Not all wage freezes in the world will prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt is rumbling, especially in France, one of the EU's leading figures.
After the war, the French political elite regarded the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy struggling.
As a result, Marine Le Pen's far-right party, the National Anti-European Front, has just won a crucial by-election, sending the socialists back to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split of the right will automatically favour the left.
What is Marine Le Pen doing with his new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create a single and anti-European anti-currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties make a good appearance in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
That is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-currency feeling unique in Europe will unify and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like the free "Europe of the Nations (sovereigns)" favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will look soft in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels for a walk.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a freer European agreement provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – and it should be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour Exchequer, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent Conservative/Liberal-Democratic coalition.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Aging earlier
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter's breasts and pubic hair start growing at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr.Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young American women and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this does not indicate a rapid progress towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as breast budding, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first menstrual period over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, compared to three-quarters in 1970.
"Once the chest has started to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem".
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual appearance of puberty, but it is considered "early" when the development of the chest is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – it's something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution may justify testing by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
Treatments are available to delay the onset of early menstrual periods and prevent other consequences: premature aging of bones that can slow growth and a small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on child age, developmental rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with drugs but recognizes that "controlling puberty can alleviate some behavioral problems and the feeling for girls to be different from others."
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their period.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will deal with hygiene issues," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period at 10.
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public's attention about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study of girls aged 6 to 9 that links the percentage of fat to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate, to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on the face and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians attending the PAA conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to speak with their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected," explained Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early must be reassured that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
Tribute to the Folk of the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the 1961 Greenwich village and folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémathèque française, had picked up the Palme d'Or in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In the absence of a chance to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen cast their devolve on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the planetary pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and the songs performed live, Oscar Isaac turns out to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich roundabouts in "Gatsby the Beautiful" for less glowing clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the swearing out to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" recounts over a week the tribulations of a folk singer who can't break through and gets angry with the whole earth.
It accepts backwards the replacements at feet raised in the studios.
Without accommodation, he makes the tour of the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
An air of documentary
"His relationship with success is tortured, which is what we were interested in: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not careerist but integrated, with self-destructive behavior," Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel with several Oscars and prizes in Cannes.
While Llewyn Davis did not exist, both folk music fans filmmakers built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this neighborhood in New York called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk writes.
The film then takes on documentary looks, from the dusty music label invaded by 33T unsold inhabited by an old unsold secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen brothers still works by integrating a funny character who is constantly going through the film: a beautiful red cat with a crackling look, fortune companion of Llewyn Davis.
Asked about how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled having "grandi in Tennessee, bathed by blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is needed to "be considered good", "random can also launch someone's career", and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses any compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to be caught by anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves".
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", died.
He'll never have known the word retreat.
Phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at 83 years old, had just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times had dedicated him as "the author of spy novels who knew too much".
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theatre of the 198th and 199th installments of the famous series of spy novels.
Diminished physically by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, he was travelling on this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, ensured that he ignored the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS à Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"Undoubtedly between 120 and 150 million countries all together," he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment in a building on Foch Avenue close to the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which SAS' adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books on the coffee table between the bronzes or ivorys reported from the 130 countries surveyed to locate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional blanket with the photo of a young woman with a advantageous chest, carrying a pistol or assault rifle.
Inside, his serene altesse (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, an aristocrat Austrian with no money and a contractual agent of the CIA to pay for the repairs of the family castle, goes after all the villains of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, and then jihadists from the 90s onwards.
With each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never had the claim to be a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people I don't send a message to.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, the Albert London type, who went there and came back with real and long investigations".
SAS' father said "make a kind of geopolitical soap opera."
"I am constantly following my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those from the AFP, diplomats, people from the services I have known for some of them for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premonitories: for example, a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command centre that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Way to Damascus".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in this city, the cradle of Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Cairo Conspiracy", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he related the columns of 4X4 of jihadists that founded on the Malian capital.
I am not guessing, Gérard de Villiers defended myself, I simply make assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 daisy IBM typewriter "whose pieces have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to the pen.
On the walls of his office are hung AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machism by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always well received in Africa, where I have a lot of readers.
Gérard de Villiers had said it: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is no age".
He won't die or retire.
No more than I am.
Aircraft manufacturers quarrel over seat width while large controls are at stake
The dispute rages between major aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Air Show that takes place this month.
The conflict concerns the width of the seats proposed on long-haul flights for economy passengers – who are not always the most wooed by airlines, but to which the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but its great American rival Boeing states that it should be up to the airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as the aviators sought to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, hoping eventually for a command record at the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way the seats will be positioned at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the "mini-jumbo" segment.
Boeing states that its redesigned "777X" will accommodate in economy class 406 people in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often exchange hits on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus is calling directly to the public before the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X should take over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We were recently able to see what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept that?".
" Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft," said John Leahy, Airbus' commercial director.
As eating habits change, people grow, but seats in airplanes have not radically changed.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's Jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American weight from 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average size of the 21st century American is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival clings to a concept of seat dating back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly-named jet set was narrower.
Airbus adds that it commissioned a study that indicated that an additional inch in seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disagrees with Airbus' figures for seat width and states that it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that the cabin experience does not only depend on the width of the seats.
"It's really about providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their business," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race to order aircraft for an estimated amount of at least $700 billion at market prices in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first indicated in July, seat configuration is exactly what drives the battle between the latest aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing both claim seat-per-seat performance in their latest long-haul twin-engine models 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in unit costs is small compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
" Boeing is doing this to be able to set up more seats and make its aircraft more competitive with our products," said Kevin Keniston, Director of Comfort Passenger at the European Airbus aircraft manufacturer.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777s suggest that many passengers are in favour of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper rates.
"A seat width of 18 inches would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus' proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777," said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Aircraft vendors who travel around the world even take with them a meter to check competing configurations.
While venturing to offer comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for greater cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say it is unlikely that his call to the aviation industry to put in place a size standard for seats will succeed, but that it could make the 777X sales wave forget.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the compensation proposal for founder and general manager Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding, but it tarnishes the image of Larry Ellison, the world's third only-to-be-reaved fortune of his boat's victory at the America Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group that he co-founded 40 years ago.
Already last year, Ellison had a negative vote on his salary.
Oracle's boss waived a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended in May due to the group's poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but it collected about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is just a symbolic dollar.
Over the 2013 offset year as a whole, Oracle's net profit increased by 3.5% while the Stock Exchange price jumped by 27.5%, overperforming the S&P-500 index which took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotin vaccine could suppress the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
Only one dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice for life from nicotine dependence.
Further tests are needed before starting testing on the human being, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from having his dose of nicotine.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice to which nicotine was subsequently given continued their normal activity.
But mice that had not been vaccinated "were appeased," the researchers said, indicating that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines were found to be ineffective because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be repeated so frequently that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it transforms liver cells into antibody plants.
Professor Crystal said if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't take any fun because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but pointed out that much more research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike on Friday in Pakistan, was learned from the security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been repeatedly announced in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the activist movement this time claimed that he lost his life in this strike, carried out in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security official.
The previous day, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, informed the British government that discussions had begun with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied changing the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to determine whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeid own two restaurants and a coffee shop, after they expired in August 2005, without a call for tenders.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former Deputy Secretary General, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
In the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government has lobbied for a tender for leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the leases for Circular Quay's companies, which reported to the Obeid approximately $2.5 million per year, were renewed without a call for tenders.
Mr Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, admitted Mr. Tripodi, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to ICAC showed appeals made in August and September 2007 between Mr.Obeid, Mr.Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under Mr.Obeid at the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the subject discussed during these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy?" Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheaty asked Tripodi.
"No," Mr. Tripodi replied.
I don't remember what we talked about, but it wasn't that.
At least not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, says official
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, says a military official at Fox News.
The official did not specify the target, but said that there was at least one target.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a "authenticity" test.
The Government is currently exploring the possibility of introducing a "authenticity test" for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while considering extending the repressive measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied on the basis of a criterion intended to prevent visas 457 from being used for unskilled positions or as a diverted means of bringing family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's discourse on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"The shocking statements about "foreigners returning to the end of the line" and "jobs for Australians first" are an unpleasant comeback at a time when unions were demanding a protected labour market," she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the whites had to be protected – and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion paper outlines the 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, with the others being reviewed.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for "whether the job offer is genuine if the applicant is a personal relationship or partner of the owner or the person concerned within the sponsoring company".
Companies may also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The panicked 9-year-old man's son was traveling to Australia with him and has found some comfort since his father's death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A study to multiply the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start from the start of Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said the project "would bring the United Kingdom together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will cover a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government increased the estimated cost of constructing the high-speed link between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of journey times for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."
We push the HS2 project because the benefits are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a problem of capacity in our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to support "undoubtedly" Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight into the overall high-speed rail network project across Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK government to explore options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps."
Rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being.
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the United States' move to relax electronic device regulations.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases provided they are in "airplane" mode.
Passengers can already do so for most of the flight, but many people find it difficult to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision that requires U.S. carriers to perform significant work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was reviewing the announcement but pointed out that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in effect in Australia.
"CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft," she said.
The issue is the subject of regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure the continued maintenance of safety and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already spoken to CASA about her intention to expand the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a revision of CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe that this would improve the customer experience now that we have (the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our planes," said one spokesperson.
Qantas stated that it is currently complying with the current rules.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
The FAA's decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA's decision and its reasons.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will be required to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs and instructions provided to passengers.
"As soon as an airline has checked its fleet's tolerance, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stowed under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four injured in a violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a gathering of about 30 people according to the testimonies gathered...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a fight involving several people broke out on the side of the Post Office.
At least four light injuries are reported.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore pledge lenders take advantage of middle classes forced to tighten belt
At a pawn shop in Bendemeer, Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay the tuition fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, became this week the third pledge loan company to be introduced on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Placing jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Mrs.Amirthalinga – but it's almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, secured lenders in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local funder with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawn lenders have the advantage of not asking for credit check or proof of salary, and can release loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the pressure of rising costs of living and the over-indebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by too lax a monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to pawnshops to make up for the difference as their economies slow down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency cited growing household debt, mainly as a result of rising mortgage lending, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has just emerged this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the wage scale] are looking to supplement their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have made people hasten to hire their personal belongings to earn the cash value of their jewellery.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items pledged in the city-state's 200 pawnshops are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's pledge Grandma's gold chain and we'll come back for it next month."
In Thailand, the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months.
The increase is such in the bond lending sector that ValueMax, the store's operator in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its general manager.
The company will fund them using 60% of Singapore's $66 million raised this week during its introduction to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have been criticized for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Miss Yeah indicates that the pledge not only offers lower rates than the other lenders, but also does not directly increase the debt.
"Customers mortgage property they already own, and monetizing their personal property does not increase household debt," she says.
Engagement is becoming increasingly socially accepted as a means of securing guaranteed funding in the short term.
The people who go to pawnshops are not only those who have financial problems.
The affluent people of Singapore also go to ValueMax pawnshops to pawn gold ingots or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all walks of life.
"They can be wealthy people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investments, or small businesses that have cash flow needs to go through a difficult course," adds Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor charged with child pornography in Nova Scotia
A youth pastor in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is charged with child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor officiated, said it was deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials indicate that Mr. Hudgens resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it should not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and should not have access to the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being driven out of it.
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barred from a armband with the swastika was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complaining to the management of the establishment that called the police, said the store on Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesperson for the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to rescue her, but "by the time she arrived, he had already gone without a break," she added.
I was in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were mouth-to-mouthed.
"You don't go out on the street unless you want to get attention," said 60-year-old client Rosina Rusin at Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, Halloween Day, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a hoax.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS armband twice a week for three years at Asda," said Paul Dutton, explaining suffering from "mental problems".
$325M Rescue Plan for Tasmania's Health System
The federal government maintains that the $325 million rescue plan for the vagrant health care system has strict conditions to ensure that the government of the state will not waste funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to end a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The funding, which is planned for four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmania's independent MP, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The $325M plan includes a $31M campaign for non-emergency surgical operations.
2,600 additional operations, particularly in the field of orthopaedic surgery and cataracts, will help to catch up.
Funding is also provided for non-attendance clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved external care, training of medical officers, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, this is the best way to treat Tasmania's health system," said Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Tasmania government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The government will need to maintain current funding levels to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on areas where it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the government provides services in the most efficient and effective manner possible.
Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much "unless it is followed by a real reform to strengthen Tasmania's public health system."
However, he commended the government for responding to the request for urgent assistance that it made to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope the federal aid plan will go a long way in removing Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesperson Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "rich solution".
"The reason we're here is that the state Labour government has withdrawn $430 million from its health care system," he said on ABC TV.
We can't have a state government that rips out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts $300 million, and pretend it's a great day.
Mr Dutton visited Mrs Plibersek to ensure that no dollar in the rescue plan would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicolux of Denis Diderot's novel boasts a remarkable artistic direction and a meticulous reconstruction of the period, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Taking place in France in the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebelled, she faced the unlimited cruelty of one Mother Superior deliberately sadistic and became an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pours into lubricity or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of narration could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons, says the monitoring body
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, said the international chemical weapons monitoring body on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country almost 3 years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived one day in advance of the deadline for the
1 November set by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or "unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machines for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is estimated that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made as fighting raged Thursday in the city of Safira which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights based in Great Britain.
The group of activists, following the evolution of the human balance sheet through a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
It is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces were killed, of whom 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Of the deaths, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated this figure since then.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
Al-Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom have been linked to al-Qaeda groups in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not give any details.
The fighting highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they have to complete their mission of ridding Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a continuing civil war, within tight deadlines.
A statement by the OPCW, working closely with the UN, indicated that its team was "now satisfied with having controlled – and seen destroyed – all declared critical production and machinery for mixing and filling."
She added that "no other inspection activities were planned at this time."
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPCW said that the two sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and...that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
"I salute the moral strength and courage you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of al-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the sentence imposed on one of the Bali bombers
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence handed down against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a firing squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in manufacturing the explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass killing for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which resulted in the deaths of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many injuries.
He was also convicted of many other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have requested a life sentence, yet they could have requested that the man, who was described as "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in bomb manufacturing, be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the brink of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"It should be dragged in front of the firing squad," Ms. Corteen told the PAA.
I have to live every day without having any other grandchildren, or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He sank into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he "dead" three times while under respiratory assistance.
Hugues said Patek should have known the same fate as the three other members of Jemaah Islamiyah's terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
To spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces will kill former Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in order to re-establish links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't surrender," added Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he was making fun of the grief he had caused to others.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of crying this year," said Ms. Corteen.
However, Patek may appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their mobile phones – under the much-anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will be required to demonstrate to the FAA that their aircraft are complying with the new guidelines and that they have updated the crew training manuals and the aircraft storage rules to be in compliance.
FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"Based on the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to turn them on until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives its green light.
Passengers are expected to turn off their aircraft when the aircraft is lowered before landing and not turn them on until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground rolling, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was pleased with these changes.
"Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers for this – it will benefit everyone," Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room overseers" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and text messages or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will need to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in air mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the online game Scrabble style played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was evicted loudly from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the aircraft was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stowed because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones rests with the Federal Communications Commission and not with the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered to be at risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could eventually create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if used on board," said Rosenker.
An industry advisory committee established by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government allow for wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on its use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there are no valid security reasons for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their aircraft, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the then high-tech gadget.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand FAA-approved electronic interference.
Airlines have allowed their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
e-book readers, for example, only issue minimal transmissions when you turn a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those who are lobbying for a relaxation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders loaded a line plane with Kindle e-book readers and had it fly to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee to have mixed feelings about whether or not the use of the devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought the interference from the aircraft was real, although the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A group in the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling for meaningful arrangements for technologically equipped travellers.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicopter bird from a platform in the North Sea was released into the wild
A bird, helitrated after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, was released into the wild.
The water rail was boarded in a helicopter towards Aberdeen last month before it was put back on foot by the Scottish SPCA in its Alloa Rescue Centre.
The centre's director, Colin Seddon, said, "This water rail was probably a wintering migratory who came from northern Europe and found himself caught in the midst of strong winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil rig.
He added, "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help."
The water rail was healthy when released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing companies together and defining what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do so, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 entrepreneurs, broadly representative of all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arcanes.
When asked about specific policy issues – ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws – the majority of entrepreneurs believe that control of these key competencies should return to Westminster.
The single market has caused general dissatisfaction, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area – 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and more importantly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based relationship with the EU, not politics.
This conclusion, which can be found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a "significant change" that restores power to the UK.
The stakes are high – achieving a change in the treaty and better representing Britain's interests would make it possible to see a 16% shift in votes in favour of maintaining the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible and increasingly necessary to better represent the interests of British companies, since the euro area is embarking on a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means re-focusing on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States in Halloween Colors
In the United States, President Obama did not depart from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed treats to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the partymen have made up for each other.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the Greenwich village district.
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the suit I had planned last year.
We're having fun like crazy, Rhonda adds.
People are happy.
It's good kid, it's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated on the eve of All Saints, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says Bulgaria gas pipeline inaugurates new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said Gazprom Director.
"A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project," said Alexei Miller, CEO of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine, through which most of the Russian gas destined for Europe passes, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct junction to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever."
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into service in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, the daily newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti announced on Thursday, featuring information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory is 47 km2, with three other small islands nearby.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the mutinies of Bounty, an episode in the history of the English navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutineers, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends 95% on the generosity of London.
The Island Council unanimously voted in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, i.e. 836,000 km2, which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy to the mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the Mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The establishment of such a marine reserve would enable the United Kingdom to safeguard these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it had the means to monitor them, which was not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to surveillance of the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance vessels.
As for France, it must already conduct the very expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian EEZ, neighbouring Pitcairn.
The FAA is relaxing restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on aircraft – but it will always be forbidden to make calls on mobile phones.

Life imprisonment for former Chinese vice governor
A former vice governor of Jilin Province, in northeastern China, was sentenced Friday to life imprisonment for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having hit more than 19 million yuan in bribes, Chinese official media reports.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice governor, who was also the president of the Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped businesses and officials get contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, said Beijing's first intermediate court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, considering that the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the Head of State promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "mishes" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were convicted, among them former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most dramatic recent case was that of the former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest positions in the state.
But the government has not shown any intention of reforming the anti-corruption system, for example by setting up an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault as a result of allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two New South Wales YMCA employees were charged with sexual assaults on children following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it "had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization."
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education instructor of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but that he was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate by pointing out, "external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that the safety of children was a top priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst ratings on four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities carried out in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that personnel management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they were required to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum prison term of six years.
But Mr Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA had a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failures to protect children.
The staff members testified that they had observed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that he kept them in private, that they sat on his lap, that he loved them, and that he let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was under Lord's guidance and had requested training in child protection because she was concerned about her behaviour, said she found YMCA Caringbah's child services manager, Jacqui Barnat, who framed Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General stated that he rejected staff testimony that they were reluctant to report these deficiencies to their supervisor.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relations they had with Lord clouded their judgment, causing them to fail to report his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his views before the New South Wales YMCA Council that, for the organization, the lesson learned from "the Jonathan Lord incident" should not concern "reporting" by staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were raised, was made by YMCA Director General for Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence, but that it was an "excess of zeal" and that it had been misimplemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, i.e. between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on child sexual abuse, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, monitoring, induction, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but recognizes that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office, the 59-year-old made his opinion known on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade of leadership, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair would have replied, according to London's Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but it can probably happen, so..."
When many equestrian event experts gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old, to win.
Not yet in school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the toddler and his pony Shetland Toffee trotted during the three rounds with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – which are of the same size – were praised for the presentation, attitude and style at the annual contest held at Sunnybank Equestrian Center, in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting himself against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side in a casual way to scroll his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his unusual natural qualities of dressage for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good grades for her presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has since trained with his Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffee make an excellent duet."
They showed up against each other, but both took the gold cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were crazy about the joy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in southern Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has participated in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Howells said, "There was electricity in the air and everyone was encouraging and applauding it."
He ran all along the track and even though he seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
From the way he started, he will surely soon take part in the Horse of the Year event – and I'm sure he'll do a great performance.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian event said, "Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee presented well and how they marched on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he looked really proud.
A Chinese newspaper that has issued an appeal "will be reworked"
A Chinese newspaper that has launched a front-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be reworked, says a press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based New Express issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now the New Express is going to undergo a "complete overhaul," said the regulator.
The order of "reshuffle" comes from the Guangdon administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"New Express's writing was disorganized," said the regulator in a statement.
He indicated that he had decided "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card".
He also "ordained the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete reshuffle of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into those responsible at New Express and immediately remake the newspaper's management team".
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express on alleged financial irregularities of a construction machine manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a front-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing fake stories for money.
"In this case, I harmed Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told the CCTV public television network.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express released his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several important suspects have recently made televised confessions.
Specialists say that people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier in the year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is on the run.
The radioactive vapour leak detected on one of Charles de Gaulle's two nuclear boilers in mid-October and while the boat was at sea, was "safe for sailors", but is not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royale has confirmed that the ship is "unavailability" until "mid-November", "the time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, DCNS, a defence naval specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "currently intervene on the aircraft carrier".
For them, among other things, it is a question of changing a pump on the defective boiler.
"Every effort is being made to ensure that the Charles de Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013," DCNS explains.
And the National Navy certifies that "it does not in any way call into question the vessel's activity program" with nuclear propulsion.
Recall that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier is coming out of a six-month interim maintenance period.
He had flown from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, with a view to qualifying young fighter pilots.
A "small damage", confined to the reactor containment space, had then occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a great displeasure on the part of the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, deluge of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs not to be finished.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dilapid dollars could be saved to allow a tax that is very respectful of those who pay.
Any money forcibly taken from taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no problem with lavish spending and the maintenance of lame ducks: a deficit cultural centre, a high subsidy to the Cité de l'Énergie, etc.
If these facilities are not cost-effective, sell them to the private enterprise or demolish them.
It is also gratifying to note the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honourable mention to the transformation of the former Wabasso into a sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost to tax payers?
It is not at the public level to invest in such enterprises, but at the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that the fishing lakes and the Batteries will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water users) and the large decline in the population, water use has declined significantly throughout the country.
Without meaning to waste it, the city will never run out of water and the severe regulation of its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We've been managed for over 40 years by ties with great degrees for the most part and I don't think a sheep breeder is doing any worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, was discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 4-foot by 3-foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzaging along a length equivalent to nearly six long football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, United States.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, making it easy to conceal trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out by passing unnoticed, the authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They shall be sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment and to life imprisonment if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate large underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major crossing discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, thus posing a challenge for drug cartels to quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railway tracks that left the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two San Diego warehouses.
British police issue extradition warrant against Assange
British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "dismissal notice" against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not do so, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June, asking that South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asks him to report to a police station, on the date and time of his choice," said a spokesperson.
He continues to violate the conditions of his bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of spying, having unveiled more than 250,000 American diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting against secret information.
How biometrics will invade our lives
No more passwords to type to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French and Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy general manager of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person performing transactions in a universe as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this passion for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
In 2011 alone and in France, the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the form of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified anywhere and anytime," says Justin Brookman, who is responsible for consumer privacy at the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques that will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people who work concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the domain of identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand presuppose a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
It is both a security - we cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been conducted over the past 20 years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the coloured part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased accuracy of sensors and the computing capacity of computers needed for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has increased tenfold over the past five years, says Cyrille Bataller, Director of Accenture's R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today, we're researching voice recognition or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sridhar Iyengar, Intel Lab Security Research Director.
A unique and tamper-proof marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, CNIL's Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective Studies.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers the criminal investigation services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in one hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is the person they claim to be).
Identification has so far concerned the issue of identity papers: biometrics (fingerprints, photos, iris) must be compared with the information the State has on all citizens already registered.
This ensures that a person does not attempt to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance to a hotel or store.
"We collect the images from surveillance cameras and compare them to the photos of celebrities who circulate freely on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, who is responsible for the commercial development of biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Other use: take a picture of a quidam waiting in a store, track his progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens...) or logical access (opening of a computer).
More recently, presence control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend pointing for another," explains Cyrille Bataller of Accenture.
But, more and more, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing his card and placing his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the typing of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by Natural Security in partnership with banks and retail chains: when paying in-store with its bank card, the customer does not type his code, but inserts his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French traders.
Tracks to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in the case thirty seconds less, it's appreciable," explains the manager of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you customized options.
And, finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"The fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure case, which is blocked if one tries to move it," lists Philippe Robin, of Thales.
But, because of the lack of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Privacy experts continue to be concerned.
"The progress of facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance," predicts Andrew Patrick of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was given an almond of £1,000.
A motorist was fined £1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree in the Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 up to Braintree on 27 May.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to take between his legs.
At the Court of First Instance in Colchester, Howie admitted the conduct offence without the necessary prudence and attention.
The seven points removed from his licence led to a 6-month licence withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of £90 and a victim surcharge of £100.
A tax on foreign homeowners to blow up the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision by Mr.Osborne who, in Budget 2012, entered a stamp duty of 7% for properties costing more than £2 million and annual fees for purchasers who choose to own properties under a corporation rather than individually.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea boroughs, and represents £708 million in the 2012/13 fiscal year, exceeding the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber region combined.
Cook said: "With the increase in stamp duty on high value properties and the introduction of anti-avoidance legislation in this area, it is very difficult to argue that high value properties are underimposed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
Prestigious real estate – the 5–10% of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the thriving southwest London sector stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but have been overshadowed by a growing "internal market", with the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) recovering, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog's tail are related to his mood.
Previous studies had shown that happy dogs moved their tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs moved it more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "Everyone knows that, in man, the left and right sides of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what was happening in other species.
He added that just as in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disordered tail movements of other dogs, researchers followed animals watching movies with other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behaviour.
It probably won't take long before we understand why their tails sometimes go on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We presented to dogs films featuring other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factor – and we were able to tamper with the movement of the tail and present it as going further left or right."
When the animals saw a dog without expression moving the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog shaking the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail drifting mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog shaking the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, he thinks that dogs know from experience what movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you encounter other dogs repeatedly and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience."
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Canine Behavior John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, indicated that this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University discovered that the dogs were turning their heads to the left when they were looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said, "The dogs were more easily going to a robot dog when its tail was moving to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what is in the Italian study."
He indicated that the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
"Although there are many elements from different mammals that indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why their tails sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpones concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert to Glasgow after his singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
Sheffield's band was scheduled to perform Friday in the downtown The Hydro concert hall.
However, his laryngite forced singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the band was forced to similarly postpone a concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after asking for medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show to the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1st."
"Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the show at the Glasgow Hydro will take place on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.
Please contact customer service at the ticket office where you purchased your tickets for any additional help.
Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer take part in the election of a pope – this therefore amounts to a group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting bringing together all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony at which bishops would be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as the Consistory.
"Pope Francis decided to communicate his decision to convene the Consistory of February in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal voters will likely have decreased.
He said that a pope usually appointed as many cardinals as he needed to get the number of cardinal voters to 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
Next year's consistory will be important because it will be the first since Pope Francis' election in March of this year, Valero said.
For the time being, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will name cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world to examine ways of reforming the church.
Previously, the pope decided on his own.
"From now on, François chose these eight cardinals to help him," explained Valero.
He added that it was "very possible" for Francis to seek advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is totally new.
Valero indicated that the popes generally raised bishops representing vast communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was "full of surprises – so we don't know who he will name".
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair seat back
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to solve a problem with manually tiltable records, according to a Friday statement by the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a defect in the tilt mechanism.
As a result, the records do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is struck from the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, thus increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) site.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the first U.S. car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the newsletter to owners due to the 16-day shutdown of government operations, which slowed down vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM's stock price climbed 1.4% to reach $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks on Thursday afternoon in Montreal.
The drama occurred at approximately 11:00 a.m. on Marquette Street, close to the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the borough of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations had been going on there for some time.
A adjoining foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the site in order to recover his tools.
I was driving by and saw the wall crumble with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who remains close to the construction site.
I came down and went to take off the big bricks that covered him.
You could only see part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is a man in his 50s who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation manoeuvres were attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man didn't survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was sent to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
The cry of despair of an Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says Obama has made commendable efforts foiled by the obstructionism of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard's Faculty of Medicine.
I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the gloomy second year of medicine and give me hope.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and is the memoirs of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients' medical reports at night and went to bed, this book took me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and where speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and newscasters took time to reflect on the historic nature of the moment.
My comrades wept with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries advanced to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before taking office in 2008, he had 82% favourable views.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years after the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure from Iraq of our army, through the end of the "neither seen nor known" and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the areas of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after having repeatedly defended Obama's administration in front of my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I'm on the brink of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
She cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the government's wrongs.
It cannot justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without trial, nor the escape of public funding and the overrun of authorized spending during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the White House's efforts to silence the media are the "most aggressive... since the Nixon administration".
And, more recently, she cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Of course, the election function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unsophisticated alternative that did not seem to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we had heard about for so long.
However, while the favourable opinion index has dropped below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He makes me want the many promises that have gone away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton at the Pennsylvania Primarys.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
We're five years later, Mr. President, and I don't agree with you anymore.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, did not wear a helmet.
Despite the rapid response of the relief workers, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from this system.
The mining magnate, contesting the payment of a carbon tax in the amount of $6 million, argued this argument in an attempt to rule out issues relating to a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be removed.
But Mr Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr Abbott's daughters were willing to benefit personally from these policies.
"There will be a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying for parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets parental leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the election commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr Palmer put forward the idea of a reshuffle of the system of counting votes to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your contact information on a computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6:30 a.m. the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballot papers.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission had considered options for electronic voting and had recently issued a joint concept paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new duties "very seriously."
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We're not looking for a reward, except the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, responsible for scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marine Environments (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Are you surprised at the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin?
This is good news, but I am not particularly surprised.
If in the past the species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge in science of species classification.
It is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are being questioned due to advances in genetics.
Similarly, two very morphologically close species were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
About ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have distinguished four species.
Why is this an important discovery, as the Wildlife Conservation Society has stated?
From a conservation perspective, knowledge of these genetic differences is essential to protect the species and thus its genetic variability.
While this population had long been known to researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only there.
Therefore, if there is a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than with a local disappearance of a population of a species that is more widespread on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered based on the number of individuals on Earth, that is, the stock, and the possibility of recovery from nearby stocks.
With respect to the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new discovered species has emerged, its stock has automatically become smaller, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This brewing of genes limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, than to know what lives in the Mariannes pit, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent on searching for life on other planets than on marine research and it is high time it changed.
RBS suspends two traders on the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division according to two sources close to the file, again showing that the regulators' global investigation into suspicions of currency market manipulations is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where US$5.3 trillion change hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the scandal of manipulations of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this matter is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file stated that RBS had sent instant email and message files to and from a former trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European cash trading manager for currency at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European head of cash exchange trading at Citi, was laid off this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and from bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, added sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it had brought an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, stated that it was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
Around the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining allegations about bankers who have agreed to manipulate rates in the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, reported sources close to the file.
Banks peel instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
News about these investigations has rocked traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest engines of growth of investment bank trading units in recent years, but that has been questioned this year due to low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast, highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at little cost."
The news came the same day Credit Suisse announced that it had sent a trader working in its London Stock Exchange trading office this week after it caused a $6 million loss at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case has been mastered," said a representative of Crédit Suisse.
Mayor Rob Ford's investigation has been sloppy, says lawyer
After police confirmed that they had got their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby argued that he had never seen an investigation "so sloppy".
Ruby told The Canadian Press that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's 35-year-old friend and occasional driver Alexander Lisi and accused him of extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police also reported observing this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Ruby described as "unexplainable" the fact that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or tapped his phone, arguing that police chief Bill Blair knowingly chose not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and carried out a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash described Mr Ruby's remarks as "obvious and desperate attempt" to make himself known to the media in a case that does not concern him in any way.
In a press conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair claimed that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" for filing a criminal charge against the mayor.
European stock exchanges down at mid-meeting, except London
With the exception of London, the main European stock exchanges are moving down on Friday at mid-term, with some disappointing company news, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
On the other hand, investors remain cautious as they believe that the US Federal Reserve could unwind its policy of quantitative easing earlier than expected.
On the other hand, after the announcement of inflation at 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spreading among market participants that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
Wall Street's futures suggest an opening up of US shares, after two consecutive retreat sessions.
At values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the biggest drop in the CAC 40, led by the result warning of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) is the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, having also released declining results this morning and announced the creation of a bad bank with 38 billion pounds of riskiest assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the top of the EuroFirst300 increases in response to press reports that AT&T is studying a possible takeover.
On the foreign exchange market, speculation on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy is well under way, as evidenced by Saxo Bank's strategist, John Hardy.
The ECB's single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for the euro to fall.
In this context, the euro continues to fall against the US currency and has reached a two-week low of $1.3517.
These same assumptions support the euro area bond market on the contrary.
Supreme Court Validates Obama's Health System Reform Act
Great victory for the Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court today declared that Obama's ratified health system reform law was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to subscribe to health insurance by 2014, on pain of having to pay a fine – and stated that it was constitutional under the government's taxing power.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court also validated the remaining sections of the 2,700-page Act and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered if it is not possible to lose all federal funding for the program, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
Proceedings to block the law were initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates in the 2012 presidential election, including nominated candidate Mitt Romney, fiercely opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to veterans in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and deceased of all wars.
Sheaves were laid in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by MP Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Tightening between Palestinians and Israelis on the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured in the evening of Thursday, October 31, 2013, during a violent clash on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory in a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip stopped operating on Friday, 1 November, after a depletion of its fuel stocks, the Energy Authority of the Palestinian enclave announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another Hamas military-terrorist operative, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell fire during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younes, in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local Al-Qassam Brigade officials, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were later discovered.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armoured bulldozer made an incursion of about 100 metres inside the territory and then withdrew.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zuhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had died during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the Al-Qassam heroes who fell defending the territory during an incursion by the Zionist occupier in Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas is confident that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," the spokesman threatened.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, for “terrorist activities”.
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight against Israel, stating that the purpose was to abduct Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, an Israeli military statement explained.
During the operation, Hamas set off an explosive device targeting IDF forces (the Israeli army) and wounded five soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," said army spokesman Peter Lerner.
In addition, Israel struck an air force base in north-western Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles to the Lebanese Shia Hezbollah movement, reported on Thursday, 31 October, the satellite channel Al-Arabiya.
An American official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not give details about the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he added.
Officials of the Israeli government refused to confirm any information concerning such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that it has not named, the Saudi capital chain reported that "the bombing targeted a shipment of surface-to-air missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", in reference to the powerful Lebanese Shia movement fighting rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions heard at dawn on Wednesday at an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents Danse Danse with her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by Henri Michaux's inks and poems, the second inspired by Satie's famous piano solos Gymnopédies.
An evening that allows you to see the whole prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and from ink black to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Théâtre Maisonneuve, progresses, in profile, fine as a line and clothed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, simple stroke, takes its form.
And this form will be that of the whole room: an enfilade of physical imitations of drawings.
The dancers, entirely dressed in black, only the hands and face discovered, wait on either side of the playground, rush when the next graphic appears, incarnate it, come out running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made as a relay of solos, as a group in unison (a mass that does solo), as a large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
One thinks of "Gloire du matin", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, placed online at the forestage.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is strong, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rhythm is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux' poem, monocorde and monotonous in the auction, and will continue while dancing.
And the music to leave, and the sequence to resume.
This loud and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up deafening and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are a few beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - like those hairs that are dazzling or those black fabrics that extend the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux' work, has established herself, with her tics.
The result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux inks, like Gestalt forms, open a broader and giboyous imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers chopped by a strobe light and white signs in a suddenly black theatre, touches magic.
The audience liked it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopedias, after the intermission, is richer.
The scene is partly draped with grey, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a forsaken house.
On the piano, dancers take turns to play the scores.
Their clumsiness in music, touching, gives a real fragility.
On stage, pass couples, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving ensembles, choirs, writing is less binary.
Fogs appear, also familiar to Chouinard, with a red nose, in very polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnassiers, runaways or players.
The gestures, the laughter and the little cries beautifully translate the archaic, the grace and the ridiculousness of the bodies into coitus, beings that melt.
But the play takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back on stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the universes explored superimpose, the dancers cabotine, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, spread the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness transpire, and it is Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are being sued for Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents began an avalanche of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that it capped at the pole during the patent auction that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the United States Assize Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that make it possible to display advertising in relation to search terms on the Internet, said the outcome of the trial, which is the core business of Google.
It was not possible to reach representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that operate under Google's Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for an amount of $12.5 billion, a market partly based on Motorola's patent library.
"Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at issue during the auction, it violated and continues to violate those patents," said the outcome of the trial.
Rockstar claims greater damages against Google, as it claims that Google's patent violation is obstinate, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother reportedly lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a home in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a faulty water heater, said Friday night the King's Attorney's Substitute.
The expert sent on site by the parquet ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette when there was a leak and a build-up of gas.
The vital prognosis of both victims is still engaged.
The grandmother was thrown by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was at his side and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on site before being taken to the CHU in Liège, she by helicopter, him by ambulance," said the mayor José Paulet, who went down to the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase remained intact while the rear wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the nearby house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the CPAS.
Firefighters from Andenne and Namur and the Arches police intervened.
Crisnée's civil protection has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks the first freely elected president to take the oath
Mohamed Morsi took the oath of investiture, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he took the oath of investiture to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was driven out of power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the Constitutional High Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of State of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before the 18 judges in the Court's black robe whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to better tomorrows, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal and harshly repressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the Court to acclaim the new president and, standing out from the presidential fascination of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy into the busy streets connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
Considered the Muslim Brotherhood's uncharismatic "rescue wheel", his personal prestige has grown considerably since his victory and his Friday speech in which he tried to run as the candidate not only for Islamists but for all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian president Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges present in the room adorned with woodwork where he was sworn in.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he delivered his inauguration speech.
He was officially greeted by a military band that played the national anthem as he stood guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand..." toned by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheatre of the university.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a fief of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, from which the uprising that put an end to Mubarak's authoritarian regime last year started, and vowed to recover the presidential powers from which the military council, which replaced the former ousted president, dispossessed him.
But by accepting to take an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Morsi's speech at Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
Shutdown in the USA has slowed the growth of the automotive market
The 16-day closure of most federal administrations weighed on the growth in car sales in the United States in October, shows the figures released Friday by manufacturers, with five of the top six having achieved performance below expectations.
Detroit's three major manufacturers show double-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors has done better than expected.
Analysts forecast an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales, but the market was estimated to be 15.3 million according to Morgan Stanley's analyst Adam Jonas.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight brake is primarily due to "the government's 'shutdown' and its impact on the consumer's feeling during the first half of the month".
GM nevertheless reported an increase of almost 16% in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands saw their business performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit, among other things, from the success of its pickups, saw its sales grow by 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus awaited 194,301.
For its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also posted below-consensus sales, despite year-over-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, the GM share won 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford yielded 1.1%.
Renault Leaded on the Stock Exchange by Nissan's Warning
On Friday, Renault has the biggest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced that it has reduced its annual net profit forecast by almost 20%, traders report.
Nissan, who had to carry out such a review, also announced a reshuffle of its management.
Several traders reported that the Renault action was affected this morning by the "warning".
"It's clearly Nissan's profit-warning," said a trader in Paris.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to data from Nissan's website.
Greece: Two dead in shooting near neo-Nazi party premises
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night by gunshots fired by two people on a motorcycle passing in front of a premises of the Golden Dawn neo-Nazi party in the western suburbs of Athens, police sources have reported.
The police were not at present able to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had argued that the victims were guards from their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers from the anti-terrorist service dispatched to the central avenue of the suburb of Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident occurred a few weeks after the indictment of six deputies from Golden Dawn, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in "a criminal organization" as part of an offensive against that party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal dismissed
Scott Brown, the Celtic Glasgow captain, saw his call rejected and will be well suspended for his club's next two Champions League matches, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expulsion against the Barça for hitting Neymar, the Scottish community saw its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed", believing that his appeal was entirely justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes are without electricity throughout the province, shortly after noon on Friday, due to high winds in many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The sectors most affected are the Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the dark, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The greater Montreal area is also experiencing its share of outages with nearly 7,000 private power homes in the metropolis and Laval.
You thought travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be reversing the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecast upwards and hopes for record results thanks to vacationers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects to realize an underlying profit over the entire fiscal year between $325 million and $340 million before taxes, compared to a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If the current forecast is met, this will represent 12 to 17% growth over the record $290.4 million achieved in 2011/12.
Managing Director Graham Turner stated that Flight Centre had made 8% profits in the first half of the year and that the second half of the year had started in strength, particularly with respect to non-business travel to Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and several of them are on track to achieve record results for the entire fiscal year before deducting interest and taxes," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the biggest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half of the year, compensating for a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the United Kingdom, Flight Centre's leisure travel sector performed well while business customers spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses in the first half of the year when seasonal demand was lower and was expected to profit for the third consecutive year as a whole.
Flight Centre shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown shooting at hotel near Cairo pyramids
Unknown hooded people opened fire this Friday on a hotel near the Cairo pyramids in Egypt without causing casualties, the result of an apparent quarrel with dismissed employees.
The attackers fled, said the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, police general Abdel Latif.
This attack comes at a time when Egypt no longer receives almost any tourists since the army removed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and repressed the demonstrations of its supporters in blood.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English literature classes, students will have to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage a more diverse reading.
A course combining English and literature will be deleted.
Starting in 2015, students will have to pass an independent GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is to publish tomorrow its new English and math programs – the raw materials to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other core areas next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Board of Examiners, will unveil a redesign of the GCSE structure, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking over the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was "a broad consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence," stressing that the GCSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and Singaporean students do about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of in-depth math – as well as the greater emphasis on subjects in international rankings – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of classes.
The program will place greater emphasis on "real world problems", including financial mathematics.
This ruling means that a law adopted in July in that State and widely challenging the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An octagenary welcomes children with a rifle at the Muy for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 were door-to-door asking for candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy neighbourhood visited by the children opened the door by holding his shotgun.
The old man, aged 86, explained to the gendarmes that he had been afraid.
His gun's been seized.
Former Gestapo chief buried in Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without his trace ever being found, was actually buried in a mass graveyard of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says German Resistance Memorial leader Professor Johannes Tuchel in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave at the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he assured the daily wide circulation using archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would answer one of the great riddles of the Afterwar.
The German secret services, the BND, provided as well as in the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were totally wrong.
"From August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando", according to Tuchel.
He was wearing "a general's uniform."
"In the left inner pocket were notably his service records with a photo," he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from the district town hall of the Mitte district in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the neighborhood.
The president of the Central Council of Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, expressed shock at this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormity of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is being grossly trampled with their feet," he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the prominent figures of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had notably under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

It walks in mud, jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroon villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect him "CNN Heroes of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of conscience and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma whose sequelae he would carry the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr.Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could benefit from.
"It's not easy," says Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, walk to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr.Bwelle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians would not be able to pay for the consultation.
Two in five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the country's health spending is in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," said Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr.Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed over 700 free surgical procedures over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaoundé.
And it has established a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas during weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about 30 people, they pile up in vans after fixing the medical equipment on the roof and crossing difficult terrain to get to the villages most in need of help.
Chance doesn't always follow them.
They have had to push vehicles many times to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodations available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to party, and Dr.Bwelle – with his great smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began receiving hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people each time we visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this itinerant hospital, various health care services are provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team practices simple surgical procedures under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, town hall or house; after the surgery, the patient rises and goes to the waking room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr.Bwelle and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning.
It's an exhausting rhythm, but village musicians usually help the team stay motivated.
"They hit drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working," said Mr. Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgical procedures free of charge over the past year, and knows that their presence can make all the difference for those they help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"This will change my future and that of my family," said the man.
In addition to supporting this travelling hospital and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Dr.Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He's still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr.Bwelle in his missions, it is a field learning opportunity they don't have at home.
"We were able to take part in operations to help sponge blood or pass the instruments to Dr.Bwelle," said Miss O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in the second year.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr.Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gave his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people was not nearing extinction.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this work," said Mr. Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons why I do this.

The two Frances of Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheatres and classrooms?
No doubt, but highlighting its weakness for the traverse paths, Sciences-Po, the Hautes Etudes.
Refers to the works of others in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the publisher.
Heir to the armchair that Fontenelle occupied at the Académie française?
Of course, but knowing that such a sacre cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which happened.
They readily recognized him as a great awakener, animator and federator of their work, but pointed out that he showed little willingness to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked tongues could see it as a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, endowed with a keen glance and brilliance, but incurably dilettante.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the one who passed not to write had much and well written.
The book here should definitely do him justice.
Yet, once again, there is the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagabondage, the jubilation set to jump as if on foot together from one subject to another.
But one quickly understands that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the dealer back to one and the same passion: to discover the constitutive knot of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: this is a period concern.
Here are a few, we were collectively invited to give a definition of it.
But in the peremptory spirit of our then leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliging, was entrusted to the prefects and subprefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora is after is quite different.
He does not pose as heir of an eternal francity, he refuses to define himself.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders in a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the shape of a rebus, tormented by irritating questions.
Of which this one, which originates from the company itself: why, in a country so long-term installed within its borders, so old-fashioned and solidly masonry, are we hearing these dramatic calls to unity?
They are only so pressing, Pierre Nora suggests, to conjure up the disorder born of the discords of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one that splits national history in half.
As of the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchic and the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without succeeding in denying it; on the contrary, anxious to regain its sacrality and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility as it had cut off the head from the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation of it.
And, from there, an invinciblely binary nation, shared between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps out of the Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora's American escapade might well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a bill of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But the American cousinship only makes it better to emphasize what is unique to us.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, congested men of an ancient indigenous regime, and all the more radical.
There is a consensual revolution when here it sow drama and confit.
Here are the founding fathers always honored, and here are revolutionary ancestors who are struggling to make models, and who have in fact killed each other.
There is institutional consistency, and here a cascade of constitutions, as many mistakes to be made up and attempts to be made again.
France is leaving, France is coming
Yet there was a time when the French thought they could stitch the torn dress of their history, and overcome the curse of the number two.
At this third republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed great interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything that in ancient France obscurely prepared modern France and proposing them a unified version of their history.
But that pacified identity only had a time.
Here she is again in debate, shaken by a new kind of immigration, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed into the European area.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France that is leaving and the circumspect sketch of France that comes.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
We discover that the chemineau was a casanier.
The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The edge walker stood in the centre of the centre.
And he who had tabled, more than half a century ago, a subject on the idea of a nation, but had evaded the initial exercise of the thesis, entrusts us, cum grano salis, that he will eventually have done it.
Certainly in a less stiff, more fragmented and more subtle form.
But let us not be mistaken, just as binding.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis speaks of the inner necessity of a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Removed in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his team of "Antenne 2" coming to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the hostage defence association "Otages du monde", which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the possibility for hostages to lodge complaints and bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
In detention for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, little by little, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" asked 62-year-old Jean-Louis Normandin, former major reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages du monde".
As early as the night you were released, you were on the 8 p.m. set of "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
On the spot, in Beirut.
When I'm released, I end up in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's dark - Roger Auque.
He says "we're free," but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but we're very tense too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They're dropping us off on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the site of the Summerland Hotel where the press is present.
Frenchmen take us to the French embassy.
It's time for the first calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a t-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night talking to Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arrived there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How was your arrival on French soil?
We're landing in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a bit brutal.
There's an incredible rush.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three television channels.
I'll be right back and there's plenty of them.
The descent of the stairs of the plane, the reunion with my son and my relatives, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers pull themselves up to take pictures and follow me to my home where I have to do a little police to prevent some of them from going up.
The media pressure is huge.
It doesn't stop, we're in a good position to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and we're suddenly in the media spotlight.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to handle.
But we did the hardest.
The same night, I'm at 8:00, the next day, too, I'm on TV.
Then begins some sort of life rehabilitation, very slowly, for one or two months that are a bit like a vacation.
How were the medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing?
I was entitled to a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Thanks to the following days of my return: radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not left to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostage takers.
It made sense.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I'm listening to what I'm saying.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things piss me off, others less.
I try to share things between questions about my past as a hostage and my hat as president of the association "Otages of the World" which allows me to distance myself, and I seem much more interesting to address.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, along with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there's a problem with semantics.
Hostages must be described as "political" hostage-taking - which is the case most of the time - and hostages must be given access to justice, to lodge complaints and to bring their hostage-takers to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for that.
Why don't we say to the hostage-takers "you've flouted the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva Conventions, we're going to bring you to justice"?
It seems to me, however, well founded, legitimate, with common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened to, and it shockes me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger is rumbling among the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of deposed President Mohamed Morsi began, they went down the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the re-establishment of the country's first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial that emphasizes this militant of the Muslim Brotherhood.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a prank.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial, a pro-Morsi, he's supposed to have Sisi tried, not the other way around.
Morsi must try Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed outside the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel criticises 9 US states for violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state recognized homosexual marriage, "all military spouses have the right to an identity card from the Department of Defense and the benefits that come with it," the minister recalled in New York in an address to the Anti-Defamation League to fight anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities" located in their territory, he denounced, accusing those states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided at these bases, or access their shops.
The Secretary of Defence stated that he had ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The sling of the nine states began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on the establishment of the Texas National Guard, due to a conflict between the Texas law and the federal law on homosexual marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of homosexual marriage at around 5,600 working people, including 17,000 people, including the National Guard, the reserve and pensioners.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2nd at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registration takes place on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualification phases will start at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled for 3 p.m. and the award ceremony at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, like the young hyerois prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years of age, he has already won his place this year for the European championships in Copenhagen and he likes nothing so much that he shows up to competitors who surpass him by three heads.
Toronto mayor hunts journalists who come to question him on a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drug use, according to several media.
A video brought to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested party, Rob Ford, has always denied that he used crack, while acknowledging that he has a tendency to use cannabis.
This Thursday, he drove several journalists from his property to question him.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in Val-d'Oise, obviously of foreign origin, while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies has been confirmed by the Institut Pasteur.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and take care of people who could have come into contact with this kitten between 8 October and 28 October," says the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"In man, the preventive treatment of human rabies, given after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the press release says.
The ministries now call on people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucosa or skin harmed by this kitten or whose animal would have been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact on 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"France being free of rabies since 2001, this kitten or mother have been imported from another country, not free", according to the press release.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "aboriginal" case of rabies recorded dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France was officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rabies on an illegally imported bitch from Gambia had been recorded in 2008.
"Rage is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time," said the ministries and is transmissible for nearly 15 days before the onset of the first symptoms of the disease.
Obama reverses his reform of the health care system
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that "if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their claimants, Republicans criticized the president in the past few days by accusing him of cheating on the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "an effervescence in the news" about the terminations, President Obama prompted the Americans who received these notices to seek new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better-adapted health plans for the same price, even less expensive than expected.
"You'll get away with it," he said.
The Administration has announced that it is not surprising that the 5% of the population who are self-insured are forced to change their plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me speak directly to these Americans: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius in her testimony before the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the October launch of the online market had failed "unfortunately".
"I'm as frustrated and irritated as anyone," she added.
I can't wait to regain your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, while she believed her microphone cut, speaking to an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday's Assembly session following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, Missouri Republican Representative, to determine whether she should adhere to the Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long kept insistently asking Ms.Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to subscribe to a plan via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel and a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky one, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colours of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the level of the track.
Germany's Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula One world champion, took part in the free practice of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday in a special helmet designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen among 1,500 drawings sent from all over the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, an automobile brand, of his stable.
He was invited to follow Abu Dhabi's GP, with a friend, and can thus see the German champion closely, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to be wearing this helmet on Friday and Saturday at the test.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Suburban Party
Let's not be mistaken.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Suburbarian Party" is not only aimed at the suburbs.
I have chosen a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of the suburbs, I speak to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
However, his project, presented on Thursday in a press conference in his native commune of Aubervilliers, was born of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes above all the neighborhoods.
My proposal #1 is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attaché, claims today to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are linked to the left, but if the right-wingers are ready to support me, I will also listen to them, he continues.
Only extremist parties I don't talk about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his programme - accessible on the Internet - based on many themes that are supposed to speak to the inhabitants of the suburbs and in particular to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at the age of 16, the rehabilitation of the function of building keeper...
It remains to be found candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, this risks being fair," he admits.
It's a matter of time and money.
The Suburban Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune has already seven lists in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails I've received since yesterday don't all come from the suburbs," he rejoices.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that American espionage "had gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry indicated a softening of the United States' defensive attitude to its surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions spying "had gone too far inappropriately."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he had, like Barack Obama, ruled on "autopilot" when a series of incendiary revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities came into being.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have learned of certain things in autopilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War to the difficult years of the Cold War, and then of course on 11 September."
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed boundaries, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far inappropriately."
And the Speaker is determined to try to clarify and clarify to people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels mistaken.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused as part of this process.
Mr. Kerry stressed, however, that NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added, "We live in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have indeed prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. spying case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counter-terrorism efforts with the U.S.," said the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut indicated that he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had made regarding a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the sense of frustration with the surveillance of the National Security Agency.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain at our side in the mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and chairman of the U.S. Senate Sub-Committee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with some of the US allies, but the agency's director said this week that it was inaccurate and that this was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the US.
Other revelations referred to documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of State.
The Director of Intelligence Services, James Clapper, justified the spying of the allies by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumult atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a Congressional trip, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show "affective firmness."
He explained that European heads of state should be honest with their citizens about the kind of spying programmes they have been implementing for years.
"We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world who do spying," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry has planned to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the rancour generated by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as United States surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, stunned by Shell's poor performance and in the aftermath of a Fed announcement that it would continue to support the economy as planned.
Australian woman appeals her sentence of imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Province Court on June 15 of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance recordings later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to inventing the story of all parts.
She was detained in a cell at the local police station before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who appealed to Canberra's Foreign Department to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
"We have obviously had a distressing moment, but we hope to take her home safely as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after bailing 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources reported that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer from Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increased sentence of up to two years' imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to restore her deteriorated image to tourists, which could lead to acquittal.
The French police will arrest Anderlecht's supporters who came other than with the RSCA buses.
The French police decided to set strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club d'Anderlecht against the Paris Saint-Germain scheduled for Tuesday, Marie Verbeke, the spokesperson for the Brussels-midi police zone, said on Friday.
Belgian fans of the RSCA who wish to go to this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stadium," the spokesman said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters intend to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has indicated that measures have been taken to make it possible to make arrests or even police custody," said Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
One year ago, this prompted a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff to consider how to better integrate students who live on horseback between different cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Living Together in French".
Vision diversité has been walking around schools for the past year to help students of all backgrounds discover common landmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighbourhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Big names of writers, artists, whether they're ethnic or they've come from somewhere else.
Who are our builders?
"So, we create projects so that they identify with all of this," explains Vision diversity president Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne of the New World Institute identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the sense of belonging, the support of the staff in the transformations we are experiencing, within the student clientele," he lists.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board has created a research centre that will give tools to teachers who also sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz of the University of Montreal will be its Scientific Director.
Preparing to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"Different teaching strategies, that's the real need," she sums up.
Research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistic, academic, social and cultural.
