Inflation in Europe has fallen on food
Accelerated inflation, as measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the price increase in the 13 euro area countries was higher than forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, the European Community statistical office in Luxembourg said.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the key interest rate by saying that lower interest rates, with higher commodity prices and lower unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two per cent.
According to one analyst, this is Catch 22 for the ECB: "We must deter" inflation so that we no longer have to intervene on this subject at a later date.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record in the last twelve years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area took off due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Grain futures market prices have increased by 88 percent and soya prices have also reached their highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price rose by 52 percent and last month a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 per cent, however, over the next 3-4 months, the annual average rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce the key rate twice in 2008.
Gallup reports government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly at the beginning of December. Thus since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Survey Institute) has never seen such low socialist support, namely 13 percent.
For the faithful voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, a support of more than two thirds (71 per cent) against the support of a fifth (20 per cent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Hungarian Democratic Forum) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the parliamentary threshold: their support is two per cent for the entire population.
Of the loyal voters some went to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate compared to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly severe has never been higher, it is 41 per cent and, according to 46 per cent, the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of last spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population anticipates aggravation and only one-tenth anticipates an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 per cent of those surveyed, a majority never seen in Gallup's previous polls, found that the Prime Minister was doing his job rather bad than good.
13 percent of respondents trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány, while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 per cent do not trust the Prime Minister at all and 27 per cent trust the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that discontent with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While after the riots of last October, 35 per cent of those polled wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, at present this rate represents only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
When asked about the intention to vote, 60 per cent of the respondents replied that they would certainly go to vote and the additional 20 per cent said that they would probably go to vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election next Sunday", only 55 per cent of the respondents would certainly participate and 15 per cent more would probably participate. According to the current intentions, the result of the referendum would be no doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to higher education fees, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees, and 84 per cent would say no to hospital expenses.
When we look only at the same proportions of those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent respectively would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital expenses.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs commercial triangle have maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent last year, the difference being that this year the rate of VAT has not increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas Basket also increased by 16 per cent on average, a value increase well over a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, "which had already flown away" in department food stores last December, have no longer risen sharply compared to the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The Daily Basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded by 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but the prices of turkey fillet, nuts and poppy rose sharply.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread of one kilo to 139 forints only was found.
Competition has not lowered the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the recorded bottle of two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it only cost 257 forints the recorded bottle.
However, this year, in terms of Daily Basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
Based on our calculations, Cora increased the price of its Daily Basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased it by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing last year's most expensive basket with this year's cheapest basket, we see a gap of 12 per cent, while the difference between last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive basket is 21 per cent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices rose by an average of 1,206 forints, although the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noticed in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has made trade perplexed, hypermarkets could not visibly determine which margin to apply to products because they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he may lose a big profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Because of the change in the VAT rate, the increase in the prices of the Daily Basket has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than the value of the 2006 basket, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the value of the most expensive basket was 1,630 forints higher than last year and the lowest price increased by 1,284 forints as well.
By bringing the two Christmas seasons closer together, we have seen a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer items have increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: for some essential diets, the Institute of Statistics has seen a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and eggs.)
According to the Daily Basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the evidence, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to get acceptance of the sharp rise in prices also by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-stored food per pallet.
On Wednesday morning important tails formed at the crates of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is lower in the provinces, many multinationals complain to the survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, caused mainly by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been registered in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the Chief Medical Officer of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also save money on disinfectants
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the trauma department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected on a man hospitalized following a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured in a serious car accident came out of the hospital but soon after he had to go back because of an MRSA infection and, since then, the doctors have not been able to perform a major operation because of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-drug-resistant pathogen were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, Chief Medical Officer of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
To know that it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e., staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
One third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by AS (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily cured.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a bacteria that is well resistant to antibiotics and will rapidly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
If the immune system is temporarily or prolonged, this bacteria can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, on elderly patients, with small weights or with a weakened body.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
We must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only there or we do not look for them, Tibor Nyulasi said.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the healthcare staff wear rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they have MRSA, however infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample sampling is not in mode
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not favourable to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and seniors' homes, hospitals should monitor inpatients and immediately isolate patients with AHR.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these examinations.
Most cases occur only if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief physician of the epidemiologic centre.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian directives for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even more rare in outpatient and basic care, Karolina Böröcz said.
Many hospitals save money on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA proliferates from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks, but there are also significant gaps in hospitals in this area.
MRSA proliferates by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while in terms of epidemic, the patients should be at least 1.5 metres away from each other.
Unfortunately, we also see that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, are saving on disinfectants, they lack nurses, the sick are numerous, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals where preventive measures are followed, the number of infections is lower in a demonstrable way or the spread of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenses for social security funds, which is why this infection is being combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of AHRM.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections are showing a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has identified as one of its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The commissioner, who was responsible for a fatal accident, was not intoxicated.
The official finding concerning the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement was drawn up.
It may be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has resigned from his post since then, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have led to a state of intoxication or stunned, communicated Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation, which previously found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before driving.
Last Tuesday, the former chief of the 22nd district police station crushed a 55-year-old man who was facing him when he shot, with his personal car, in Kossuth Lajos Street in the 22nd district. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian crossing.
(In fact, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not a mitigating circumstance, according to the Highway Code, a car that starts a turn must let pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being taken to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and asked for his retirement because, according to police communication, this accident upset him a lot.
The investigation into this case is carried out by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Budapest.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
Additional EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Hungary's Finance Minister János Veres and Vice-President Marta Gajecka of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three agreements in Budapest on Friday with a total value of EUR 400 million for a credit line to support education, transport and environment infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, of which a credit contract worth EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties. This time, the contract signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The agreement on the appropriation of EUR 150 million also covers the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, while the remaining EUR 150 million will be available for future use following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a €50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope first in the framework of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the metro line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would discuss the possible amendment of the original contract once Hungary has finalized the details of metro financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of EUR 8.4 billion for 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans at the EURIBOR interest rate, with a grace period of 8 years and no commitment fee.
Bulgaria, a paradise in the EU real estate market
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this Balkan country little mentioned in the past.
What, or who is bought in this EU market that is always the cheapest but will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the coast.
In the mountains, the most popular areas are Bansko, Borovec, Pambrovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nessebar but more and more of them are looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also more and more to buy in the cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, with commercial and office space promising the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter seasons, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy a building in Bulgaria are at the same time seeking to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the shores of the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who intend to move in buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old dilapidated houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, proximity to a large city, shops and, in general, that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of second homes (since last December Bulgaria has been listed as one of the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of realizing a capital gain in the medium to long term.
The price of the capital's buildings is constantly rising as a result of increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, over the last 5 years, they have increased by 21 per cent each year.
The increase in real estate prices is above and above the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of professionals end Tuesday, yet Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Road Map, which is supposed to define efforts to be made after the Kyoto Protocol's emission reduction period until 2012.
At the moment, there are intense discussions on this issue between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, it did not wish to discuss exact figures, although it was prepared to sign an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries commit themselves, excluding emission reductions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement has also been signed on aid to developing countries.
The Kyoto Protocol aid fund will be managed by a 16-member board of directors probably under the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), reported Piac es Profit (Market and Profit).
The six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister for Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to retain its role as a flagship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the "Post-2012 Agreement", and was prepared to reduce them by up to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also prepared to make commitments tailored to their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol countries had achieved a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members at that time made the commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent from the 1985-1987 level, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The challenge is high in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the Kyoto Protocol values would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need for which was stressed in the new report of IPCC, the international scientific body, which won the UN Nobel Peace Prize for climate change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the Earth's average temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided, which scientists believe would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army Recruits on YouTube
British Army units report on the video-sharing site recordings made during their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to make themselves popular.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has been passionate about YouTube: special units operating in Afghanistan are loading video footage of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken with miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are checked at the Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and then transferred to Londres where the compatriots load them on the Internet.
The political message is inescapable
Air force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences online through this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence signed up under the name "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and released videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Department (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were posted online to recruit and, according to the Ministry of Defence, were also used to inform the general public about the real objectives of the army's presence abroad.
Propaganda published in this way costs almost nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, communicated to the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, but it also inevitably carries a political message since it justifies in a special form the merits of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game
The army is bothered because, apart from the carefully censored and composed videos, amateur videos have gone to the sharing site which also present, for example, the deaths of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos had already been uploaded showing the areas of operation in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only recently been busy loading these videos.
The Americans do the recruitment a little differently by using the shooting game America's Army downloadable for free. In this game the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas raffle and donuts in ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a meeting at the end of the year with her employees who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by taking donuts and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a party with live music, another will enchant officials with a raffle and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, as well as the power.
The public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be hosted by the Ministry of Defence, but it will not be attended by employees of the Ministry.
At Christmas, Orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The ministry has a budget of 25 million forints to create the year-end atmosphere.
In comparison with other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will be celebrating.
GKM's party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the six hundred employees, three hundred and fifty are expected.
During this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be strict, there will be actors and also a raffle.
The Christmas of the NFÜ cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) with concerts and dinner.
The rental of the room cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party which is organised with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a company managing tenders.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté was rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt as we have not been able to reach the person in charge.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, organized a ball on the occasion of Saint Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
That ball was made up of 500 people.
The party began with the minister's welcome words and the dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: Evening dress was not compulsory at all at this ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Local Government are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, within its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not invite his employees officially to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected who will be invited to have a coffee and eat doughnuts, the press service said, the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his staff to have a drink in the Aula of the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large room at which 436 employees are expected.
He plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees have been celebrating Christmas in the same way every year.
No party atmosphere planned, the official character is reinforced not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at the castle of Vajdahunyad, located in the town wood, and according to the communication of the ministry, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the 100 guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, begin with a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, communicated to [origo] the respective press services.
The press department of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than 400 people were invited to the party at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike gather
The League's trade unions and the National Association of Workers' Councils will set up their strike commission on Friday, which will be responsible for coordinating Monday's indefinite strike.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the Health Fund Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant traffic congestion as rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the League Unions will make known the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The strike commission of LIGA - MOSZ will also be constituted, it will serve as coordinator of the actions of Monday.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and, from Monday, the organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the Health Fund Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Fund Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strikes.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide what to do next.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Fund Act will take place only late in the evening or even at night.
As a result of the strike scheduled for Monday, major traffic jams are planned: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volán companies risk being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the track will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for strikes, and the list of these is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report an indefinite strike, while others have reported a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) failed to reach an agreement on minimum services, yet, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the start of the service until 1 p.m., Budapest airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike for four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Union of Teachers have called to strike for two hours and from 2 a.m. to 8 a.m. respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike all over the country on an alternating basis, the Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will make a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League requires the government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and to submit a new concept to social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating retirement to be introduced from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim is for a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, that would make it possible to move into the system the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), attached to the Unions of the League, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased country risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, set up last August with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary), is increasing, in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", the company notes that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes can occur as a result of the worsening ethnic tension already existing between the Gypsy and non-Gypsies population of Hungary".
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy, which is likely to cause this situation, is the main reason.
As they say, this is due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "the public actors passed the public debate on the Roma affair to the representatives of radical and extreme political groupings which based a political strategy on the dispute between the Gypsies and the Hungarians".
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely to occur, they say.
However, according to the research institute, due to the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, particularly regarding the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following a greater publicity given to the reorganization of radical and extreme right Hungarian groups since autumn 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 calling themselves the "national self-defence association".
"The common feature of these rallies is that they define themselves as a civil organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their members for defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, defence of order), armed if necessary, moreover, by referring to the incapacity of the police, the army, in other words the state," they added.
They pointed out that everything was going according to the method which, based on the resentment of the political society and of the parties, sought to disguise different political ambitions in a civilian way.
The emphasis on civility and association status therefore serves only to avoid the legal pitfalls of registering such associations in court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultra-nationalist political actors of some neighbouring countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous disturbances of Roma that broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) led to the establishment of the Bulgarian Guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the UNB decided to set up a guard by saying that the organization's objective is "national self-defence".
According to them, over the last 17 years, the Gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had given rise to lively debates among Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement of some Bulgarian Roma organisations regarding the establishment of their own guard as a means of resistance points to the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, we can read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of the telegraph agency, Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days, the number of which will decrease next year.
Holidays are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes between national and state holiday days and days of rest.
Days of rest are often linked to religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the New Year are also days of rest, all the more so that New Year's Eve can rest quietly.
Moreover, in a year, we have a total of eleven festivals marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, in commemoration of the revolution of 1848, as is October 23 which is also the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1st is Labour Day and on November 1st and 2nd, we remember our deceased family members and friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state holidays, national or even religious rarely falling on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases where there is only one working day before or after the feast marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price for extended weekends by working or going to school the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in a special regulation on the replacement days of the days preceding or following the holidays.
The Act covers all employers and their employees, civil servants and persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions running continuously and in service, because of their vocation, and also for days of rest.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from 24 December, life ends almost all over the country because according to experiences the majority of people do more overtime or take holidays that they have saved for these purposes so that they can spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized for the first time around the Labour Day to allow employees to stay at home four days in a row.
Saturday, April 25, will be a working day to have a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is scheduled for October 23rd: Saturday, October 18th will be a working day to replace Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year will be marked by holidays because from 24 December, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can bother colleagues terribly
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that almost annoy us more: these are things that "enhance" the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether you get used to these troubles or take up the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing department," a colleague tells you.
That you missed a date?
At best he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with an apology.
Before you have painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
You're borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
You happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking otherwise they're right to be mad at you for stealing their property.
Don't bring envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there's no more envelopes and you need them right now.
Are you chatting about the privacy of colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop spreading gossip.
Who did what, with who?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone your information (suppositions) about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don't abuse his trust!
Bury the shared information in you and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Do you declare yourself ill without just cause?
When you call the office and you declare yourself sick under the pretext of a tearing headache because you feel bad or feel you need rest that day, think of the fact that your work, your urgent business, your missions to the end must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to work or that something might happen that would force you to stay at home, don't forget to tell your boss and colleagues so they don't be surprised at your absence the next day.
Frederation, sneezing, phone
You're immersing yourself in your work, but the snitch of your colleagues takes you out of it brutally?
You've become, unwittingly, a witness to a telephone conversation that you would have better not to listen to?
Don't bother your colleagues with humming, singing, talking aloud (which you lead above their heads), footbeats, big words or discontents expressed aloud.
They can disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing the others of a mistake?
If your work is not done for the deadline, you forget to send a mail or an important message, do not accuse anyone for this oversight!
Don't put it on account of any chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you have made a mistake and if it has caused inconvenience to others, fix the mistake!
Ask how you can fix your fault, fix negligence!
Do you feel too home at the office?
Putting a jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Do not put on comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Don't be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your job requires it by putting on pretty and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're not interesting anymore.
We move slowly in the usual morning stopper.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with electronic effects associated with it.
I'm raising the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones from earlier on, then a female choir joins it like a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts Zagar's song Wings of Love.
Hungarian music life has not spoiled us for a long time with good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the cap becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground are gradually beginning to change the overall image and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in Yonderboi's group before he started his own way, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe."
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the soundtracks filmed (e.g.
The Ferenc Török season).
The training initially played in small clubs began to be known to a wider audience when the magazine wan2 quoted their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important records on the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yunderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend who would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his whole became undeniably "trendy" but no one asked them if they would wear this label.
The band reacted properly, released a new and better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, can open up new avenues for them, although the title wants to represent continuity with the years spent at Pécs.
It was a line of the former group of Pécs de Balázs Zságer.
We are there with the reference to flight but next to the air music now appears, following the spirit and trend of the time, the guitar stronger, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the premiere of the album at the Millennial Park.
On the album, we find a real song for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
So it's okay (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: did your music remain a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; non mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The so-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere too.
The reception attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is either more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
The, people go to concerts and not only the young people of ten or twenty years old but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am obviously glad to see that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
However we have never made music for the market.
For us music is not made to achieve an objective but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important at concerts or the mutual influence already works but it is only perceived in the elusive changes of the moment.
Now, I've noticed that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you won't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and has a career in the west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
Instead, we are team players who have confidence in each other's musical presence and let them deploy.
At first, it was of course inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because we are many to leave his band and take another path.
hvg.hu: On the list of Mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love takes first place.
Many people heard Zagar's name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We don't plan on making a tube so we can sell the record.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the final album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why was it the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the choir with six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth, which was later named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want that song like that or did the girls change it a little bit?
Zs.B.: This song already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing in this song.
The sequence of chords attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the same night the melody that the girls learned later.
I got it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert also it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of a short solo by Judy Jay), they don't have a role alone, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than music, so music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were behind the scene, too.
Is that what you wanted?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we have to forget our ego a little bit, forget who comes from where, who goes or just let those wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to feel that euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: Actually, none as to the process of musical creation, we had more difficult songs during the mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for long, and then, little by little, everything got set up like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I already "released" this record.
Right now, these are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The treacherous trader risks billions because of its inferiority complex
He's a covert fraudster.
Thus designates its former employee the French giant Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost almost five billion euros because of him.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be regarded as incapable.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized in time the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He is fragile," his superiors have suggested, who have reported him to the police.
However, if we stick to Kerviel's testimony reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions produced a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year.
The crisis surpasses the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that so-called "sub-prime" mortgages, granted to low-income clients or to those who had experienced repayment difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he bet.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel says, adding that he didn't, of course, keep anything for himself."
Throughout the interrogation, he admits to having distorted the reports in order not to be detected.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex stock exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who risks nothing has nothing
Was he afraid to be discovered?
I'd rather not.
"I thought the mere fact of getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where does his willingness to risk so much come from?
He only arrived at his post gradually.
He had started working at Societe Generale in 2000 just after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later, he was already an assistant trader and in 2005 he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90 thousand.
Yet he knew that he would never win as much as others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less considered than the others.
With regard to my university curriculum and my professional and personal background," Kerviel told investigators.
Shortly after he took office, he achieved his first great success.
Thanks to the Allianz shares, he won half a billion euros by putting down this title during the attacks in Londrès.
And the mechanism was triggered - it wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you alone.
"It was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors knew everything, or rather, they suspected it.
"As long as I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
Now, it is then that the blow of the beginning of the year occurs.
He loses a billion euros in a day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer an employee of the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who doesn't take a vacation is a trader who doesn't want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, who could, in the coming years, contribute 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech kroner) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly DKr 125 billion from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around SEK 100 billion under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will be responsible for an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of 90.8 billion kroons next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, must be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new and more efficient management methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds among the new members.
The Court upheld the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for the former president of the country Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (nearly NOK 1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will or will not be re-incarcerated, according to the AP agency, is not clear at the moment.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison officers, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or they will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemán regularly moved government money to foreign company accounts in Panama.
These were fictitious companies and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and his closest supporters.
Part of this money went into the funds that Alemán had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget has been adopted.
That's how it is.
The state budget has been adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without opposition support.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford its refusal.
Unlike the heated debate leading up to the vote on the declaration of no confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies has passed without any problem this law, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
That's some kind of paradox.
Like it or not, each chapter and article is the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, although hidden behind the power competition between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why more attention is given to it in the media.
The arguments of politicians are much more interesting to opinion than the sharp figures.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments suffered three ills which the current budget is not able to settle at the same time:
The first is the large proportion of the money spent on warrants imposed by law, not only by pensions, but also by social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the biggest hazard.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued stunned bonds, in disproportionate debt to their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from the money from taxes, taxes and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In previous years, they were able to repay these debts by selling in bulk the shares of the distribution systems, particularly those of the energy, obtained from the State through privatizations.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If only official and verifiable facts are used, it can be seen that:
Our economy has already been going through a period of growth for several years, just like the rest of the world, and ČSSD is selling out.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were putting the state into debt more and more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls mainly on previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes which, in recent years, have unfortunately been unnecessarily swollen.
Although some of the absurd populist spending, approved last year before the elections, has been eliminated, if a lag in the age limit for retirement, as well as a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and anyone in power, it will only administer.
By barely exaggerating, it can be said that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes ordinary costs to be pushed back by mandate costs.
The deficit of $70 billion projected for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not dissipated all the money they could.
If we really do not want the policies in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it can collect in tax and tax rights, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to settle the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion will be placed on the money markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are prepared to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will auction $40 billion and will also provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual states have decided to take concerted action to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote in his report to Bernard Baumohl clients of the consulting company Economic Outlook Group.
"The concerted action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 per cent to about 50 per cent," Baumohl adds in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still expecting further losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, it is because they have to really understand what can still follow," says ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems the situation is really bad," he adds.
Central banks fear that, while banks themselves will have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect economic growth worldwide.
Central banks made this choice after the Londres interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market, could not be lowered.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the US, Canadian and English central banks had repeatedly declined their interest rates in the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates," said Reuters agency Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the Central Banks approach will help to alleviate the crisis, since it does not address the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the US.
President Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is expected to be mainly detrimental to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke on the issue of global warming.
Criticism this time over the UN international conference on climate change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric accompanying it and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is just a rocket of words, ersatz solutions to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed, when presenting his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often only encounter the caricature of my opinions".
From now on, interested persons can read its positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless has, in his opinion, enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic who is able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following: climate is constantly changing, changes in climate are therefore normal, there is no shared opinion on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too great nor too serious, they therefore represent no danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence climate change are useless, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
All the more so since he had experience of a totalitarian regime, he considered it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he felt was a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he explained several times that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against fundamentalist environmentalism which does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this subject two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driving licences in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their old driver's licence whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities are able to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of unlicensed drivers will travel the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving licences, especially those who no longer wish to drive.
As municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, authorities in the capital are inundated with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has increased this week.
The Town Hall satisfies about 2000 customers a day.
There's a tail of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140 000 drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to apply for the grant within a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred kroons.
Drivers of vehicles who fail to complete the compulsory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and take the road without a valid licence will be liable to a fine in January.
The guilty party will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence through an amicable process.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2500 kroons.
According to old reports, even a person who was not going to travel was liable to a fine.
In doing so she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 kroons.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding KKK 1,000.
However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's licence is, in his opinion, a document that people can decide whether or not to have it.
It is not like the ID card that must be valid without exceptions.
Persons who no longer wish to drive should surrender their driver's licence.
Simply bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with records dating from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the sentences of detectives pacted with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Ko+a+k, former police officers accused of collusion with David Berdych's gang, will serve 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
The Prague High Court thus finally sentenced them by reducing their sentences by 1 and 2 years respectively.
Originally, the Department's detectives for the fight against organized crime faced prison sentences of 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is currently waiting for the first instance verdict.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials in excess of 16 years' imprisonment.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Court found guilty for involvement in 19 hold-ups, and the Superior Court was now dealing with the appeal interjections of 16 of them.
Since the beginning of the investigation, most of the accused had questioned the prosecution by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemia Court of Justice, police officers, following an agreement with Berdych and others, passed on information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang gave 30 percent of the larceny back to Opava and Ko+a+k.
The prosecution refers to the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robberies, the victims of which, in most cases, have suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of authority by a public official and prohibited armament.
During the house searches, the police discovered pistols illegally detained, shells with a steel core, a viewfinder for direct laser fire or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of further robbery by hand Berdych and a whole series of other persons.
Other men from Berdych's neighbourhood are still explaining themselves to the court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing has avoided, for the moment, Tom+Půta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of substitution for children: 12 million
The lawyer of the affected families Igor Veleba wants to obtain compensation from the hospital of Třeb+ for 12 million crowns plus the costs.
Three million for each mother, two million for fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer at the Ondřej Dostál hospital absolutely disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a claim, which is very high," Dostál said at the end of the hearing.
"In order to be able to form an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the expert report which the opposing party commissioned to draft.
We will check whether this one has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál said.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablořov's family asked for a million crowns for each month that she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better borne by men, although they were faced with remorse for not having been able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, remain less serene in the face of the current trauma and in the face of what is happening at the moment, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the hospital in Třeb+ on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablořov.
The governor of the Vysočina region Miloš Vystrčil handed over, at the end of October, to each of the families 100,000 kroons for the reimbursement of expenses occasioned by the error of the hospital in Třeb+ managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally obliged to provide insurance in civil liability.
In the event of non-compliance, they must draw on the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may request assistance from the manager.
Until now the courts had recognized relatively low compensation, the sums calculated from the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the trade mark Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, it was he who had used the title King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tom+Harabiš, former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr.Harabiš and his team are interfering with Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Valašsko's Kingdom evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comedian.
Harabiš agreed.
"There is a job behind us of almost ten years.
Looking for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project is successful and that they could benefit from it.
It is they who want to parasite on our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the title valašský král (King of Valašsko) for the first time in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, it had no bearing on the plan to set up a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of issuing passports from the Valašské Království.
From a humorous action originally a business and a lucrative commercial activity emerged, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka agreed that his name and signature should be mentioned in the passport and even offered the holders sales on the price of the visit to his farm and his theatre performances.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the nude idea, published by Polívka in the manež show, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské království project," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and his team, which devoted itself to the project intensely.
Collaboration between today's enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating with the deposition "of King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by singer Jarmila Šuláková as Mother Queen.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, a request that the court rejected today.
What might make the case clear is the envisaged tournament for the throne and half the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to go fast.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr Polívka can of course register," added Harabiš.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: elimination of prejudices
Actually, I've never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the change in speed, of the driving and also of the manufacturing could, in many respects, be described as below average.
At the moment, however, there is on the market his successor the Peugeot 207, which is much better.
All the more so since the combi named SW goes one step further, I just have to think better.
When I was testing the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, for example, I complained about the head space on the back seats.
While there ended the complaints because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will be, in this respect, at ease.
Let's get a quick look.
I'm going to talk about the inside very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
It's a pretty successful design, my only comment about the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a more inventive design, since the car looks so elegant.
Seats are comfortable and the time when one could complain about seats or too short backs is over.
Lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in the dimensions of the bodyshell is also noticeable here.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the head already mentioned disappear.
A safe in the safe
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate it as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear swivel ice) and a rather easy stowage.
Blind spaces are equipped with stopping elastics which are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold heavy enough objects.
But let's stop by the volume.
The latter makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is in comparison with the competition a rather average figure.
Apart from the best-selling Škoda Fabia Combi in Czech Republic.
Comparing the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav's product, the Peugeot remains very much behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on holidays abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I were to bring out the advantages, I would mention the undercarriage remaining after the backrests of the rear seats were overturned perfectly straight, or a very low step.
120 horsepower on four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what a 1.6 should look like that's what makes a family hatchback work.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda, which often gives the impression of having a tailpipe clogged by a mop, then I can only be enthusiastic.
Let's go through the tariffs.
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, one must be aware that one has tested a car quite well equipped, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4-litre engine of 329 900 Kč is still fair.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 Kč.
In addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, automatic control of the rear windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs 531,900 Kč.
This is a lot, but try to add to the Fabia price the extra equipment and you will get a very similar figure.
So all that remains is to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils into British schools is not going well
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, raising concerns among the rest of the population about the development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is, for the time being, facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of native inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of Northern Kent, where conflicts between remaining and immigrants of Slovak origin are beginning to intensify, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, chicanes and fights between students have been transposed into relations between parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who hit a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The perpetrator defends herself by claiming that the boy insulted him with racist remarks.
The police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two teenage girls.
The girls had allegedly addressed racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we got home, a young man climbed up the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks," described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One resident went so far as to describe conflicts with immigrants as struggles for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between natives and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70,000 Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak pupils attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your leave can happen if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
The kitesurfing, the golf and the roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
By the time of the Spaniards, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus described it as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the repository and place of transshipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who had it built, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50' of the last century, were circulating on the broad boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
The stars of the show business and politicians of the whole of America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph yourself on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, we will mix you the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since the jigoulis and fiats that were once imported have long ago, in a climate so salty and wet, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is noticeably decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
Over the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated especially by fans of small trains.
The cane had been re-entered from the extended plantations in the sugar mills on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades, and this is how small locomotives can be seen running, the contemporary of which are not only in museums elsewhere.
Where to direct his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the best known places.
So there is no need to write a lot about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise remember that in the Hemingway property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Vi+ales valley to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation grows on calcareous soil.
Mogotes, calcareous balloons and rocks ascend in candlelight from the bottom of the valley, and, fertile soil having caught in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetal carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco of the highest quality is probably cultivated.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the cigar factories of Havana.
Perhaps someone will find it equally interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was shot.
Trinidad
An ancient town founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought him glory and wealth.
The richness was embodied in the beauty and the town-vitrine character of this small city.
Koloniální španělská architektura,výrazně ovlivněná pozděj
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountain massif Escambray, is so far away that still in the 1950s of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everyone just had a roof over their heads.
If you have more time than an afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth visiting interesting places in the surrounding area, such as Playa Ancón beach or the Sucrose Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música which comes alive after sunset and where the music does not fade until the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This view is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads that lead from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without any marks of human activity.
UNESCO has placed the eastern cove of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of world heritage.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in reality, it was born about a hundred years after the journey of Columbus) and from the hill where the old castle stands and the current hotel El Castillo, we see several mountains table, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Sows and the island of Isla de Pinos, the cabaret Tropicana, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this one could fill a quantity of pages.
Only, as they say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, say Americans
According to the United States, the lack of soldiers and necessary equipment has an impact on the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not proceeding as it should, agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing protest by the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States this week, through Defence Minister Robert Gates, has called NATO troops for greater activity, Britain's priority is the strengthening of the Afghan government's authority and the intensification of development aid.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety per cent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to US military data, the most intense of the last five years.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, to 60 per cent in Helmand Province, located in the south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of them in the southern part.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are requesting additional helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
"I'm not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of the three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Which is passive
In recent months, there have also been conflicts between countries involved in the issue if all allies are actually doing everything possible in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans in Afghanistan have a relatively large representation.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat demands they face are not as stringent as those in the south and east parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun called the German soldiers lazy this week.
"The Afghan lazy discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild counterattacked by publishing a photo of a British troupe during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
Each Czech State is responsible for a debt of more than 84,000 kroons.
The total debt rose at the end of September to NOK 842.7 billion.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
As a result of better-than-expected changes in government budget savings, the Department has reduced the planned amount to DKr 152.8 billion.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to NOK 842.7 billion.
During the nine months of this year it has therefore increased by 40.2 billion kroons.
From June onwards, however, it fell by 13.4 billion kroons.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on State debt dating back to early October.
Each Czech is responsible for a debt in excess of 84,000 kroons.
Throughout the last year, the State has incurred more than 111 billion crowns in debt.
"For now, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit forecast for next year, we could cross the border by only one trillion kroner in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for the iHned.cz server.
The forecast of Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor is similar: "We could exceed the billion in 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene was changing, that policies were prepared to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I am not waiting for this change," he said.
Debts grow
The debt of the State consists of the debts of the central government and is generated mainly by the accumulation of deficits in the State budget.
Government debt is financed by treasury bills, annuity securities, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The State's internal debt has increased this year from $38.5 billion to NOK 719.4 billion.
The State's external debt has increased this year from DKr 1.7 billion to DKr 123.3 billion.
The debt of the State called negotiable reached at the end of September 803.3 billion kroner and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average debt liability of the State amounted to 6.5 years.
"Total debt increased interannually from the first to the third half of the year by 13 per cent, which, given the current healthy economy, is far too high.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated by pension securities, where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be room to negotiate when pension reform comes," commented Pikora.
Better than we expected
This follows on from the government's strategy for financing and managing the government's 2007 debt, which the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
However, in early September, thanks to better-than-expected changes in the state budget savings, the Ministry reduced the planned amount to DKr 152.8 billion.
The sum consists mainly of the deficit in the State budget, which is clearly going to reach SEK 76 billion this year, instead of the SEK 91.3 billion originally planned.
Secondly, the maximum sources foreseen for the Czech consolidation agency are 13.3 billion kroons, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state pension securities for 43 billion kroons and repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to 1.8 billion kroons.
She was appearing today before a court in Khartoum for appointing a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and to deportation, said her lawyer.
The British woman was accused of having left pupils between the ages of 6 and 7 to give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam was illegal.
She was liable to a penalty of whipping.
This 54-year-old British teacher at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested Sunday at her home and charged with violating Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story goes back in fact to September, when this teacher asks her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
"Eight names come out of the mouths of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the bear's photo followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of representing the prophet as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he says it is only an "innocent mistake."
Opinion shared by many of the teacher's students who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never speaks of religion in the classroom".
Recall that the first name Mohamed is also the second name most given in Great Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, they did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final session of discussions on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the Statute," said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake”, his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to honour their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence in the immediate future, but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist".
End of mediation on 10 December
The ombudsmen of the troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Kharchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last session of negotiations since the troika was entrusted with a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Kharchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners believe that EU-supervised independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina expresses its readiness to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," announced the president of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future premier of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to a past that led to murders and deportations".
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic, for his part, considered that a compromise was always possible, warning the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the independence of the province.
In particular, Belgrade said it feared a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia," he said, "this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be taken exclusively by the Security Council, where its Russian ally has the right of veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"Only one solution in the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council.”
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking people would be "in consultation" with the Westerners.
Bush rips off an Israeli-Palestinian agreement
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference he convened on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately with a view to finding a definitive solution to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything possible to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must put an end to its settlement activities," Bush said, reminding both parties of their obligations under the "road map" for peace that they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including core issues".
This name covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven out of their homes in what is today the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and thorough" and address all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others."
Going up to the podium, Olmert pledged that the upcoming talks would be "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
Bush set at the end of 2008 the deadline for the implementation of his "vision of two states" Palestinian and Israeli co-existing.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment to this from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was a success for Washington, had initiated a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that offered Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it tackles the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", says Prince Saud in his interview with the Arab-speaking daily newspaper with Saudi capitals.
For the D.A., the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As every time in this type of fact various, official versions and rumors oppose.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was travelling Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m. on Louise-Michel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in intervention but on patrol, and was travelling at 40-50 km/h, without a gyrophare," says a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, “not approved, therefore not allowed to run on the public road” (see below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was running “very fast”.
"She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority to the right," says one police officer.
The blood alcohol check performed on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (before high, star windshield, bumper torn) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "facts of manslaughter and non-assistance to persons in danger" to the IGPN, cosaisie avec la direction départementale de la sécurité publique du Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor explained that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, excluded the responsibility of the police officers.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, heard on Sunday evening, confirmed “the police version, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left”.
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the friction of the footholds on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled while the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumour quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police officers had very quickly left the premises, thus not lending help to the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out "serious misconduct" with respect to this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, on which one must be very careful," one police source said.
Libération met with an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of its windows giving precisely to the scene.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them," said this witness.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw "a police officer completely hagard, who limped.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently with the certainty that those present had of the youth's unexpected situation, the police officers were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to this witness, the aid arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left".
They also performed cardiac massages, in vain.
"I will not let it be said that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor pointed out.
Tension rises in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police repressed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the city of Lahore, in the eastern part of the country, some 2,000 lawyers who were protesting against measures taken under the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement officials, according to witnesses.
They responded by throwing stones, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers charged and injured lawyers.
Several were reportedly arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court's bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other demonstrations reportedly took place in Multan (central) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement gathered the support of the religious parties grouped together in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president urged the population ''to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and trash to those who took an oath before Musharraf''.
''Musharraf's promise no longer holds'''
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly affected by the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday night.
In the coming days, it was expected to decide on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election to the presidential elections on 6 October by indirect vote.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
''Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court decisions'', the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president ''no longer holds'' after the establishment of the state of emergency, said Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to abandon his military uniform by 15 November, when his first presidential term ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied persistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf had been placed under house arrest by his deputy chief of the armed forces.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unanticipated
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36 per cent) is not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the IUD still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception has nevertheless led to a better “control of fertility”, according to the institute, which notes that the use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 years has increased from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated to the nearest month for one in five couples and if possible in the spring, the season considered the most enjoyable to have a child.
Spectacular repair on space station
It took more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his fellow crew of the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, essential to the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated the records because of its duration, its remoteness from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was conceived, the tools "doed" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical room that would soon house the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of dock for laboratory modules.
But we must be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew's second task, therefore, was to move a solar power generation module weighing 17.5 tonnes, already present on the ISS, to position it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the redeployment of the module's solar panels, which have a wingspan of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged on nearly a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment was stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally required to perform a control exit from the Shuttle Discovery and then to repair another solar panel with a defective rotation system, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to caracole at the end of the 30 meters of length of the remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalker in Nasa.
Large, resistant, very skillful, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At 46 years of age, this trained physician was charged with "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he severed the faulty cable and installed some kind of "clamps" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a hockey mini-cane wrapped in insulation to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing hundreds of volts, was designed and "bricoled" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was fully deployed before making an inventory of his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to the Shuttle Discovery for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
The EADS action is currently in sharp decline on the Paris stock exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its forecast of operational results for 2007 as a result of delays caused by the slow progress of the engine development of the A400M, which conditions the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to ''between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros including more than 1 billion for Airbus'', announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these expenses, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result targets (EBIT) for 2007 when its quarterly results are presented next Thursday, he adds without further details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new expenses is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS's operating result fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to burdens related to delays in another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group was planning a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday at the exit of the ballot box: the Russians will opt massively for President Putin's party, united Russia.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days before the general elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a televised message on public channels, which are already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He did so as the leader of the United Russia list, the pro-Kremlin party, whose victory was expected to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not leave any sign of this by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - its favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and want honest, transparent and open elections, free elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the point of view.
It denounces a campaign tainted with pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganov says that "there have never been such dirty elections, even at the time of Yeltsin."
After the repression of last weekend's protests, former chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, remains banned from visiting according to her lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of homo sovieticus"
Behind these unsuspended legislation are two much more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential elections, on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, both legislative and presidential, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada centre.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the St Petersburg State University goes back: civil society has fallen behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin has re-established the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population all the more since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease," says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility" which they had briefly demonstrated after the break-up of the USSR.
"What's the point of thinking?"
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business community.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for extremists either.
Conclusion of 54-year-old professor Tamara Cherednitchenko: “What is the point of thinking?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far only available for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and by name, at the request of a former victim or his successors.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including France, Germany, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
Since the ratification process by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow research to be carried out "in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, were opposed to the public opening of these nominative documents because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants drawn up by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the civilians deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, possibly, to provide proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," said Dr Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
EU and India want free trade agreement in 2008
At present, indo-European bilateral trade already amounts to nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The EU's foreign ministers gave the European Commission their green light last April to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its leading foreign investor, but India is only the EU's ninth largest trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will greatly boost both economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," argued Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants trade annually for "47 billion euros in goods" and "10 billion euros in services", said Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has "not yet reached its potential". The EU and India meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering £10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday that it was anxious to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of £10 billion at a base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she says in a press release.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This seems to be the first time that BoE has put liquidity on the market at five weeks in an open market operation.
These are normally done at one week.
The BoE adds in its press release that it " stands ready to take further steps to maintain the rates" of interbank loans on a day-to-day basis in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, a higher rate since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England had been accompanied by a large penalty rate which had deterred banks from using them.
According to rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the price of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine PS proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and New Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Listed in a socialist "nice" (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS's national office, including the 50% increase in the employment premium, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport cheque or the supervision of rents.
UMP and NC having voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was adjourned after the general discussion which gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between the majority and opposition a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of the MPs PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of his proposals in the form of amendments to the bill of amendment of the Finance Act considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following many rumours about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it's an honour to work with someone who has inspired the current movement of festivals in America," said Charlie Jones of C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is scheduled to be held from August 8 to 10 on a 500 acres private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been co-owner of the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury "the most inspiring event" he's ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We chose Philadelphia as a market and worked diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," says Jones.
"We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in politics because of the current administration, says Charlie Jones.
"Happily, we were able to talk with Melvin Benn and we are about to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after having stood out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
"The Melvin Benn European model is a rural festival, while ours are held in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a rural festival to European and urban American."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are interesting enough to allow investment in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very large", as is the capacity of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been issued to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of going to press.
"Vineland will be rock-flavored, but the music will be varied, in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award at the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood movie sets to Montreal when no other Terminator opposes it...
This mission of seduction is part of the duties of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the hands of the "Governator"?
"You have to be careful, it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she thinks the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she'll go.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best," he says.
The race to the festivals
For now, however, the priority of Denis Turcotte is the promotion of cinema from here.
The Oscar race has begun.
It will be at all festivals on the West Side, whether it's Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, about presenting Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that directors do interviews.
The Dark Age had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock exchange? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks from the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands hoping for the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year the experts are not as sure as this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December on the stock exchange generally has a positive attitude.
However, forecasts should not be made exclusively on the basis of statistics, since, given the current context, uncertainties are on the market, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock exchange gaining momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is nourished by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of collateralised alternatives, especially fixed income, affected by the flight effect towards quality values both in long periods and in short".
For this, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behaviour, not free of volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulating inflationary pressures"
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"It's not the best thing," says the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish stock market index, has lost almost 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Intermoney analyst Juan Solana believes that Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points due to portfolio reorganization and traditional pension contributions that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuance that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Feast of the Constitution (6 December).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Banco, assesses that we are near technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be provoked according to the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new maximum cots.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some builders "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While, Federico Olucha, d'Inversis Banco assures that the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they get involved.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do as well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the past seven years, only on two occasions in December has been a low-income month.
The authentic year-end rally took place in 2003, an exercise during which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of winnings (for the time being the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it manages to compute on his rally at the end of the year.
Banque Populaire will open 200 offices open 12 hours Monday to Saturday
The Banque Populaire has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in Spain's most commercial areas.
These branches, which will operate under the popular brand Max, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8.30 pm, and to open on Saturday from 10 am to 8.30 pm.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of Banque Populaire will be decisive for other organisations to join or not to join this initiative, which coincides with business hours.
This is precisely what the Banque Populaire is seeking.
Attract autonomous customers who travel in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and street shops chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies throughout Spain in about 18 months, since this is not the opening of new agencies but a renovation of existing ones.
To this end, the agency will modernize its existing branches in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on different streets.
In this way, the amplification of schedules is accompanied by a different design from the inside of the branch and a new, more contemporary design with brighter colours.
The bank's sales manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renovation does not involve major investments, but the hiring of staff, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets of Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and public holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for its sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers', Rivero notes.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
We did it.
With this sentence Paolo Vasile, a delegate of Telecinco, expressed yesterday his satisfaction, at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect tarnished his joy: 'What hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have decreased less,' he said.
However, he emphasized that in a weak market, 'we have dropped less'.
Telecinco finished yesterday with a 2.54% increase.
This gain stabilizes its loss at 15.66 per cent over the past year.
The market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento ( 13% more) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
His rival Antena 3, who gave in yesterday 1.52% and who accumulates a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
In the case of Sogecable, the value of the other comunication companies listed on the stock exchange amounts to 3,571 million; in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días), 2,518.53 million; and in the case of Vocento, 1,779 million.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience '.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television channel to surpass the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the managing advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
In order for this announced data to be real, the television channel is expected to record a 3.6% increase in advertising billing for the current fiscal year, compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, Antenne 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the fiscal year (up to $734.4 million), while television's net revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that annalists point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the important payout it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
' We have the official compromise of giving as little as 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given securities with the 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its benefit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in projected revenue growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company has decreased the forecast of the gains of Antenne 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and to 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress of amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the effort made by Members of Parliament and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of organizations to ensure that markets function effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Law, involves the modernization of the financial markets, at a time when it strengthens the protection of the investor, improves the powers of the executives of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the different executives of the European Union.
The new regulations will enable financial advisory services to be provided for specialized social reasons as well as to natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (FICs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio managers.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments, so that multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems can be added to regulated secondary markets, which compete with existing stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment services companies to disclose information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management in the market and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they carry out to facilitate control by CNMV.
Through the Congressional Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, one of which highlights that titularized debts will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has proved with what happened with the high-risk US mortgage debt (subprime).
Moreover, they took advantage of the transposition of the management took advantage of it to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economy may have 30 years after in 1977, was approved, the royal decree which delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to lend its services of marketing products and attracting new customers to different investment companies at the same time.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices increased by five-tenths in November, up to 4.1%.
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the rate of inflation in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on the price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by offering data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available for publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the leading indicator is indicative only, because it does not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be released on December 14.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice-president and the minister of the economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "time figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes stated in the Congressional corridors that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with regard to monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economy said in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock EUR 42,000 million over three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen to over 50% up to £12,000 million (16,800 million euros) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emerging credit from the Bank of England.
At that time he collected some record deposits above 25,000 million pounds, a figure that gradually dropped in two and a half months because of the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government has offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the organization with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues of British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get that remaining £18,000 million until reaching the goal of 30,000 million.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for its loud advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year in advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Association's offer, in which three other companies participate, including its favorite to save it from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcia commune of Totana (of the People's Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption scheme discovered this week.
Ade plus, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced the me of last May Juan Morales, current right-wing deputy, and until then municipal councillor of the town hall, and which according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the chain SER, could be the 'leader' of this frame.
Officers continue to search municipal and urban council premises and the possibility of further stops is not ruled out in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption scheme, discovered earlier this week, was charged.
As reported yesterday by the SER Channel to the lawyer of the deputy 'People's Party' Juan Morales, he was arrested when he left Morales's home with important documentation in his possession concerning the frame.
Moreover, according to the sources of the survey, the purpose of the survey is the alleged receipt of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight detainees.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the elections
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
Thus the organizing secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this noon at the federal seat of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the former Minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
Moreover, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the Manche politician will be the candidate of the Socialist Group which will preside over the Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, which on 15 November last made public his decision not to stand for the next general election and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the academic setting.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
Moreover, he pointed out that, although citizens already know who the vice-president of the economy will be if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to transform the House into a "house of respect and not insult or shout" and to make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems lamentably that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know-how" and he did not want to act as if he was already in his position so as not to fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might consider "a domination".
Climate propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change is subject to unmerciful persecution by both the sceptics of its predictions and those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate ironic coherence.
This is all the more so for a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has made a decisive contribution to Spain's leadership of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who is responsible for non-execution, in what sectors has it occurred and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
Moreover, it must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be required of us, what economic consequences this will have.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has been and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing oneself and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costy, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of businesses and individuals.
Up to one hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him to be so dangerous in Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With phrases that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for electoral campaigns that does not speak, does not denounce and does not demand, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is only a purely virtual contracting party and does not claim that we are travelling by bicycle or cooling up with the range.
Mayor and local police chief of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcia town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the Town Hall and a hotel entrepreneur suspected of possible urban crimes, today informed the sources of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the town hall, where at the moment numerous agents have gathered, who have also presented themselves to the function of municipal councillor of Urbanism and to the municipal company of management of Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 housing units, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, that Tribunal number 1 of Totana investigated.
The first six detainees have now come to a judicial disposition.
According to the sources, the former municipal councillor of Totana and currently an autonomous member of the PP party, Juan Morales, is the subject of the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as was the current fiancée of the former municipal councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and the entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, Nuaria Group agency, and through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Gendarmerie's Central Operating Unit (UCO), whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies linked to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
So only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry business in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcia commune of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were requalified and its plan would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico square; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

A colleague passed the information on the introduction in the Penal Code of offences on Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros is considered only as a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Stealing in a store for a value of up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than the one imposed for downloading (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would involve a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. Distribution of films protected by copyright and without the authors ' permission is more punishable than distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).

My attending doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
That is, the feelings generated by workers' monthly pay depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted using tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the neurocognition imaging group of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed".
The researchers observed that when both individuals guessed that they were receiving the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte for eight years has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals from the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will go away with bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former leader serbobosnio Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in this list whose documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'Carla's list' (2006, not projected exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor in Belgrade in New York who pursues fugitive criminals and puts pressure on the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What assurance does it suit me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible claims, involves a significant expense which will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, length of driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
It is that, escoger el seguro de automóvil adecuado es incluso más dificil que elegir el modelo de vehículo.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is evidenced by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium awarded and in return becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a loss.
The premium is the price of insurance, which takes into account various factors, such as age, gender, length of driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the higher the likelihood of an accident, the higher the rating to be paid.
This is why people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower rate of claims due to their prudence.
Similarly, by using censuses, the companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency and thus the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
This is why the driver has to study the situation carefully to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
The most significant variables are presented here when choosing one or other type of insurance, so that the insurance company, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face a variety of disadvantages when entering into an insurance contract at an affordable price, such as low driving experience and seniority of a driver's licence.
Although the ideal way to be well insured is insurance at all risks, there are other, more cost-effective options.
The most forward-thinking drivers can opt for any-risk, deductible insurance, so that they get coverage from any-risk insurance but at a more accessible price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be determined by the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount will be," says Luis Noguera, the Spanish manager of First Europa, an online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under 25 years of age try to be careful and avoid claims as far as possible, since this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the company's basic rate.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
"The subsidies and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses ", clarified Noguera.
After 25 years it becomes easier for drivers when they enter into an insurance contract, since the loss rate is reduced thanks to accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is preferable to choose a risk-free insurance policy.
"Normally young people cannot take advantage of the experience acquired in advance after an accident", says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable for the client to negotiate insurance at any risk, as long as his or her economic situation permits.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be those with the lowest claim rate, because the increases will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be any risk insurance with deductible (up to 300 euros), or a third-party insurance extended from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have more casual driving and they have more purchasing power to afford the luxury to assume a larger amount of franchises," says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, a risk-free insurance policy is preferable (i.e. 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance policy when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that motor insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents a major expense, which is why it is essential to study properly the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to finish in the eighth of the finals
The Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are taking action next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point that they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to classify themselves.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to make sure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass him.
These two Group D games will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as AC Milan is due to play the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the final of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most awaited result, although both teams will try to get out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would stay first and ensure a better cross in the eighths of the final.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to rank if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but she won't be able to comp only on this since with nine points the game is back to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who are hopeful to rank for the eighth in the final for the second time in the Champions League, after having been beaten in the last edition by a Kaka goal during the overtime (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to the Shakhtar, in case the Celtic loses, to rank for the eighths of the finals to be able to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that the Benfica, although it is last and without possibilities to continue the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls initiated their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, since the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice ' (Victoria Beckham), ' Scary Spice ' (Melanie Brown), ' Baby Spice ' (Emma Bunton), ' Sporty Spice ' (Melanie Chisholm) and ' Ginger Spice ' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the group meeting is "glossy".
Around 20,000 people have exhausted the tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which is told the story of the band that was fury at the end of 1990.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes their main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls went on stage showing the bracelets that 'Posh Spice'''s husband gave them, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days before.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice' who joined the band in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and who caused the group to dissolve two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feelings have changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," said Chisholm on the group meeting that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, "things have worked out and we appreciate each other very much".
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last showed up in 1998.
First, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of babysitters was waiting for them.
She has five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will exhibit in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
In Madrid they will show off on 23 December.
The new gas affair between Russia and Ukraine throws the alarm.
A dispute over the price of fermented gas between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of repercussions on oil exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are transported by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel oil, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to the EU countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow arises after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, the Russian gas-producing monopoly company, tried unsuccessfully to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase as planned, its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would involve Ukraine, a 40% increase in import costs from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas passes," Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinkh told the Reuters news agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006 the interruption of Gazprom supplies destined for Ukraine.
This led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, thus increasing prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve the checks to be carried out on its extra-community employees to check whether they have criminal precedents, the Monitoring Committee said.
Reviser General Robert Black's warning came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Mr Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health has no precise data on the number of overseas workers he employs.
His report nevertheless highlighted other decisive checks, correctly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General conducted checks on extra-Community personnel following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, an Iraqi-born doctor in the service of the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after driving with his jeep, in the doors of the main terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October as suspected of being involved in various attempts to explode cars in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out checks on criminal precedents, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office of Control of Criminal Precedents, thus allowing employers to undertake controls over various countries.
"Although we have discovered that some personnel information has been verified, this is not done every time," the report says.
Mr Black stated that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks he would do himself, but he also added: "Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland said that it is "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment checks can identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring any added value."
Scottish health authorities reported employing 1,161 overseas workers, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the reviewer-general has pointed out that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, partly because of problems with the identification of staff members with indeterminate contracts, who might or might not choose to stay in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current health authorities' procedures in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its policy and system of pre-employment checks for overseas health service staff.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, together with the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, valid for all employees, including overseas workers.

The fifty-year-old director, having shot films such as Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel of Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of Cristal Skull.
Winston said he was proud to receive this award named in honour of star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney allowed people like me access to the cinema," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."
"I was admired in front of this great actor today, I was extremely honoured"
The Oscars of the independent film, better known as "the Bifas" are awarded by a jury composed of directors, actors and festival organizers.

Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 activists involved in organizing cells manipulating an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clergymen and armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against the allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, planned an attack on an oil site in Orientale Province, said TV newspaper.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 military personnel to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper quoted a statement by the Minister of the Interior, stating that 18 of the persons arrested belong to a cell headed by a "missile launch expert" who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
Twenty-two of the detainees appear to have plotted the murder of clergymen and armed forces.
The government has asked the clergy to do more against Saudis led in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting against the Allied Forces and against the Muslim Shiite government allied to the United States, considered heretic according to the Saudi Sunny hard line.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clergymen have worked with the authorities to support the royal family policy that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five months," said the Minister of the Interior's spokesman on state television.
Among the detainees there are 16 members of the Medina organized into a "media cell" to promote "takfiri thought", the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 people are accused of subsidizing the activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit has shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those of the Earth, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with a slower rotation, has led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface warm enough to melt lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the probe of the European Space Agency, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the Earth's potential future due to catastrophic climate changes.
Professor of Physics at Oxford University Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We are beginning to understand why Venus' climate is so different from that of the Earth, although the planets themselves are almost similar.
"Our new data allows us to establish a scenario according to which billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to the Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface."
Enriched uranium sequestered by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was sequestered by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer stated that three persons had been arrested and that the equipment was currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it is uranium, but revealed that the commodity would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to anything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to the task as a presidential candidate, to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates finally agreed to participate in the debate in You Tube, during which many ordinary voters who have registered their questions, submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, 28 November, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as the ones raised by another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked the Democrats for their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers reflected much of the conditions of the Republican party, the candidate in the next election.
We don't know what criteria CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose You Tube clips to show candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest one-themed debate, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they would hear pleasant things: The board noted increases in approval when candidates spoke rudely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who led the important early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his term as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of employing illegal immigrants at home.
Both fighters became particularly ferocious when asked if they would be willing to promote "amnesia" (offering clandestines regular status and the possibility of becoming citizens).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to delve deeper into this topic.
Neither of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have begun to fight immigration before and in a more incisive way than the others.
Generally speaking, candidates, at least concerning immigration, have the same opinions: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, combined with the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys made in China, or other fears towards the outside world, encourage Republicans to forget, or to minimize the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether to put water in the nose should be considered torture.
One speaker asked whether the candidates believed in the Bible in its entirety.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even if he is not sure to believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
It was not expected that Mike Huckabee - in a pole position in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - would declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When one insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to stand for election.
The human race remains unusually open to anything.
Huckabee's return to Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious search for grants led by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles during Wednesday's debate.
These two have emerged from nothingness, thanks to the fact that the two protégés of the party fail to agree to decide who is the best known and more traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly thanks to a message of success on American grandeur thus bringing the leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The pains of the Labourers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole to sink into; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, it is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra marital finger sucked.
But now a revelation attests that a wealthy businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister turned back on his election plan, stupidly insulting British intelligence that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democrat leader, said that the terrifying Mr Brown turned from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The acquisition of Northern Rock, a troubled bank on the edge of the crack, demonstrated a flaw in guidelines and poor judgment in an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from tax authorities, revealed an incredible administrative blunder.
A trio of retired generals have launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: they have proclaimed that being Minister of Defence is for them a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of suspicious donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the general secretary of Labour (and his former head of vigilance) have made them resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is bound for the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and they don't trust them, but usually leave their doubts behind when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a Prime Minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he risks suspension: the public administration no longer works; the cabinets of ministers take stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and without any more objectives.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his superior lieutenant.
Problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, relate to Brown's decisions when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's misfortunes, such as the lengthy investigation of party funds "cash money for members of the House of Lords", voters might think the opposite.
But Mr. Brown's difficult situation is not so tragic as it looks.
The gaffes are not so monstrous as the members of the Tories party make believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to make Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies a reality, always in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal about political donations is a good example.
Abrahams, a very special character, who compared his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it's not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of politicians' big subsidizers are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know who is contributing to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr Watt, who stated that he was aware of Mr Abrahams' programmes, without knowing that it was illegal, would therefore have to be questioned, as would Jon Mendlesohn, the fund-raising officer who had spoken of questionable donations in October.
But so far Mr.Brown is not involved: There is nothing to suggest that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned the legislative flaw of his party, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power rests on something he knows well, resorting to a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chair for the independent committee of the Standards of Public Life, without a leader for the past six months, and preparing a good reform on the financial side of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, at a time of weakness, to cooperate with the Tories, which could lead it to abandon its particular financial relationship with confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a partisan such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the election; it has two years to win back voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate irreproachable integrity and strong skills.
Card fraud.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see fanned fins, swirl around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fee and insolvency rates, which measures unrecoverable or unrecoverable balance sheet shares, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken $1.4 billion in consumer credit, partly because of the weakness of cardholders.
It's still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% in the third quarter is almost a point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in U.S. laws in 2005 regarding personal bankruptcy caused a sharp fall in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses to credit cards; the number of archives (and hence insolvency rates) could increase even if loan conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links of infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their indebtedness now that fair mortgages have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of cash than to the value of wealth, and therefore the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily led to a change in borrowers' credibility.
They could even bring benefits to credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if property costs less than the value of the loan; therefore, credit card debt would become a priority to pay back.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid takeover.
"We're not going to wake up one morning and reassess all the loans," said Gary Perlin, Capital One's director.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly face a macabre future.
Pay close attention to the dorsal fins..
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who had to testify to their roles in relation to a fraud committed by Enron's previous financial director, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially declared themselves innocent of the seven charges of alleged collusion in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam in order to enrich themselves in spite of their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all found themselves guilty of fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have become famous throughout Great Britain because of the two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, their case remains a pending issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges laid against them in 2002 made Fastow understand that he was the subject of the government's investigation into the Enron debacle.
The accusations against the bankers, nicknamed "Natwest's Three", claim to have come to Houston in 2000 to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his ex-right-hand Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of a Fastow-controlled Enron partner, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him rig bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the subsidiary bank for £1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 as interest for this company.
According to the accused, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But the truth is that $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the accusations, the bankers would have gotten $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison term in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released on bail of $1 million each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even propose its bogus speculations as profitable.
The collapse resulted in thousands of layoffs, more than $60 billion in loss of market value and more than $2 billion in loss of retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former general president Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to over 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were unsuccessful because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
No money, no money, no money from Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs as many seats as it is more of a family aircraft or for the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at last Friday's Gulfstream booth at the Millionaire Salon, a four-day consumer incentive orgy held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to cars filled with diamonds like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was looking at a brilliant orange Porsche displayed next to his stand.
"It's a pretty car, but nothing comparable to our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, such as Dallas"
"We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar from the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University."
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians emerge as the world's largest spenders.
The largest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are composed of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are worth $670 billion overall, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists from the economic and financial research center.
(The World Bank said that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweller.
She participated in the show for the first time with the Russian distributor, Le Groupe Bijoutier de Soho.
“ Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune. ”
Walking through the living room on Sunday evening, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 claim to be like their customers, millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and tried to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who grabbed her haute couture dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems above all to be aimed at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue in traffic to come to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum canifs, Mövenpick ice creams, personalized billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and cuddly bears Gund are on display.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and the best brands," said Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal factory stand for Dutch porcelain Delf, in front of a Raimbrant wall panel on blue tiles, handmade.
“it is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling”
In fact, sellers have stated here that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years are too much according to Russian standards) have already passed from brilliant logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not sell at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, either millionaires, millionaires' emissaries or tourists, walk through the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton inlaid with gold threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said he sold to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car drawn for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be encrusted with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, doesn't necessarily drive with such tires," Karapetian said.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There's more than you might think"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the booth of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company built four stands representing the British telephone booths, filled with counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passers-by arrested to throw masses of banknotes, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or poaching a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel a millionaire," said Mr. Karyev.
Unaccredited surgeon suspected of homicide in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window at Just a Little Healthier restaurant and observed an ambulance just stopped at the doors of the white Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," said Mr.Livingston, a restaurant manager on Wednesday.
That's when I realized someone died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the head of the Newark police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if the cause of his death is due to an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, who has not yet been identified by the police, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are waiting confidently for the results of the toxicology tests which, unfortunately, will take time, but which should resolve this mysterious death which saddened the senior ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been the assistant to the Director of Police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," McCarthy said about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"She was like a pit bull"
"She would have done everything to protect me."
McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she left two 14- and 11-year-old sons and a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesman for the Union County Public Prosecutor's Office, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical operation.
"It's a possibility to consider."
"the investigation continues."
Authorities said they arrived at her house around 3:00.
and found Miss Arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since then, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was interrogated by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if part of the house was being used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Miss Castro's house where a faded rose rests in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked in the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two all-terrain bikes hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since her arrival in Newark 25 years ago in the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her supervised political culture.
"She said, "You have to pay attention to this," he said.
"She was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
"It was embarrassing."
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates associated with the upsurge in the global stock market.
The shares are exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm down the credit conditions, subsequently reducing the interest rates promoted by the soothing statements of the vice president of the American central bank.
Stock markets explode in London, New York and all over Europe after Donald Kohn, #2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said those who decide must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in troubled financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets in view of these new credit pressures, Mr. Kohn stated that the recent turbulence has partly "inverted some improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
In the event that this severe turbulence persists, it would increase the likelihood of further rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into US markets, and that further reductions in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also calmed Wall Street with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest decline in real estate sales for the month of October.
The repercussions of this financial turmoil have been accentuated following the statement of Bear Stearns, investment bank, announcing that it will dismiss 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to the losing bets of the real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones' industrial average increased by 331 points, or 2.55%, to 13.289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points, or 2.7% concluding at 6306.2 adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the reappearance of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted following the strong demand for an auction of monthly sorting funds from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and inject further funds into London's financial markets, causing credit tensions, has led to the UK banks' monthly "Libor" debt-sorting rates, causing their highest growth since last September, at 6.59% following a strong recovery since November 12.
England faces a call for judgment in relation to the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the number 6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the selections who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because Hugh Morris's office, the CEO of England, is beginning to fill out the application forms to become a national selectionr, at least on a part-time basis.
Those who fail to win the No. 6 bib will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is unfair.
It is never easy to destroy what allows a man to get to the top of his profession while another will never get to the lower level, sometimes because of lack of luck more than because of lack of ability.
It is not only in cricket that the selection is difficult, because in the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is the time for Bopara to emerge?
Is it just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, who chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both new executives with good degrees, professional, should be promoted: but there is room for only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless he is given at least one chance?
Figures are important not only in decisions, but also in opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricketer of a day.
But capturing the eyes of selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself to be in great shape and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 laps to win a spot.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
If it is Shah or Bopara who will play at the Asgiriya stadium, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and did well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricketer of the Test, despite the fact that his double cent against Australia in Australia could still be underestimated.
Probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against young Bopara's exuberance.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable debut in the 88th Test in Bombay, 32 cents first class against six for Bopara, who at 22 years old is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at launch.
But Shah did only ten laps in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test to Lord, his Middlesex city, and that, the immediate rejection by the selectrs when Vaughan again in shape, claimed his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his so obvious moose in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy.
Nothing scares him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently overcame himself on a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, a sponsor of England.
He reported only slight injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his partner who looked at him from afar, to ask him if "he had seen this?"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his shooting look allows him to do services that suit him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right moment is another.
Perhaps this is the true art of selection?
I would be apt to give Bopara a chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will play this weekend.
Buses take people back to work, and fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dumping these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope that the city has returned to normalcy.
Some returned to fight the activists who distanced them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before Damascus arrived 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now."
"They say that the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to go away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from working.
His neighbours from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the militia helped by the United States, allowed him to drive Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his house north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm coming home today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been attracted by the growing calm of the capital since the American troops arrived, and to the view of continuous formation of "groups of citizens involved" well armed and working with the American military to defend their neighbourhood.
But still others say they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old, father of three, expressed the suspicion felt by all about the exiled visas that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, who reportedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people are said to have fled the country because of the sectarian death squads.
"We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," said the retired Sunni.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left."
The decrease in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis were driven out of the Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
There is a fear that a sudden influx of refugees will once again increase sectarian tensions and bring back the fighting.
Little Saar, good training.
The smallest Federated State conducts vocational training, and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
Only in one area is there a deficit for the Sarrians, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-derision, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland training system, which is placed fifth in the training instructor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies there by a double or even a triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high percentage of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Saarland also leads the country's children to higher-than-average numbers of higher schools - many of them without a Gymnasium diploma.
"In Saarland, we take advantage of the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, an expert in training at IW.
More than one in five young people obtain their diploma in a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
Thus the possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education in Sarrois has forced higher schools to undertake a marketing campaign in engineering science.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government has introduced comparison tests throughout the federated state.
For children to start learning earlier, the last year of day care is free of charge - a model that in the meantime other federated states also copy.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether students' performance is improving sustainably.
In PISA studies in 2003, the number of students at risk decreased from 29 per cent to 20 per cent.
In total, however, the Saarland has not improved as much as other states.
Bavarians are doing better.
And in spite of the sarrois, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise you could earn points in this area.
For the language of the neighbour is compulsory in high schools - even if the sarrois are not French.
Chávez sets watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon tick other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will raise the timer by half an hour in the South American country.
In the meantime, Chavez became a cartoon in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated, due to a new law, the watches will be set at less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
Anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would have no relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I can't, already because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is looking forward to a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's negotiating mandate on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe allegedly "cracked in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, criticized Chávez Sunday.
In Spain also Chávez is in every mouth.
A new cell phone ringing is a rage in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the internet.
It was pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was upset by the constant arrests of the left populists and who told him to remain silent.
A fall in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, there is a prognosis that real wage losses are threatening German employees this year.
Experts have cited a variety of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real decrease on their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The blame lies in the low growth of wages, the increase in value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research, in the newspaper "Bild".
New charges could also be introduced in the area of unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the projected drop in unemployment insurance of 3.3 per cent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial assistance, in the words of the SPD politician.
On Tuesday, it was known that the explosion in food and oil prices had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from year to year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere hostile to life, Venus looks more like the Earth than we thought so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind whirlwinds at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightnings on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has today provided proof of this - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lightnings on Venus burst at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of cyprine, lightning would have revealed life on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If life has been there, it must have been at a very old time in history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There should be few living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the infernal twin of the Earth, but she's still a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venetian research, since no probe had been on its way to explore this planet since the 1990s.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent results of research that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" do not only emphasize the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the commonalities with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than supposed at first sight.
Thus the researchers found, in addition to the wind whirlwinds already known at the North Pole, a cloud whirlwind at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon recalls the currents of air in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet described as an evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much more slowly on itself: a Venetian day lasts 243 earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly reminds the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets were formed under similar conditions.
On both, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth in the form of carbonate, it constitutes most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands the end of the quarrel between the parties about the welcome of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs for the attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and calls on the great coalition to close the dispute over the welcome of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the welcome of Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even though I have respect for differences between cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensible balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the reproaches that it would organise a new policy for China.
The German Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional policy of one China.
"China also knows," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the welcome of the Dalai Lama and was attacked outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained, in particular, about the CDU's "frontline policy" on foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama was welcomed to the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese relations.
Thus the Chinese government not only decommanded the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to Spiegel's information, also froze the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
China's Head of Government Wen Jiabao now demands that German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge that the Dalai Lama's welcome was a mistake.
China refused to allow European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official duties, thus supporting Wen Jiabao's Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama's words and actions would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fights with police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not break out in the streets by violence, the German Minister of the Interior demanded.
Burning barricades, breakers shooting at the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, the German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not form as much at home as it does at home and defuses itself into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "Neue Presse" in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated states and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, this already shows its first successes."
But it would be too early for an end to the alert.
Schäuble points out at the same time that in the German suburbs there are no sociological problems, nor from the point of view of urban planning as in France.
In northern Paris, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned down.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German government were demanded by the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasises that the unemployment quota for young people under 25 years of age with an immigrant background would be above average.
Above all, more places for training should be provided.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective".
The President of the Turkish communities added, however, that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many immigrant youth also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged, "But we still have to be careful."
Young people should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training.
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with searchlights.
Authorities reported three arrests, as well as a few burned cars and garbage.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the suburbs.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following night, the troubles overflowed in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
Angela Merkel's empire.
The utopian entry of the Chancellor shows that the coalition has finished with the bottom - and that there is nothing more to expect from her.
In what country exactly does this chancellor live?
After his desolating intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should ultimately be governed by it.
The criticism of too much focus on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said, and only showed that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it made it clear to everyone how accurate this criticism was.
There was neither concrete interest nor feelings for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a weightless politician, who fled into foreign policy and who even remained there in the vicinity.
For example, climate protection: in this area it welcomes again and again the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how climate objectives will have to be achieved in our country.
Even self-praising - having so little modesty, the CDU leader would have refused it two years ago.
Now she clings to formulas all made, that growth would affect people.
By this she destroys her image of a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the empire of the Angela cloud, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He has a few additional sentences left for that.
In this respect, it is indicative of the number of times she has lapsed when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three startups to pronounce a half-precise sentence.
She's ticking on unknown ground, from the moment it gets concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle - and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already breaking on the first subject.
He allegedly made New York a "shelter for illegals," criticises Mitt Romney for his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This one against on his side with heavy reproaches: "I would say that his own house was a haven for illegals" replied Giuliani and reproached the former governor of Massachusetts for having employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates mount the attack: as the Republican base also has no official favourites, the eight presidential candidates use CNN debates primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users sent via Youtube are just more than blowers.
"It was with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," said John McCain to his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also being taught vigorously by Vietnam's veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign in the meantime go beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture can be seen in the reactions of the common room in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whether conservative values are praised or future tax increases are denied, applause flows into the auditorium.
This is where again the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
"I made a mistake at that time," explains Romney contrit and apologizes to the base and the TV audience for having been a supporter of abortion again in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, passes through a noose when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian clothes.
One day after his withdrawal as head of the armed forces, Pakistani powerman Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of military domination end.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf was appointed on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live to the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the Nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his position as chief of the armed forces to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and had thus bowed to international pressure, particularly that of the United States.
Eight years after his takeover by a bloodless coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By this withdrawal from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf decreed on 3 November.
Already shortly after his inauguration Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another demand of the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers from its ranks, rejected last week all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of northern Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were injured.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on a street near the border with Afghanistan.
The Krautrock fathers are coming back.
The supergroups of Germany of the seventies replay: the three members of the group Harmonia took their console again in a concert in Berlin.
For their return they appeared recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced in the evening poster.
Each one has his little box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
He is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old in possession of a laptop and a guitar.
To the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes it inadvertently adds to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves too much.
The fact that the band Harmonia plays again has assured some months among the fans of Krautrock.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, of course, the name reasons in the collective memory of pop, but in no way so lasting so that this group misses so painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn't German also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the 1970s?
Especially since what is termed "Krautrock" has always been more popular in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded in 2003 the Echo Award to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, the room saw German pop faces interviewers.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the eulogy, the astonishment had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the stage of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the unknown is the one and only.
The memory is thus already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during this period, the impact power felt was much weaker than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly unpacked in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, who at the time was perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an old Weser farm, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Kommune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence like Spitzweg.
Allegedly there was in the trash a fanion of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many kept Harmonia away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next album was "De Luxe".
As serene and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered material misery.
The harvest of dead wood was not used alone in search of oneself.
The CD "Live 1974" which has just been released was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, as someone thinks he remembers.
Rother expressed at that time the wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral demand for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and assured his existence with albums like "Flammend Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
We owe the Griessem Live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its Grönland label aims to maintain the Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been dug up on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
Harmonia's physical resurrection takes place at the Maison des cultures du monde in Berlin.
Funded publicly as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire margin of fluctuation of the influence of Krautrock would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence hovers in the room in the midst of singular sounds: "The only real music, you listen to the future".
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the room of the farm.
Projections of other black and white photographs of bazaar-wired tools are used to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvised.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and the battery, to draw to the instruments unheard of sounds thanks to the instruments with effects built by themselves.
Today, electronic music resembles electronic music.
The three in great technical figurators.
Even the choir of the house will make no difference to this.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never been about rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in the conservatories of music (Can), in the technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia also is no longer irritated by this now.
But what is most self-evident will be carefully covered on the stage.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
This can hit someone's nerves (?) or allow fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "The Killing Peace", two films again tackle the Balkan war.
But both of them don't convince.
Either the projects rely too much on action and on the exchange of senseless shots or, on the contrary, they are too wretched.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news is that war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is precisely here, in the most gloomy hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is found.
Finally, we had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because far too many nice and futile roles in films with feelings for women and far too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument for still watching "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why do today's films have to be as long and confused as collective agreements for locomotive drivers?)
He gives a magnificent representation full of winks: deep down, his character as war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a ruined monument at its decline, has nevertheless kept visible remains of his old charm.
But in spite of this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Lead Peace", which is also released this week, the endless follow-up of failed films on the Balkan war.
The film talks about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from the Kosovar free-shooters, in which one of the two still falls in love quickly.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not presented for once as the only causes of all evils, this film as flat as a TV film is lost far too quickly in action and exchanges of senseless shots.
It remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why basically there has never been a real good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who condition themselves to track down the high war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, with another director and another writer (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go as a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for the two males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply do not let Simon Hunt be the cynical deserted with a heart, as he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute to her a romantic adventure with a Bosniak who was subsequently murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, achieves that NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters of the world have not succeeded in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him for just revenge to the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Court of the Hague should be seized of crimes against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) not to conduct the hunt intensively enough because of secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the wicked are this time so similar that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
This one speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compatissant, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiring it is to be mean."
Movies such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but they insinuate how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there has never been a good film on South Africa before.
This is worth every time: when a star hangs out on a hotbed or on a minefield, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits aller Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are simply too close in time.
In any case, decades have passed before Hollywood could make a good holocaust movie with "Schindler's List".
Some films still have to mature - those that today are worth classic works about Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have in no way been unanimously celebrated in their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we also know today simply too much about the conflicts of the world, where each hecatomb arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And it delights writers with the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The dictator" actually became so good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps we must have the sarcastic and distant artistic gaze of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It is only because certain things never change".
"Great cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be horrifiedly murdered and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust reaps the criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The mayor's setback with Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics was met in politics and the economy with virulent criticism.
Many want to continue fighting for the waterfront Games.
But Von Beust calls for realism in assessing chances.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, the chief director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described a drop-out on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
Recently, no other project had deployed as many motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympiads.
"Without this objective, the political-sport momentum could not have been maintained in the same way."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new point of departure for it in the longer term, "which takes as its starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday at his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until the year 2028.
"It's not Hamburg that decides to run for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the expected decision of the Sports Federation in early December on Munich's bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us, that in the time that we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance."
However the dream does not definitely belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
From this the impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A withdrawal of the candidature would also be in contradiction with the statements made by the head of the Senate when the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport was hosted in plenary session.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiades as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first in the past weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD fraction of the mayor criticized the Senate for not using this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Petit Grasbrook was refused by the Senate for years because it played the Olympiad card and excluded housing construction," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for the Petit Grasbrook to have a plan integrated into the Olympics and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics would have raised great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had broken up against Leipzig.
They're not Warhols' crates.
The one who connects Swedish concepts and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol’s list of works.
A large part of the ninety Brillo-Boxes of "Stockholm Type" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm today results in a disillusioning result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", whose former director of the Pontus Hulten museum donated in 1995 to the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Stockholm Type", which circulate on the international art market.
Ancient history is entangled, a disconcerting sequence of artistic and curatorical productions.
In 1964, Warhol created its first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, based on the red-blue-white design of the powder soap cartons "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo carpentry factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had indeed given permission in 1968 to produce a few wooden boxes in Brillo in Sweden, which were not, moreover, exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden crates that at the time would have entered by right into the history of art and auction, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the name "Stockholm Type".
Some of them have reached more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hulten museum falsely claimed, later, that about 100 wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would then have given to him.
In fact, Hulten's 105 crates were produced in Malmö in 1990 only, for an exhibition in St Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the museum's six Brillo-Boxes, three other Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminate panels were first printed and sanded, and then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The texture of the copies dating back to 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the paint was applied directly without a background layer on the laminate panels, using a roll of paint - moreover, it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic.
"These crates have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," says Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six crates in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
Already in July the Authentication Board announced, of course, that it would investigate the "heavy charges" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap crates.
But since then, we've been lulled there with an inexorable silence.
The Rebel Soldiers of Manila Abandon
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers abandoned, the same ones who had cut themselves off in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
The soldiers loyal to the power had shortly before stormed the hotel with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them were held in court on Wednesday due to a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly slip away with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently deserted in his favour and had joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The troops loyal to the government completed the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have had enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was in command before the Scout Ranger elite unit, said that other army units soon wanted to join the march.
Critics of the regime had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
Since 2003, Manila's finance district has been the scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
The insurrection broke almost 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a main shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 per cent in Versatel's telecommunications company.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as reported by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the share capital would be held.
We had previously speculated on a buyback.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step we seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet communicated.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institute would only hold the money for a third part, it is said on the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a stake of almost 10 percent in the mobile telephone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million on the stock exchange.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephony.
"We are strengthening our partnership," said a United Internet spokesperson.
Both companies founded the joint venture MSP in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, both companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not make use of their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent at Freenet, said United Internet on Thursday.
However, the two companies would allow themselves all the options open, especially to increase the stake in the SA Freenet, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
Poker still difficult to predict on Freenet, which has been going on for months, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers bound by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The Holding of United Internet and Drillisch so far held a direct interest in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring about an additional four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
