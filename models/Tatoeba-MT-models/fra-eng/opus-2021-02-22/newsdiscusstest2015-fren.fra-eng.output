The remaining UKIPs who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK for health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the unwanted.
First you use specious arguments, then you discredit them with barely veiled homophobia.
Every time I or my family need the NHS, we have to line up behind chronic hypocondria intolerants who think it's all due to them.
I think you're the one using specious arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing lunatics, hardly exists.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP's measures against health tourism, so there's no problem.
Only in the parallel universe of UKIP can Carswell appear as a revolutionary.
A quotation from a cloth does not constitute evidence.
Yes, then shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a specious argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when trying to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage's sentence was very surprised, but only because we talk so rarely about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to manage to get over it.
I'm not sure where you're going with this, but I guess you don't like it when the media talk about what you don't like.
We talk about it so rarely because unlike Farage and his crazy Thatcher followers who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, so no.
Finally, the situation is as rotten in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis that is coming the austerity period will not have fixed anything.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland's ''TIGRE DE L'EUROPE'' was praised a few years ago.
We knew the rest!
That's a good thing to read the article.
We are trying to make believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a ''NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE'' is happening.
With the agreement of Brussels, the lowest societies in Europe are subject to a very flexible labour market, an emigration which continues.
With these ingredients there is nothing to ''pavor'' for the moment with the coming of Poles.
In the 1980s of the 20th century, irlance was one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with the portugal In considering a constant perimetre, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
The Greek was in front.
That their development was not a long quiet river, it is on in view of the recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on enterprises.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
According to a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only small and medium-sized enterprises pay full costs.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars all over the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily traffic jams since the beginning of the year.
Is that supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon ignite.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a clash on the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon be buying a whole new fleet of aircraft, so some bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
Having said that, I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two once they're rafistoled.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair charge a surcharge to passengers for the additional fear we were willing to provide them with?
But without that kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can take it to heart.
Any article about Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair to those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the basic fare just have to go after themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair is not going to be happy with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether the passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that this was an error of the airport air traffic controllers.
The passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not as you say.
Have a nice trip.
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is mostly pedestrian, and literally teeming with people.
People do not come en masse for the quality of restaurants (mostly conques) or for the Salon de la revue à l'Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With many foreigners spending .....
You think Sunday's opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sundays, packed with people with 50% tourists.
@aloes False!
The only argument that seems acceptable to me is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is qualified by the fact that they buy tax-free.
Tourism areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons .
The industry remains where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right enjoyed by employees, with exceptions.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the minister responsible for the economy nor the minister responsible for foreign affairs have the slightest competence to reform the Labour Code.
Then they're shutting it down.
What's the point of the law?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies who wish to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday apm I take my grandchildren to the municipal library.
In my town of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is the access to culture ...
This is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life that he tenaciously defended against fascism
the way of life that he has tenaciously defended against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against her will, used to pay the estate fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some are not great.
Probably his estate would want his share of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Neither am I.
But for five years, and only for five years, he was perfect.
In 1940 He stood up to the other aristos of the government who wanted to discuss a "agreement" with the Nazis and he very skilfully won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting against fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, and of France, and of Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having had during those five years, just those five years, Churchill at the helm and none else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to raise the money from the estate fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them raise the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was "the moment of truth," Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only benefit large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, as infrastructure projects are by definition not renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the minister, they reflect the real French evil: distrust of dialogue
Back to princeps values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest of us not be in need!
Either in solidarity we come to his help, or he has RIGHT in exchange for the services he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to the Smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the lessor who lives from the income of his properties.
It is necessary to differentiate between those who invest for a return at the time of retirement and those who live from their pensions.
One good to rent or two for a couple on top, it's vice
The little genius of Finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of major works, but at a time of lack of large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline emerges in response to a recession that is only a wild and therefore brutal decline
You would have been right 30 years ago: no more need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investment is glaring: insulation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc.
A tax that favours high incomes and annuitants.
Who's in power?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallopin.
Samsung’s profits are damaged by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
AppleTM's mid-September introduction of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided on the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft implemented this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate design.
Some people attach no value to the design, for them the options, the functionality and the price prevail.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for "a better platform."
Is there "a better car manufacturer," not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
This is in our common interest.
I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it wasn't an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most of the people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, of course, Parisian bobos) could tell us which author(s) they fight ideas about gender and tell us the books they intend to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I like you, and you're an intelligent and educated person.
I said that about Judith in Furusato's vein evoking Holopherne, rapprochement that had not come to me (I don't have her vivacity of mind).
Otherwise, in the bottom, since you refer to it, I am not interested in this subject, and sincerely I do not see what the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my backwardness, because I am slow but I understand well...
@ Jean: acknowledge that culturally, sending Judith back to Holopherne, it does.
Who's afraid of the world?
But what do we fear those who are afraid?
Furasato and @ give us elements of response.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic slicer of the throat.
We can see how intimate these studies affect them.
Of course, we are no longer in the debate on ideas.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: With regard to an idea debate I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
Pretending to fight ideas on the basis of the only exposé made by their critics ( Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem to me to be very rigorous.
But well, as I was explaining to our friend umpfrontist, it's all the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I contented myself with the "Second sex" (it was more of my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and made up for a bit the disappointment of sometimes having the sight blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really enclose the Victoria and NSW coast, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Special flash blood moon.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey make the Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will return its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover the entire week with the rain of meteors from the Perseids and for virtually all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm starting to think there's a bad genius whose only goal is to keep the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are greatly improving on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn't see the eclipse because of the clouds over the suburbs of Melbourne.
I'm gonna put a TAX on this eclipse.
Whoever looks at this eclipse should pay a TAX.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when it ends up (forcefully) disappearing?
It seems that you spent a lot of time reading the discussions by looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse TWO of being obsessed.
Beautiful picture of the moon over Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Looks like Mars is colliding with Earth!
Nothing about stock market and real estate speculation.
Nothing about inequality between income from labour and capital.
Nothing about tax evasion.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about Babylon's gardens...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hyperlink to the original documents so you can get an opinion.
Go see today Tuesday, October 15 the results of miracle recipes: in Spain, exports have been at their lowest in five years.
In Greece the stock market is collapsing.
Yet these are the examples to follow.
The reform of the notaries would generate a claim for compensation of the order of 8 billion euros.
The Department of Economy tells us that these claims are not well-founded.
What if the Ministry of the Economy makes a mistake?
Will the decision-makers who have gained the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack by notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The rest in its time.
Okay, thank you, JYL....
@lol No The state is not comparable to households in terms of the management of its budget because the temporal horizon of the state is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifetime of its members.
Moreover, unless public expenditure is considered to be unproductive, it contributes to financing tangible and intangible investments that will ensure the growth of tomorrow and hence future revenue.
Some elements of the answer.
It's an unfortunate decision.
But remember Hippocrates' sacred oath: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth doesn't match your fantasy.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands tied by the law as written by politicians.
It is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical procedures, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these questions politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money with drugs Since the Liberals want our health care system to look like the one in the United States, you should find out how it works.
Doctors around the world are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame doctors, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to business profits and "research."
Read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme expenditures and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare world prices of drugs everywhere, as well as differences between countries on what is over-the-counter or only prescription.
This is reinforced by a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite laws that restrict them and expensive permits.
Although manufacturers of some drugs may not be happy with the use of alternatives such as marijuana, those who arrive at a version that offers good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a person in charge of this hospital.
We can't hold patents on grass...
If social science "researchers" were doing research instead of policy and networking, perhaps their "work" could be used.
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
Comparing is making pedagogy not research.
One cannot say "the research has been completed it must be applied" and then in the same jet "it is necessary to experiment at all goes".
If your research is successful, why experiment?
If your research isn't done, why are you asking us to apply it?
Can I be told how a "researcher" can infer that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could assimilate mathematics and other subjects more easily?
New technologies allow students to learn on the condition that they learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they don't know how to learn?
Pisa tests are just one indicator that makes it possible for us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What's the point of building an indicator that informs you of what's right for you, a will for self-promotion, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to keep sophists and ideologists away from training, and practitioners teach practitioners.
make read the paragraph on internships (which unfortunately is not very well argued) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most inefficient conservatism: "This is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of the practices in force, and that does not allow to advance the system " .
In view of the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be hoped that only practitioners will teach practitioners, even if they have a full place in modern teacher training.
Education theorists must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems in the education system.
Giving more weight to theoreticians of education would destroy it permanently.
Your analogy is totally messed up: if I would not like to be operated on by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, I would like to be operated on by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned on the job.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative Member of Parliament to Combat Copyright Violation by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaier thank you.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright, I'll just have to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = theft.
It is the same since they must cite their sources correctly.
Often, obtaining a license does not cost anything.
No, it's a copyright violation.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without the proper license, you deprive artists of their livelihood.
You can still argue about pedantic assumptions, but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, but it won't be true.
It's a copyright violation.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright
Obviously you don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for pictures used in school homework, an almost perfect definition of what reasonable use should be, then I'm happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson #1 should be to show how, if the children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the general conditions they have passed by one click.
Maybe if they share the headphones of their mp3 walker with a boyfriend on the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way.
Ah, if we could export that resource we're abounding in, the grunt that says it's all wrong...
If it's a PS MP who says so, then we have to believe it.
I have two children and when they are of choice, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by continuously assisting them.
I don't want my children to bear the debt this policy created.
What pulls France down is the speeches like yours.
@gus I have always worked in private companies.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I'm an employee because I know I don't have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the lame bosses I meet frequently.
At ease in my sneakers I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he is telling the horrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with the German companies that French entrepreneurs constantly cite to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large companies and medium-sized and small ones - What are the French bosses waiting for to do the same?
Let the state hold their hand?
This state they accuse of impericy?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-business couplet from you!
Remind me, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French entrepreneurs unable to create jobs and who are bouncing and minauding while waiting for the permanent assistance of the State!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, 45 hours a week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand lower wages if not their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
Which is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From what I see where I am, Last has not really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep afloat rather than transform.
That doesn't mean that the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do that, unfortunately.
I tried to get them recently, but I couldn't do it.
But, well, Labour's gonna get us out of trouble, isn't it...
It's an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
There is nothing to prevent people in the UK from starting a more moral business and participating in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the critics when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision was finally overturned.
And it's better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won Crossrail's operating contract for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally for pooling and sharing and believes that workers must all help each other across borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision ;)
Perhaps it is because the Dutch are on good track while the British are not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but, above all, new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"She was a beating girl."
God, I hate it, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being "beating" is a superior quality to many others, caring for others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "beating" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "beating", who are still dead, I know palanques.
Coming out of an illness has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, let's do it again.
I'm not telling you it's the condition to manage, I'm telling you it helps.
Nothing to do with any merit...!
When to the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'll do it again.
Insinuating, if only for a moment, that one can have merit to get out of an illness or that one can demerit not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that is loose, everywhere, in spite of the will, in spite of the confidence in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
I am sorry to think otherwise, if having a solid morale makes it easier to accept heavy treatments and to prepare for them, to try experimental treatments like this woman did and not to refuse them out of fear.
Someone who's fighting in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts medicine.
But if we prefer to rely on the "seigneur" it's something else..
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you get stripped to the point of becoming just a zombie.
Personally, I caught two of them, dirt, big ones, and if I "fighted" as those psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight is just to squeeze your teeth, to suffer hell and to take the blows.
I thought the accusation against Milosevic had been decided and finalized a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers in at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted "rapidly" and then swept under the carpet.
Is that the story we told back then?
The Communist who became a nationalist who started three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please question what we have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under THE MOINDRE rule of international law?
Which country did Serbia attack?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valuable target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended him, he'd be swallowed by the Western compressor.
The Westerners used a smokescreen to detach a part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was readily recognized by the Western states that then lied from end to end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term for failing to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
In the end, the Guardian should not call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we did not like him).
To my knowledge, there is only one method of predicting earthquakes in Greece that works roughly by measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This type of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
A hope, therefore, but caution is needed This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet called HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from the Earth in the constellation Cygnus which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules", according to a study conducted by the team of Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
Method to be followed, therefore.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat happen.
Thank you Passeur de sciences for regaling us, often, with these experimental prowess that are realized in the world.
How would animals know (in advance )?
Probably by the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas a priori odourless for man but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments at his disposal.
But we have no reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including hens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an arte report about the struggle of two scientific teams, one from California and the other from Japan, to have the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and in particular their modification before a seism.
So of course I'm not a scientist but their assumptions convinced me!
Where are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this trail?
We should learn to listen to nature again...
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious magazine, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by the animals, we come up against the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the goldfish turned strangely in circles.
I don't understand why you might think Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He's done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to LBC's program, you can't help but think that this man doesn't know anything about it and that he's still trying to distract with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor and he didn't keep one.
It just highlights how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, doesn't it?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because he's a celebrity and people have been taught celebrity adoration.
The Londoners voted for him, and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will burst the ceiling I'm sure.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but don't want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what they used to say about Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpaing, smarter than he
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French were truly and always disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have bothered to read some books (there are some, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "Strait of Scrap" speak, unfortunately as much as the dead who remained there.
It is understandable that Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, the Australia, must always be there from the bottom of the battle of Savo) do not want to go back.
We actually passed the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission is coming to an end.
It's the little ones.
But the Ecolo side is a total smoke.

Your recit makes me see again, by identifying myself a little bit in passing (I also learned to sail with the Crocos de L'Elorn at the Moulin Blanc in Brest harbour!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticise the impact of displacement.

Continue to make us see, and proudly show that the Bretons are great travelers!

Good evening I think that the red hat that demonstrated against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not spend a penny of our taxes on financing the dreams of some adventurers even as friendly as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian formation who are of Kosovar origin?
I know Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly at the Juventus and now at the Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still on the team.
Bisevac is Lyon's defender, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfielder or before in the 70s and 80s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in the great team of Velez who, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also had sizes like Vahid Halilhodzic and the loyal team member of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at the Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *fisson*
Now I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he's not a member.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is, the flag of this drone isn't the flag of real Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all the regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (which I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give parts of the country to the neighbouring countries.
How can one feel "an explosion of joy" when two towers collapse knowing that women, men and children without doubt are inside?
How???
What bothers me a little in this "testimony" is that the mere fact of having been able, at least once, to spontaneously rejoice in the horrible deaths of thousands of people, testifies to my eyes to a "border line" personality whose "testimonies" should be taken with the utmost caution.
No doubt that in the short moment of "joy", one will not have thought of the dead or of the reality of the horror inflicted.
We just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to do truly and apocalyptically evil to the great wicked Satan in his very heart.
To do qqch of powerful.
Great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims who feel humiliated.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We thought so.
The Western "Christian/White/Walk" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the musuman when he contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Arab Muslim world.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the Dubai towers.
Past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How do we get the Muslim world out of this evil funnel?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigate the Arab world l: the bigot conservatism of the powers in place and fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freeze of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
That we have understood it before, must not push back the Muslims.
It's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I guess that's true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long, dark, damp and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls a weekend.
We've had a great summer this year, don't be your grumpy clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now I'm retired and I'm no longer developing immunity to outside germs, that may change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a febrile that culminates with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and many other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and grey months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child supplements , the amount received by the State comes mainly from deciles 8 to 10 .
However , with regard to the number of households that have seen their taxes increase as a result of this measure , it is above all deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to Chart 2 .
The elimination of the half share concerning especially widows is not at all dealt with in the article or rather its impact is completely undervalued: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And that's not gonna work it out.
Well, we're not on straw, but dreamers.
For once the PS makes a rather left-wing policy we're not going to cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let's continue this way and you will encourage these 20% less to work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live Trots and OCI recycled to PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you don't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population holds 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it forbids anyone to collect as much as they can.
Beyond a certain limit the money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money is exceeded, money is used only to make money, that is to say to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We're one of the richest 20%.
Probably also of the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, some of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or just as much to give up and live on social minima, especially if you have social housing.
The utopias of the head cutters with the red Khmer have fortunately lived.
I did two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or deal with any hassle.
All you have to do is go to someone's house, sleep there, put back behind you and go back.
From now on, this will be my first option when I'm on a trip.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need some kind of landlord insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, six hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" No, it's not true.
You just really missed luck.
Based on the link provided in the article:
In its discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an e-mail provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
Then why does this article quote Teman complaining that he received no support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hi I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I'm thinking of paying a down payment and a month's rent at once but I'm a little afraid to send £1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
"Supporting the troops," sang the Bu$herie in every tone...
That's a harmless weapon.
I am sure that it will please the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurdish people who died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not very clear the style of the author: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think this is the time to weaken the army to strengthen education.
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: This is ALWAYS the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if "they" were to work 35 hours instead of 17.
At present, our teachers are earning more than engineers.
And don't make us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their curriculum.
But it can't be seen since the National Education does not have the resources to provide an office to the college/lycée to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in short, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, internet connection or supplies.
Besides, it's so much the hideout at 5 p.m. a week and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill the CAPES with math, come on, we're waiting for you.
What do you mean, you don't want to pummel undereducated bastards whose parents spit on you by calling you a jerk off?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the Kurdish population can flourish better.
Where we see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first graduate job was in sales in London, earning three times nothing and yet it was a position for which a diploma was required.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London subway, it was paid £5,000 more a year and we didn't even ask for a patent.
I never regretted it.
In this regard, don't worry if you don't find a graduate job, try to find something that pays well or that you like to do.
If I had stayed in graduate jobs, I would still have to pay my student loan.
I don't really like working in a company, so I hope to eventually move on to either the public service or the academic world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of bisounours as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political science, that is to say what we call the diplomas of unemployed people.
I've got one of those degrees and I'm a production manager.
It turned out that the important thing was not the diploma but, as the above article says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course the starting salary was lower but the steps are rapidly rising because in the real world what counts is results more than knowledge.
This debate engineering studies / artistic disciplines have lasted for years.
Scientists can't solve all the problems, it's more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people to get results.
Letters, philosophy and art are branches of bisounours?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about diplomas like media studies or whatever kind of abscond you went to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real subjects.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn't it be better to have a real territorial policy to relieve the congestion in Paris and boost the rest of France?
Personally, I don't see the inhabitants of the end of the Essonne and Val-d'Oise making 80km return every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
The inhabitants of the inner walls and the small belt already have many means of public transport that are much more convenient (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and locked parks, as already exist in the cities of northern Europe, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
We might as well benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we couldn't find a place for ONE bike hooking device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, that's not good at all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other public transport users the reasons why they don't pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that come out are: 1/ it's super dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that ride super fast and don't care about the survival of the bikes 2/ we get full of pollution in the head For me the bike paths are worse go, we have to reduce the traffic (urban toll type congestion load), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), enforce the code of the road by systematically verbalizing (even bikes at the flat level although it is necessary to adapt the code of the road written for cars 100 years ago to the bikes), generalize the buffer zones after the nailed passages, not before otherwise cars and scooters do not bother.
Bicycle paths are apartheid, we must coexist but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Anything on the bike in the big Paris?
Not a word about the place of cycling in public transport?
EELV is right.
The goal of 15% turnover at the bike is ridiculous.
I'm starting to think Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
In fact, according to OR, the EELV deputies seem sceptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find out who is really behind this massacre.
It's not Russia.
I'm not sure I like the way the world is evolving.
That sounds awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer has expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
In addition, they should file a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the authority responsible for airspace security, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been shot down earlier, Ukraine launched air attacks on the rebels in the area, and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with innocent lives so that airlines pay overflight fees?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurper government / the ultranationalists of western Ukraine - and who want to basically demonstrate that Putin shot down the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The previous one: a 1986 ruling of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the supply of arms by the CIA to the Contra rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There's no way Russia's gonna let this case go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think that Abbott wants to tell Putin that Australians have been murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations.
So far, investigators haven't said anything like that.
To be called Ricardo and to be such a beetian in eco, it's distressing!
Calling Polar is losing the north is rejoicing.
Only one question from beetian: is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I cannot help noticing that those who most virulaly criticize Piketty's book have not read it!
It's easy to read, it took me a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of income from labour, property of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of today's capital joins that of the beginning of the 20° before 1914, it shows that it is the 2 world wars that reduced the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: you say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this cobblestone knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limitations.
Secondly, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is fair, one can debate it without having read the book whose essential thing is to argue in a one-sided way in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of its pavement summarized by the press false?
I haven't read and won't read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and it is this one that seems to me pure fumistry.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Hasn't humanity all of a sudden been enriched?
And this enrichment, together with an increase in the population, is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the prize without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age at which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this prize will not be a burden on the girl and that she will find her way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old saying that coloured perverts are the embodiment of evil.
All my best wishes to Malala, but she must realize that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the working-class neighborhoods of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she were not where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Isn't Malala herself part of these "colored perverts"?
You should not have any "airtime" on this site.
You yourself are a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father ran a school where girls attended school and was in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, for her to receive a higher education and to have the right to decide her own marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he believes that women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at 14, without having a say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it eloquently enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at the age of 14.
Rather disappointed by this entry into season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who obviously has a little trouble finding her character of Marlene Dietrich.
I just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and the show by Jessica Lange singing Bowie's anachronistic Life on Mars is simply stunning.
I haven't seen this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I prefer to have all of a sudden just watch 13 episodes spread over 3-4 months.
But one thing is certain, apart from Jessica Lange extraordinary, it is above all the risks of staging and editing that amaze me.
We have in AHS an avalanche of original plans that ridicule the asepticization of today's productions.
I don't like to see you throw the sponge in advance for the next few seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge its quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say it so well, there are many other things.
No, it's just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series apart from the technical qualities.
And well, I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, it wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's gonna end up like 24 hours.
But everyone does what they want!
It is by what I say "I will no longer look" that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I simply share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think it will be fatal.
But after that, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - let's cut in government spending instead.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to save money failed.
To trigger controversy over relatively small expenditure items, such as development aid
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of direction that voters seem to be calling for, and throughout this time some in each camp pretend that these nuances are far more important and substantial than they are - and voters see their game clearly and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditures.
“Debt” is assets held primarily by financial institutions in that country.
"Debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government taking over a third of my income (before even talking about consumption taxes) if I thought he would use it wisely.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest on how to reduce taxes, but if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to wind turbines that are almost useless and nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should, you come to a figure that makes the tax of Labour and Lib-Dem on the most luxurious homes seem ridiculous.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 a year will pay about £5,000 (one seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (one fifth), etc., and someone with £20,000 will pay about £70,000 (just over a third).
What about social security contributions?
Plus social contributions, plus local taxes, plus parking fees and car stickers, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is collected at source before local taxes and the car sticker.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let's not pretend that money falls from the sky, or that it's not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes pass.
How can an unemployed person looking for door-to-door work prove it?
Even so, 20% of the unemployed wouldn't look, which means 80% look and don't find.
Being unemployed myself, do I have a greater interest in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances as much.
Indeed, I haven't heard from Emploi in months, does that mean that agents are more busy in control operations than really getting job advertisements in?
I don't see the point.
Because it's not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough jobs, then it is necessary to do without Pole Emploi.
How is it a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case it is ensured that the unemployed fulfil their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks the users of a means of transport for their transport title, a head of department or the employees of their work, etc.
Nobody shouts scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to recall that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had to deal with Pôle Emploi, my rights to ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, cut by 40%, it had to fight hard.
It takes time!
I'm not a law expert.
The fiche and control currently take over, while statutoryly Pôle Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern the employees, it is they who pay the costs.
Politicians and non-salaried French people grant themselves rights that they do not actually have!
It's not normal.
I would add that decent unemployment insurance contributes to the enhancement of paid work.
More than waiting for murderous tweets in Arabic...
In fact, we must have a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the black plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit to ban this year the Hadj in Mecca to Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 people had their visa applications refused because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of spirit.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from flying to Europe?
I thought it was simple common sense, but apparently those who "know" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be kept under strict quarantine.
No one's going out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they're there, they stay there until they're cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were infected after having had contact with people in West Africa, although they took "all the necessary precautions."
We can stop the progress of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let's not let them offer to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with symptoms typical of Ebola, so that they can be immediately quarantined.
That he manages to convey the message of the first individual and of the second group (including religious) and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is capable of erecting in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It is still far from that conception there.
It has only been 20 years since information appeared as humanity's prime, while religion, born of the cerebellum, has been directing our actions since Lucy perhaps.
What is the point of becoming an umpteenth Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to adhere to it.
Those who criticize would not set foot to the Church anyway, there is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
@louise: Sorry the church has no limited vision to France.
And in the world, maybe that will make it possible to reach more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you see it existed before Christ.
Hillel a century before him already said: "Do not do to others what you do not want us to do to you, this is the whole Torah and the rest is only comment: go and study!".
Christianity goes far beyond a mere reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "promote justice, peace, brotherhood" but without god?
Is this a return to communism? :-)
Next step: take away the incarnation and the resurrection.
Jesus will remain this hero who has changed moral laws by redefining the respect of others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and advance justice, peace and brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then forcibly converted and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant about buying this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It's not made up.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even took part in his fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The hackers in the computer department block all the cool sites.
Hello, is it £30 then 20% discount, or does the £30 include the 20% discount?
Note however: the PC version is only for DX11.
It caught me by surprise, I bought it, but can't play it.
Plus I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it sucks.
It's time to buy a new video card.
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that someday they'll erase it from your library if they decide to go against the people who buy it there while they're out of the area.

Thus, was France of 1940 a "putrid land"?
Say, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
We must love France of 40, that of "the strange defeat"?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize in literature, you wonder whether Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, you don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano which is already difficult to read in French and which describes a universe so limited and so egocentric?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt that.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant connection with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They'll be able to appreciate Mr.
Modiano's worth it, if they don't already know him!
For your part, continue to associate with Lévy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso retain all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hi, the awful ones.
Ever since I drove one to Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing followed me here.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the beer and cider festival in Nottingham.
It was a mess.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not only CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with the camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather's place to play card brag.
Thanks to a real beginner's chance I was able to leave with several decent bets.
I hope if I get to 95, I'll be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a fancy cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came in with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire Mr.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
Having said that, I don't want to upset you, I think you're moving a little away from the subject.
This famous whole, it forbids quests for jihadists at the exit of mosques.
It immediately reports arms trafficking.
Either we have eyes wide open like Meddeb and Taïa or Boubaker or we have eyes wide closed.
You have to choose.
It's not by keeping your eyes closed that you get to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you are making a monumental counter-sensing: all the representative authorities, organisations or associations, Muslim or not, having formally condemned the IS and its crimes, the French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
That doesn't say word consent.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, there is doubt for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval of the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt it.
This principle is, in my view, the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the breakdown of French society.
If there is no doubt, you might as well say so.
Who says no consent, but consents to what?
Consent to proximity to IS or conviction of IS.
Silence is practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to keep the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster because there was a huge gap between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified at the idea of losing all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't care about Scotland because they don't sit there.
They can do what they want with electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's gonna shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMESSE" thinking that he was saving his party but without realizing that he was signing the death sentence of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs hold their leader to account.
If the SNP gains 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they have promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's more important.
Not if Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Shining the pumps by 8% at the expense of 85%, this is not a super election strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs are no longer able to vote on matters relating to England, the Conservatives will win all votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists and it did her good.
However, he is still in the running to be prime minister in 2015 and since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is "The lives of others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
Ultimately, this will at least have a sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next post: Amazon manufactures YOUR book based on YOUR profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's gay as a world.
Strongly stimulate.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have to read pirated files, books in the public domain or purchased from some publishers who have the intelligence to propose files without bugging.
Given the price I paid for the Kobo, it's without regret.
I am amazed at the widespread abdication of users in the face of widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your general public bookseller, you will always notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are probably derisory.
For example, James Joyce's Finnegans Wake.
@Thomas: In the era of Big Data, data doesn't really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in the same bac.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile....
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that are used, allowing neither readers nor authors to be identified.
But Kobo has all this information.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be run by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenic children on acid.
It's even worse if you take Erdogan's religious fundamentalism into account.
It is interesting that some Erdogan supporters think that Islam is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey doesn't want to shoot herself in the foot, unless it gets something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will respond, so it's actually shooting itself in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: "The PA reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be a mistake to try to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran is sending a serious warning of reprisals or merely advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises us is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region."
Indian Punchline's reading is highly recommended to anyone who pays attention to the details rather than to the c*nneries balanced by the traditional media. The short article you give the link to is important and should be read with in mind the realistic observations / previous warnings coming from Iran to propose Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderates" who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time ISIS's perverts?
Pipeline policy pushes the world to the edge and I would suggest to those who refer to non-existent "moderates" to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
"It's even worse than that if you take Erdogan's religious fundamentalism into account" Are there any other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I've got one in mind.
There should be a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Is it "need"?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have any chance of being alive?
A little late for that, buddy...
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like 120 years?
A little late for that, right?
Particularly with regard to the CUP triumvirate that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after World War I by revenge by Armenians, and Enver killed by Bolsheviks in a lost place in Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of establishing there a Turkish empire.
What a delusion!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek in vain contact with the real.
All clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even in the womb of a surrogate mother.
Lesbian couples may just have a child's desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterile hetero couples, too.
As for the children!
What a shame to call them psychologically unbalanced futures.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their living and to pay the pension of this lady (?)
GPA is probably a provisional "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
It's not from today.
Many women brought and gave birth to children who were not their husbands'.
It is still so, we are so done...
The important thing in this area is that this practice is framed so that the "marketization" of the body is limited.
But esthetic surgery, aren't cosmetics as commodification of bodies?!
Anakronik Fareinheit ...
It is certainly more elegant to make a maid grow up in distant countries via the internet and Pay Pal than to shoulder her responsibilities and or to avoid the scandal in another century near home without shouting it at that time on all the roofs! ...
These practices were also not made in the name of the church! ...
There are not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices ...
Nevertheless, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh, shut up, this man is passionate about something.
In the late '70s in the Midlands I only saw this from afar.
I had to go during the day because I wasn't allowed to go at night!
But if you like it and listen to music - this music today it always touches you as much.
I don't know why there are so many disdainful comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think there's a football article in the sports section that's waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there has been a shortage of stories that truly reflect the reality of the culture of Northern England.
No wonder Paul Mason grasped the social and political context, he understood things well.
Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can listen if you are in the London area in November: 99psoul is going to go soul vinyl again, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story", but here's a little article well written and well thought out.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're glad you escaped Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.
Gobbling pills.
Whatever the station before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes walk from Wigan after buying a ticket to the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the police series George Gently entitled Gently Northern Soul, which takes place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is getting more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace since he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (as Rabin was also the case).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their constituents have all preferred occupation-colonization over peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock, and entered into the water.
An Israeli had stolen them from him.
The Israeli representative got up angry and said, "What are you talking about?
The Israelis were not even there at the time!".
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established.
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not let down the guard ...
That it displeases the anti-Israelis is obvious, that is not the goal sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And this is still the case since the Politics is globalized ...
Avoid, avoid...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it certainly persists!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What balance of power has allowed Israel to be created?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a balance of power!
Do you doubt it?!!! ...
Besides, this isn't all about Russell Brand, but the Guardian journalists seem to be having trouble going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
A lot of what he says are just pseudo-chomskyist logs written no others.
That proves you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a series of personal attacks and innuendoes (my 13-year-old daughter likes her, which means it's a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand is telling some truths, maybe truths that you prefer not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand Horripile some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but this whole non-voting thing has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and instead to cross arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos that he posted, he says that voting once every five years only for Labour or Conservatives (or Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting democratic engagement to that is completely useless, the two parties (to a slightly different degree) ruling essentially in favour of particular interests, multinational companies and the rich, at no time does he say simply to ignore politics completely because these parties do not govern on our behalf: he insists that rather than just voting and disconnecting for five years, people should become much more politically active at the local level, organizing movements, demonstrations, petitions, whatever and trying to influence politics from this.
I'm not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think being politically active in making his demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are weather vanes who will change their minds if they really risk losing the elections), but it's furious to see all these condescending answers that say that this fool who makes Jesus tells the young people not to bother voting and just to hope that everything will get better because it really distorts his arguments.
Its solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people were to debate what it really says rather than simply label it as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of it and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The voting thing has been completely distorted.
The pointlessness of dragging a ballot into a ballot box every five years makes me deeply upset because my vote really matters for nothing.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and Members who report locally to their voters.
In addition, I dispute the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his (written by others).
He is intelligent enough to have his own words and ideas, even if they are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "Pseudo-chomskyist marbled".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, let Suzanne do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, even with the head hoops added to the editing!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russel but eventually became one of his fans and invited him on his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he's going.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This "frond" reveals above all to me that the intellectual debate is no longer held for a long time at the meetings of history where professional historians have become a minority and where exchanges of specialists have become impoverished to the benefit of condensed ready-to-think Sciences Po type for press kits.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to attack a guilty man, a scapegoat.
They develop both very rational reasonings, but this rationality rests on these scapegoats who are the cornerstone of their thinking.
Rather, I believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as guilty.
This is a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also the magic thought.
We solve the problem of the relationship to each other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchizing slope, neo-lib and / or /libertarian (of the two terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing how to seek the help of the state for its markets) in the sense of at least state / no state at all at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organizes beautifully.
His thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt it does not stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a stand against the three intellectuals cited here.
Or support, by the way.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old times, that of its then god, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a cabbage too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an advocacy of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel by this means...
Gauchet raises a profound reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the membership mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he's an original and respectable thinker.
Seeing this cabal orchestrated by researchers in the humanities of the hard left who can't bear to do without allegiance to their mantras, is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is boundless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other "yellows" I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I last saw a Chinese man.
In London and they were nice to me when they found out I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same thing about whites!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them speak violently anti-white.
My dad's not happy his older daughter's dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity is spreading outside of major cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, the Russians mostly have prejudices against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or to face high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the River Ienissei, in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard Australians' views on Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I can't stand the Chinese, while I've met two in my life (including one abroad), didn't keep bad memories, all people are worth it and, in fact, those in London were very nice, that's the only reason I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don't remember who we meet, all people are worth it, how to remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here speak of the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with the so-called white.
How many Chinese men are with whites, by comparison?
None, because there's a lot of chance that the parents of these whites would assault them PHYSICALLY.
No measure of the impartiality of the justice system.
However, it is the mother of all the battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked to the left like the trade union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: I'm sorry, but the legal community is frankly branded.
As for the Union of the Judiciary, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of bias can be made on the basis of the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it orders the removal of two obstacles.
That of the observer's political vision and that of the magistrate's factual interpretation.
It remains then the mandatory tool of the law to refocus the assessment on fundamentals.
The measure of its non-observance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, forces a distinction to be drawn between the error and the partiality of magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice were not divided among these three groups.
The claim and the lack of knowledge are not part of an objective analysis.
And if all this is not analysed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If it is only by statistics implicitly revealing that it starts from very low.
The previous preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
Corruption* of the judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The field considered is that of the plundering* of heirs committed up to the means of frauds to the procedure* by genealogists estates mandated by notaries.
This profession gets 150 million euros a year while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
In order to understand their mechanism, part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this joins the so-called statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, it is that the judicial institution has produced, during many disputes between genealogist and heirs reluctant to be so robbed, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all laws favorable to heirs.
Is it not then that the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria is an elaborate form of lies?
Prices must be totally prohibitive.
More equipment to scam people with disabilities.
You can say that, but my brother has one of those all-terrain tricycles, tailored to his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never a normal wheelchair, with bulky wheels and tires, couldn't.
As they say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
Tankchair looks EPIQUE.
I don't think the inventor of the Whill ever had to clean up a dog filth on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the all-terrain tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a longboard penchant.
Here there are hills that they would like.
Prices actually look high, but there are really people who put that kind of price on a bike, so "you see."
The all-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all disabled people are poor, however.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance at their disposal.
Only if they've become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford high prices for things they know they are needed for us.
You can't really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it's just a draft, it's not intended to be manufactured.
I'm CONTENT that the "long distance" wheelchair doesn't get to the market, because apparently there's no way to drive that damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying Power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half of them are children and young people under the age of 18.
The eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade!
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation, an illegal situation as well, since this blockade imposes a “collective penalty” on all civilians in Gaza.
"The entrepreneurs who work on their projects divert a little bit from their cement to the black market " ...
Ah, that's not the tongue of wood, rather concrete and armed the lady...
References are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, that's for sure, and recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world that is unacceptable to anyone with a heart and moral sense.
The United States has a well-kept land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded him!
Remember also that after lifting it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Bloc is Israeli-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built to the reverse of the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought about it.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the not-for-profit sharing economy.
Many are only looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping) in another way.
It's always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, owners and tenants who trust each other often stop using Airbnb and treat directly in cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this?
"What she hires out of"?
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
The verb "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you haven't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure that it is 100% compliant with all safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to practice a commercial activity there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc.?
The barges are so slow that if someone tried to steal it, it would still be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our barges...
Where are you going to moor it?
No, Marine Le Pen's not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than the one that exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
Increasing wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to get poorer!
High finance, speculates, plays with our companies so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our foodstuffs so our food, with the care structures so our health, with our debts so our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold..
All this for the benefit of a few hyper-mega-obeses of money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former minister of the economy at Rothschild Bank, in order to better defend the interests of bankssters, who were the only ones responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no one else competent?
What do you call it? Turn over his jacket, put down his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
Actually, we don't really know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I'm not sure Spee really "refused" to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was rough at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Falklands, where, in the photos showing survivors being rescued, we see a calm sea in broad daylight.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, that's not exactly what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two battleships, which had disappeared in the dark after stopping the fire, and a chase race began.
Leipzig saw something on fire, but as it got closer, it saw that it was only a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, leaning and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his spotlight on the ship's flag, the proposal to surrender was refused and he opened fire, finally pouring the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged that the Good Hope had escaped and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Worried by reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he set off north."
So, if that is true, the Germans, groping in the dark before the radar was invented, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not look for survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have severely damaged them, so in confusion they went out to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they would have to make their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already harmed them and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes are raised at the UMP to ask that it be enshrined in the law that an elected person who has been finally convicted should therefore be permanently ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect left-wing politicians of course.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEE I PROPOSE A REGISTRATION FOR THE CONS OF THE MAGISTRATES
When is the ban on trade unions in sectors already protected?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to taunt those who will take advantage of their irremovability to hinder the actions of the real politicians, who are really trying to move things, not the beautiful female speakers whose immobilism is commensurate with their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around midday with their little billboards "subs for justice" they came from the provinces and did not make the difference between Bercy and POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of his party.
It would not defend the same arguments if right-wing and even far-right trade unions were to target personalities on its side and wage a legal-media war against them.
Your statements are totally free.
If, at present, the right defrays the judicial topicality, it is simply that it has committed acts that fall within it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with Justice, but not everyone who has been the subject of his attention has had any special treatment.
On the other hand, it must also be remembered that the judicial union, which is left-wing, is not the only judicial union and that it is a minority.
That a minister supports unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you cite may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at the Chancery, it is not a secret.
We now wonder whether the "mission" of some judges is not more dirty than instructing.
@gus - You should be satisfied, SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Peony: you forget that magistrates are not civil servants like any other: they are the only ones who have the power to impeach and imprison the whole-one-each.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the most glory-hungry idiot realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I'd be surprised if someone would accept their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
One Direction fills the stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, has launched Chreyl Cole, who is in fact one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Celine Dion, Cliff Richard, all did the Eurovision competition, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the British television's light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that's what happens anyway to most of the stars who don't participate in the contests.
Rare are those who, after a tube, succeed in making others.
In any case, most singers/groups can expect at best three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the UK.
His celebrity comes partly from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock path, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar-smokers who smoke grass in their father's garage and swing three chords on a primary school poem will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before even releasing an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that quickly turns to racism, because the sacralist ethnologists present these faraway people as infinitely superstitious and mingled with ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing things are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, from practical considerations in everyday life.
Except you're imprudently interpreting in the opposite direction.
Either, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it better not to admit that our Marianne and our Molières also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as recalled to see the sacred as a kind of object well defined and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article in any case.
It's deco ephemere to furnish the void.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw to the nettles interpretations not at all scientific that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When does a comparative critique of disciplines make you laugh a little?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is quite unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, precious testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and before archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and their knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Nowadays, we have such efficient technical and scientific means that the interpretation of excavations is better but can always be questioned by other discoveries!
We are there in the middle of (and old) polemic on shamanism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (see his book "The shamans of prehistory", especially the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published by La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this informative article
Straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could get started.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't keep on with three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we're not against a play on that.
We couldn't watch a musical on that, however, it would be too gay!
We could expect that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost complete, may I suggest you move on to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we are all looking for a newspaper that pays real, courageous journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own peril.
Instead of making a laugh with these childish ass jokes.
Not very clever.
Go away then.
If these "childish ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
You also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or is it the fact that people laugh about it?
Nevertheless, we find the amateur crash video on the net...
amateur crash video on the net... ??
If the FOM chose not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no way those of the pilot.
Had the FOM wanted to protect the pilots, it would have pulled out the safety car when another vehicle (e.g. tow truck) entered the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it appropriate to advance the time of departure (right TV, advertising, money...).
But other than that, they're good at protecting the pilots.
Well, I also share that view.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have at the restaurant a chance to beat the English who led then...
You let go of this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I've got a little time to flush out all your shit.
No, just no.
There have been lots of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts commissioners in danger of death for a distant story of the possibility of victory of one pilot at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that releases safety because it's the FIA.
Size nuance.
In view of the amateur images, the absence of an image allows the FIA above all to avoid the annoying questions of the type: How is it that the commissioner shakes a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one of the commissioners is clearly seen waving a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that one is more under the yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark misconception of F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under a yellow flag AFTER the place of the accident, hence the agitated green flag.
That's the usual procedure.
The clerk station just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters as it is 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal pace.
Sensationalism sells advertising.
Before I thought that the media were an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid that, in the end, it's just for the money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, fear of not having a sex life, advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The news does exactly the same thing.
Doing the buzz with information we really don't need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so we can keep controlling them.
"When the tabloid coughs about Ebola, we all catch fear" It should be "derailed", not "coughing".
Given the medical reference, "coughing" is much better said in this context than "derailing".
I wonder if all the people who panic that Ebola could start spreading by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You do them too much honor.
They probably think this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You're confusing Ebola with Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that beautifully and solidly ridicule this abject pseudo-journalism.
That made me laugh.
I'm depressed that the media are talking about most things with this optimism backwards.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently scared and anxious (without reaching hysteria) for the government to get us to slip when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we have to suffer a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it itself invented.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be still in this world almost 35 years later.
Besides, at first it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980-90s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of going there for years .....
There's no need for testimony.
As always when you talk about science.
Not only do testimonies serve no purpose: taken alone, they cannot be used as a scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@traffic: Testimonies cannot be used as a scientific material.
This may be why patients in psychiatry are not asked questions when they have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my mother psychiatrist explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's a subjective testimony that doesn't matter.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is useless in a scientific approach?
So, what do you base the research on, then?
On fantasies?
You put at the same level fantasy theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies) ?
"Resilience": the phony word adulated by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who think they are great psychologists after reading D'ansembourg.
@Jim: There are plenty of empty buzzwords in psyches.
Cyrulnik made us the blow of "resilience".
Since he's a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he's briculated us with a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and Company??
Doesn't that remind you of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to bring Sentinels out of the air...
And why is that?
It was a great show and it looks like those who come out of it are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they going to make the kids hook up?
The only solution that comes to mind is humor like pee-caca, which would kill the show.
It was already a children's show.
The kids were hanging out.
Ah, because it's a children's show?
UKIP works for the Mysterons.
Why don't you keep your Team America?
Still in Supermarionation?
It won't be the same if you don't see the threads and the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although being an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain to re-diffuse old people.
The show has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; we have had episodes of one hour on Saturday and Sunday at 6 a.m. for at least 40 years.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it has been on one of the second-rate commercial channels and can still be seen at these times.
And in addition, half an hour episodes now pass at 5:30 am, Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a "sad" 60-year-old dude, but I don't watch this show every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the esplanades !!!
Radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations under and around the mosque of the esplanades for several decades have not made it possible to find anything.
The mountain of the temple if it exists it is elsewhere.
Maybe in Argentinian?
This mountain is not wanted for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the mosques esplanade was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, protrudes in the middle of the mosque of Omar.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it was Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to recall it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the two-state plan, and scuttled it continuously!).
It is also good to show that the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Will God be able to recognize his own?
The shortest Jewish joke: "God be praised!"
To boast about tourism in Israel, we are often shown young, half-dressed naïds, long-lingered on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows us, as we can see in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a beautiful piece of propaganda!
It is a pity that the photographer of Reuters did not take pictures of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who prefer to stifle the Jewish faithful below, praying at the Wall of Lamentations.
@Mat, If this photo bothers you, it's right, it's not the newspaper, it's not the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she transmits that must be condemned.
This system is not tenable and will end in tears.
The only way to put an end to this system is through the revolution.
Since the economy seems to be turning around, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever greater remuneration to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of moaning and moaning when someone else strikes, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not just about their problems, but also about showing your employer that people are not being bothered with with impunity.
Unless we give up democracy, in which case it's tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
This can't end well.
It's because we're in a democracy that it worked.
Did you vote for the TTIP?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by bypassing national governments through secret courts.
It sounds incredible, but that's exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people to the unimaginable damage this agreement will have on our lives.
It's only recently that we're starting to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated behind your back.
Did Churchill not say "blood, sweat and tears"?
These are great spin-offs, while digital money has no reason to fall, let alone grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, in the 18th there were unions in all regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let her (finally, her officers, the others, nobody knows anything) believe herself to be the safe of the eternal values of France, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalisation, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even if for her, it's more and more uncomfortable...
You still miss the sindicat s of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I don't know what else.
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm a unionist.
You're warned, it'll be your fault.
For the defence of the interests of the categories, the protected professions with trade unions have already suffered far enough, which has created a breach of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of risk on the part of a public servant.
One can very well imagine a system which ensures a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise disaster insured.
And with the carts preparing, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject here commented...
Delete "through its delegates" from Article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker shall participate in the collective determination of working conditions and in the management of undertakings".
This is absolutely indispensable with the irruption of information power.
And yet you opened, probably read and then commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Bake Off review." ?????
Wait, the section was there, empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I looked at, and I can tell you that some of them were well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (though misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, pie mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a least worst baker's victory; no one has done like "boom, here's my fucking cake now eat it and bow to your master"!
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and relatives out there finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept away.
And there is also the idea of "playing safety, there's always next week" that disappears the last week.
I like to cook, but I can't imagine inflicting that on myself.
I am grateful to those who do it and thus offer us great entertainment and pushes us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and they had to tinker one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to decide, I don't know how they were able to choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the somewhat dry base (even though I agree with Hollywood that the green frosting on Richard's mill did not make him want, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I must admit that many of the challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time allotted.
There's also cancer watching, with the solar winds.
I'm sure it's all working out for us right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You're confusing solar wind with ultraviolet rays.
UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer, which is formed by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field were to weaken, there would not be enough solar wind to "pull" ozone out of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and "cancer".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don't suspect.
If we are limited to man they have the interest to allow us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks cancerous UVC and allows UVA and most UVBs to pass through.
You know that you don't have to be patronizing and consider your interlocutor as a dull person when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor clarification that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to demonstrate pedagogy.
Not to mention that I'm a regular melanoma user, UV is just ACCELING its development.
They don't PROVIDE him.
As proof: not all tanned people have melanomas.
So, when a doctor tells you to avoid the sun and live in a cellar, it's better not to listen because UV is necessary for every human.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we bend it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
Or switch it to the blender...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it and the robustness of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the purpose for which it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resistant and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as front-line communications equipment.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it
Except a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every conversation.
I've decided to count them.
This is the fourth fold joke I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone was removed from the main production line and we cannot see how it could return to it.
Therefore, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.................................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed correctly and is therefore stuck with the installed plant test code.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But, would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of a FCC or CE logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
Ah l article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industrialists produce in "industrial" We highlight super u but all the signs and even the small trade are concerned How to eat good, organic avac 1650€ (average salary in france)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After that, everyone is free to put their priorities where they want it.
For my part, food is one of them.
Go without a grudge, I kiss you
We call bobos, or better boboecolos, people who see the world through ideological "software" that leads them to disconnect from reality.
This is total unbundling thought-reason.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example claim to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartufery, joining the left-wing caviar, from which they have sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartufery, too, do not be surprised to often meet with criticisms about them.
Wow, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the associated details (airplane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I'm not.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecolos are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of left-caviar?
Well, you're able to understand the concept of boboécolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecologists at all.
Boboecolo is one of them, but it is only the most visible fringe of the ecologists because it is the one that infests the media.
Here's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look that giraffe in the face.
She's so badly done that she looks vaguely like a female nude.
Shh, you're right next to the plate.
You have to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to make a comment since you haven't spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not the fact that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic ability.
That's art.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin can't draw
This is not really a fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke while playing pool.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in that case.
Drawing is much more than just representing the real.
If you're looking for only that, a camera will do the trick.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still room for savings: the riding activities, the number of horses of the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
Honesty has to say that France is shrinking, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drasticly, starting with Great Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operative without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, at a time when we are looking at weaknesses and shortcomings in our defence tool, particularly in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities or even part of their history.
Where's the promised sanctuarization?
@edmond : that's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to save money but especially not at home, at home it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where the gabegy is certain.
Let all those who have met little or no military thing dare to come and say here, eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting of laughter...
Applying the same potion to the whole of the public service and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really reloud: look at the inflation of public jobs in other ministries and you will understand why Defence can think it's a bit loaded!
Well, yeah, the economies that everyone agrees they have to be made, they have to be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls moan at the murder when it happens at home, the poor darlings.
It should be done, but above all, that it doesn't fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for the local authorities, history was repeated at every post closure, maternity, hospital and barracks.
But everyone is for the economies of course.
It's weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and is not happy with the savings in public spending.
This article is really the most amazing thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It is the depressing to scroll his Facebook thread and see that 80% of his friends started their status with the phrase "This embarrassing moment".
I think they're gonna make a movie out of it.
He will surely base himself on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus on the way to work and realizes only there that his skirt has entered his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's totally stupid.
Not really, in my opinion, the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and tighten his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don't have "the internet."
So I don't think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
God, I have to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has really shown that he is at the top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I'm overturned!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the illumination and discover the incredible excitement and unsurpassable genius that springs from Mr Brooker's keyboard as a divine glow.
God, that was really lame.
Especially if they're not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development within democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until further notice, we are being confiscated the right to save our planet by states that play the tartuffs at every meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take matters into our own hands.
With the Commissioner they planted with energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away ....
Translate: Wind turbines and solar farms are the Roundabouts of tomorrow.
The whole thing is financed by the con-tribable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear discourse.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the industry is not controlled in its entirety, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided, of course, that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is in no way concerned.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions at production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity through wind renewables or PV is already more GHGs on the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittency.
Replacing nuclear power with wind renewables or PV would run counter to the fight against CO2.
Christial I am not insulting you I am a State Doctor in Physical Sciences 1981 and I did research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I said.
For what I didn't say it was you who gave me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany nothing in fact you didn't answer what I said and like all the people right-wing demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I would also like to quote the conclusion of experts commissioned by the German Government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an uneconomic and inefficient way of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you do not count uranium extraction and construction and if you do not count water vapour greenhouse gases of lesser effect than Co2 it is true recall two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant part in water vapour and a little in the water of rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a "South Asian giant"... !!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I'm not surprised, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it's a good indication of your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India the giant of South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would just open a Pandora's box full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, with Kolkata's Athletico winning 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India spends on IPL cricket and now on football, how could we ever compete with our "noise neighbors"...
The low-cost launcher race is paid for in cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect is only apparent with a helium that is too cold.
So we may not be in a design flaw, but in implementation...
Unlike Arianespace which is a private company, it seems that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they'll pay for the satellites in frigates who knows.
This is all the more unfortunate given that many media re-enact only the titles of articles - and that many readers only retain these titles .
In total, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Quite agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly impugned the project while it is only a launcher problem.
