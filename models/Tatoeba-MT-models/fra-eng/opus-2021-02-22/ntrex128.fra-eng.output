Members of the Wales Assembly concerned about "passing as puppets"
Welsh elected representatives are appalled by a proposal to replace their title with the name MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the proposed amendment to the name of the Assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of mockery.
One Labour member said that his group was concerned that the acronym "Rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Wales readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotte.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Wales Party) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (marionnette), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the letter u in English from the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the change of name, has indicated that "the final decision on the name of the members of the Assembly is the responsibility of the members of the Assembly".
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as a Welsh Parliament, which was widely supported.
On the question of the title of members, the Commission favours Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a large majority of Welsh preferred MWP.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach consensus could prove to be a real puzzle for Elin Jones, the Speaker of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a name change bill in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes concerning the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the name issue during the debate on the bill.
Macedonia: referendum on changing the name of the country
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be called the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbour, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted that the name Macedonia is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on the accession of its neighbouring country to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, said that he would ignore the results.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the change of name is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, bells of St. Martin silenced
"The older people I talked to say that traditionally there was a bar and a church on every corner," says Adams.
"There are none at all today."
According to him, it is normal that the bars have become scarce.
Today, "we don't get together in the same way anymore," he explains.
"We used to go to the bar like our neighbour's, but it's no longer the case."
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will run out well before what the officials imagine and it worries him: " sooner or later, they will return to square one".
He added that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who would not help maintain the last shrines in the neighborhood.
"The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will largely be whites who will precipitate the closure of all churches, as they are unlikely to become members of them," he says.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The original White Methodist congregation abandoned the premises in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation, preaching in the vicinity, took possession of the building.
The church of Saint Martin was taken over by a black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which blacks struggled to get employed or promoted.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new carillon,
that Father Johnson's son and successor in charge of St. Martin's Church, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the "bells of the poor."
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave it a completely different name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
She also mentions that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took his place in front of the larger carillon of Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather states that Saint Martin did not replace him.
Over the past few months, much has been said about the movement of architects and entrepreneurs, provoked by the secular elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay leaders, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter wanted to impose the expenses incurred on it, even though it had not participated in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: 13-year-old Teen Injured by Shark During Lobster Fishing Party · Global Voices
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old last Saturday while fishing lobster in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, the San Diego TV channel, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help and paddled up to him to get him out of the water.
At first Chad thought that the young boy was shouting for joy at having had a catch, and then he realized that in reality he
had been bitten.
Arriving near the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the collarbone.
"I was yelling for everyone to get out of the water: There's a shark!" explains Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The shark species at the origin of the attack is unknown.
At a press conference, First Aid Chief Larry Giles informed that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
The authorities closed access from Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation and security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered safe.
Sainsbury's Offensive Plans in the British Aesthetics Market
Sainsbury's handmade on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and garnishes them with shelves similar to those of supermarkets, filled with aesthetics and cosmetics and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK £2.8 billion aesthetics market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home goods are falling, more extensive beauty product shelves will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience proves conclusive.
Supermarkets are now investing in the beauty market to re-use the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's indicated that it would increase the volume of its offerings to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will include for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in areas similar to shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also reviving its Makeup Store line to offer a majority of products that are not tested on animals, an ever more important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, the perfume seller Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second opened later this year in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders need to grow their heads to attract consumers, who are increasingly tending to shop online and to go to local shops for daily food products.
Mike Coupe, general manager of Sainsbury's, said outlets will look more and more like supermarkets as the supermarket chain tries to counter discount Aldi and Lidl stores by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores since the purchase of the two chains two years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed to propel sales of everyday consumer goods and to profit from acquisitions.
Previous attempts to restructure the pharmaceutical and cosmetic shelves of the British chain had led to a failure.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but ended with controversy over the distribution of profits from supermarket pharmacies.
It was after selling its 281 pharmacies for £125 million to Celesio, the owner of the pharmaceutical chain Lloyds, three years ago that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role in introducing a wide range of high-end skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product shelves has been modified to improve the customer environment.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can provide sound advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any kind of need and, thanks to the beautification of our shelves and the ideal location of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now indisputable and changes purchasing habits," added Mills-Hicks.
Anger of Peter Jones after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a £11 million deal
Star of the TV show Dragon's Den, Peter Jones, after the announcement of the withdrawal of host Holly Willoughby from a £11 million contract related to her home decoration brand, to devote herself to her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to take care of the interior decoration brand and Truly accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
37 years old, the host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby made Dragon's Den star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their successful last-minute textile and interior decoration activity to focus on his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources reported that Jones was furious when the beloved child on TV revealed, at a meeting that took place under tension at the headquarters of Dragon's Den's star trading empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new £1.5 million contracts no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their decoration brand and interior accessories.
The Truly brand was assimilated to that of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the host's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped into his private jet to join one of his second homes outside of Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
and in the process of securing its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone speechless.
No one could imagine what would happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow's headquarters is filled with ready-to-sell products."
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most "bankable" celebrities, could result in the loss of millions to the company, due to significant investments in products ranging from cushions or candles, clothing or interior goods, and the risk of delayed launch.
Moreover, it could put an end to a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of that year.
Couples went on vacation together and Peter Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was heated, but finally we love each other.
Trump made fun of the media criticizing him because of his comment that some consider "unworthy of a president," and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give up so much?"
He mocked, taking a TV journalist's voice.
"I didn't give in at all."
He said that Kim Jong-un had been in favour of holding a second meeting, after Trump described the first meeting, which took place in Singapore in June, as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomacy leader Ri Yong Ho said Saturday to world leaders at the UN General Assembly that he saw no "corresponding response" from the United States to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
He regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his Trump rally speech offers a much more optimistic perspective.
"Everything is going well with North Korea," says the North American President.
We have come close to armed conflict.
"Millions of people are said to have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the remains of North American soldiers returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get to this full arena to crack, there's barely more than 200 standing in front of me," he criticized by pointing his finger at the crowd.
Tsunami: A devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, aid from foreign NGOs was supposedly not needed.
More than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok has been scattered, but no state of national disaster has been decreed as a condition for the triggering of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have repeatedly made it clear that they do not want international assistance, which makes things a little more difficult," said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to go to Palu, she still doesn't know if fieldwork will be allowed.
The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant tremors, the country is sorely lacking the means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Shelters have been established in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was given, no alarm siren sounded in Palu, which probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not simple.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the sites of the new disaster.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, has placed the reform of the dilapidated infrastructure at the centre of his electoral campaign and has spent considerable money on restoring roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has undermined Mr. Joko's government, which is called upon to stand in front of voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith more conservatively.
More than 1,000 Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven out of their homes, against the backdrop of clashes in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge achieves equalization against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool a Premier League defeat against Chelsea, scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's goals, and his team was led from 1-0.
He shot in the ball on his left, before escaping a shot to the second pole.
The balloon flew over the repair surface before heading towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reached Kepa Arrizabalaga and finished its journey at the bottom of the cage.
"I was just trying to position myself, grab the ball, but players like Shaq always shoot as far away as possible, so I tried to save as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante was approaching to control and without really much thought I decided to shoot."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker followed a pass to Mateo Kovacic, before heading towards the middle of the field and sprinting on the Liverpool side.
Kovacic made a quick back and forth in the middle of the field,
Then carried out a magnificent deep shot that led Hazard to the surface.
Hazard pushed the defense and finished his race in the net of the second pole, with a left foot shot behind Liverpool's doorman, Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Neapolitans in the Champions League group phase on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. this Thursday in London.
Indonesia: 832 Tsunami Victims · Global Voices
The Disaster Management Agency reported on Sunday morning that 832 people died as a result of the earthquake and tsunami.
Many residents are trapped under the rubble of the buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that shook the country on Friday and triggered waves 6 meters high, informed the spokesman of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency during a press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the town of Palu was dotted with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead (Merseyside) this morning.
At 07:55, the 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found on John Street in Grayson Mews, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police urge local residents who have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan made the following statements: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead and who would have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I appeal in particular to the taxi drivers, who could have picked something up on their dashcam and ask them to provide us with any information crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a property in Birkenhead where she resided.
This morning, people who said they knew the woman came to the crime scene and asked questions about where she was found.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have indicated that they are informing relatives close to the victim.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, as the police do not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him speechless.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer said that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared at the scene,
Repeating, "It's too horrible."

Anyone with information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crime Stoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, according to register 247 of September 30th.
Parliament: the statue of Cromwell, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its ban would be the fair return of things, in view of the destruction of countless religious and cultural property in England, committed by its Puritan supporters, such as the fanatic Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society found Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and described it as a "revisionist attempt."
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, states that "Given the current debate over the removal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell's statue in front of Westminster Palace would not be spared.
Cromwell did not order or lead the iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
The superb depiction of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to his 19th century consideration and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Goldsmith said at the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, I mean monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents one side of the fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated."
China: Pig Kills Breeder · Global Voices
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeastern China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery cut and covered with blood near a pig store on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, said Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesdays to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the nearby pigsty was open.
He says there was a huge male pig inside and blood flowing from his mouth.
A forensic report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg mutilated the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr.Wu, the farmer's cousin, said that "his legs were crushed and covered in blood."
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 04:40 on Thursdays to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig responsible for Mr. Yuan's death did not belong to the breeder or his cousin.
A market official told Evening News that the animal was locked up to avoid any further incidents and allow the police to gather evidence.
Mr. Yuan's family and market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, attacks by pigs on people have already been reported.
In 2016 on a Massachusetts farm, a pig assaulted a woman and her husband, seriously injuring him.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig caught a Welsh breeder on his tractor before his wife managed to get him away from it.
In 2012, when an Oregon breeder had just been devoured by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that it is not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behaviour.
"They're more of a game-playing animal,
Very curious kids... they have no intention of doing harm.
It is enough to show them the respect that is due to them," he assures.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeastern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northeast coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause showers in northeastern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
The winds had been at 135 km/h (Category 1 Hurricane) since 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and flows eastward to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a storm, Hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical humidity to the north in the southwest of the United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in regions of Mexico this Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create generalized torrential rains in the southwest over the coming days.
At the local level, precipitation between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous sudden floods, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
Rain showers will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour in locations, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical moisture.
It is expected to fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in areas of the southwest, including much of Arizona.
Dispersed tropical rains are likely to cause sudden flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rains could convert canyons into wild rivers and thunderstorms will produce wind gusts and dust whirlwinds in places.
The approaching depression will result in abundant local rains in some southern parts of the country on the Californian coast.
Rainfall totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could result in low debris flows and make the shoe slippery.
These could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Dispersed tropical showers will reach Arizona on Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, and will intensify later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will fall across the country on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Significant temperature variations are expected for October across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the tropical climate will remain warm,
This sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will suffer considerable temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to be warm in early October, with temperatures around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other areas of the northeast.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the season average.
Multi-day forecasts indicate that temperatures are expected to be above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Transmitted on 6 television channels on Thursday, the striking hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse continues, broadcasting services have interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a coup: an agreement designed by Jeff Flake, the Arizona Senator, to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
Before the Senate Judicial Commission, Christine Ford assured that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had been touching her and had tried to remove her clothes on a high school evening.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, said he was also 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial likely reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
Moreover, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
By way of comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts largely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most watched channel on audition day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC was second with an audience of 3.26 million.
Following were CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), again according to Nielsen.
Interest did not weaken once the hearing was over.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was being played on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator was caught up by protestors as he tried to take the elevator to the court hearing.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, while CNN relayed the live arrest sequence.
"Don't look elsewhere, look at me," says one of the women.
"Do you really think he's telling the truth?
You have power when so many women are deprived."
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake indicated that his office had issued a statement and that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All the cable and radio channels were covering the live session a few hours later, as the Judicial Commission was preparing to vote on the procedure for advancing the appointment of Kavanaugh by the Senate as a whole.
Flake, however, indicated that a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI into the accusations made against the candidate, which the minority democrats demanded.
Flake was partially persuaded by talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after meeting with Coons and several other senators later.
His choice weighed heavily on the balance, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without a preliminary investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate charges of sexual assault on Brett Kavanaugh.
Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of "little politics"
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of his plan to leave the European Union, to make "small politics" to the detriment of Britain's future and the national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May on the cover, its former foreign minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his so-called Chequers plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was "purely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect of the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old too, was imprisoned and charged with second degree murder, said Baton Rouge Police Service.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police reported that Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the crime scene, the glasses wore Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police that he was responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The office of the medical examiner of the parish of Baton-Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, which determined that the death was caused by a bullet wound that crossed the head and lodged in the neck.
The police service acknowledges the assistance received by the Fugitive Task Force of Louisiana State, the forensic laboratory of the state police, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for their "commitment and their quest for justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, the LSU basketball coach said the team was "damaged and shocked" after Wayde's death.
"We fear this kind of event all the time," Wade regretted.
Mexico City: Volcano Spills Ash · Global Voices
Ash escaping from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre recommended that Mexicans move away from the volcano, after recording a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre monitored several rumblings and tremors from the Popocatepetl.
On social media, images showed thin layers of ash covering car windshields in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano located 72 km from the capital, since an earthquake of a magnitude of 7.1 shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, nicknamed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists in the run-up to the anniversary of the vote for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independence protesters and the riot police, while thousands of opponents joined in protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being turned back by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and coloured powder at them, creating clouds of dust in the streets, which usually do not deplete tourists.
Warming also broke out later in the day, while the police used truncheons to contain the clashes.
For several hours, groups in favor of independence chanted "no oblivion, no forgiveness", faced unionist supporters shouting "long life to Spain".
14 demonstrators with minor injuries were treated, according to the local press.
One year after the referendum on 1 October, which was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the Catalans in favour of separation, tensions remain high in the independence region.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low turnout, as opponents of secession largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independence groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration in support of the national police.
It nevertheless took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia's independence.
"We witnessed a great moment last year.
My parents were crying with joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in an impasse," he deplores.
Despite their capital, though slim, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties struggled to maintain the momentum this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained pending trial for organizing the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, filming the police support demonstration on her phone, believes that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on both sides.
"Tension is only rising," he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison waiting for a judgment since last year, announced his intention to present his candidature for the European Parliament elections next year.
"This is the best way for me to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government," he adds.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men hit a house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly driving on a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Police Captain Bob Blommings indicated that the doors and walls were damaged.
The car was also reportedly shot with arrows.
Livingston wins game 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal secures Livingston's victory
Recently raised in rank, Livingston's team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 games on Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place second in the standings, tied with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of outside victory in the Premiership League this season, and face the Hearts team, which leads by 8 points on Sunday.
But first, the Rangers will meet the Vienna Rapid on the occasion of the Europa League this Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, she extends her undefeated career in the division by 6 games, and her head coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, may boast that she hasn't lost a single match yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity in the face of dull opponents
Holt's team could have taken a lead long before scoring, as their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to break through but remained stuck in front of the opposing goal; followed a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on Craig Halkett's lead pass.
The Livingston team allowed the Rangers to own the ball, knowing it could interfere with them by working tactics.
That is where the decisive goal came in.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and the Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to catch Menga, who took a touch and scored a midfielder goal.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but were faced with an impenetrable defense and goaltender Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half had the same rhythm, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop.
Ranger goaltender Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's strike from his feet, while Lithgow managed to thwart one of the Livingston plans.
The goalkeeper of Livingston rejected all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the referee, one for the provocation of Halkett against Glenn Middleton and the other for a fault of hand.
The Livingston "Prophecy" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of the BBC Scotland, to Tony Macaroni Arena
Amazing performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to surpass expectations on this ascending slope.
Their style and the composition of the team have hardly changed since their return to the top, but the credit goes largely to Holt for having since his arrival motivated a team
which has many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grand and magnificently organized, and Menga was able to hold Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on hold throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerrard, they did not live up to their past talent.
They missed one last opportunity and only managed to break through the opposing side once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Mixed welcome of President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Various issues were discussed, such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the largest Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Citing security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 demonstrators from rallying in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, have made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to his country.
The cleavage that emerges from the protests reflects Erdogan's double vision: a visitor greeted as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and described by others as autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after car crash
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, rescue arrived on site, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday. The driver had fled.
The London police said that the officers were doing everything possible to identify the individual and warn his or her relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus diversions have been put in place. Motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 officers injured in riot
The head of the high-security prison stated that six prison officers had been injured in a riot.
The riot started in HMP Long Lartin prison, located in Worcestershire, around 9:30 a.m. local time this Sunday. It is still not under control.
Special anti-riot officers were sent to unblock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a wing of the prison.
On site, the officers were treated for slight facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison management said: "Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons. Those responsible will have to answer the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences extended."
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered to be the most dangerous in the country, are incarcerated in HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October, last year, riot control officers were sent to the prison to stop a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked the staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden floods (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading towards the southwest desert with what is left of her energy. This region could be hit by sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, with early rains starting on Monday night.
Phoenix-based national weather service tweeted that "only ten tropical cyclones have kept the stage of depression or tropical storm in a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center predict 5-10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm in locations in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin are expected to record 2.5-5 cm of precipitation, with total measurements up to 10 cm isolated.
Rosa's rains could be lifesaving for drought-affected areas that are not exposed to the risk of sudden flooding.
Even if the risk of flooding is not to be taken lightly, the rain could be beneficial for the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, just over 40% of Arizona has at least one extreme category drought, the second most severe category," reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa begins her way on the coast, on the peninsula of Baja California.
Still of high power Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and travels north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the strength of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday night.
In some parts of Mexico, precipitation could be massive and lead to a risk of flooding.
"In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation are expected from Baja California northwest of the Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm," said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico northward, with the strength of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border on Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and southern Utah in the evening of Tuesday.
"Tritain rains are expected in Baja California, northwest of Sonora and in the southwest desert and are the main danger," said the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in sudden, life-threatening floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted homicide, after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 4am local time.
He was sent to the hospital, and his condition is currently stable.
Police in Avon and Sommerset reported that they arrested the four young men (aged 17, 18 and 20) during the night on the side of Radstock.
The agents made a call to people who might have filmed the scene with their phones.
Trump declares that Kavanaugh was the victim of the wickedness and anger of the democrats
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been the victim of the wickedness and anger of the Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke to Congress on Thursday, rejecting with energy and emotion the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses her of sexually assaulting her several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage" this day.
"A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service," he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The President made indirect reference to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I fight on all fronts for great candidates."
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
The first decisive procedural vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place by Friday, according to the statement of a Republican party collaborator at CNN.
Indonesia: Hundreds of people die as a result of earthquake and tsunami
On Saturday, the authorities said that at least 384 people had died, most of them swept away by huge waves that fell on the beaches while an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebians.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves six meters high submerged the beach at nightfall. They took many lives and destroyed everything in their way.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake preceded the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People didn't flee immediately, it cost them their lives," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Disaster Management Agency (NPDB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't happen alone. It dragged cars, pieces of wood, houses, it took everything with it," Nugroho said, noting that the tsunami had moved in the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by climbing trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial images published by the Disaster Management Agency show destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the Friday earthquake was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb released on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geographic location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have increased the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found trapped under the rubble of ruined buildings, he added, noting that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that human and material losses could be greater on the 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closest to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely paralyzed" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," said The Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were moving towards the affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could get worse," she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not disseminating information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although agents said that the waves had arrived while the alert was being issued.
An amateur video shared on social networks shows a man on the floor of a building frantically shouting to street passers-by as a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a water wall fell on the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to authenticate the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that shut down all communications in Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army began to transport aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport reopened as part of relief operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia: Tsunami casualties are on the rise, with more than 800 deaths.
It's a tragedy.
World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu, where they found shelter in tarpaulin shelters in the courtyard of their offices. On the way, they discovered scenes of devastation, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to assist the victims, some complained that experienced foreign aid workers had not been allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
"This disaster is still considered regional," explains Aulia Arriani, spokesman for The Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares this to be a national disaster, international assistance can intervene, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday fell on Palu, the relatives of the missing persons were still hoping for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
Sunday, the rescuers released a woman buried under the rubble for two days, near her mother's body.
Indonesian National Paragliding Team coach Gendon Subandono had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Others of his students were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr Mandagi added.
"As an elder in paragliding discipline, I have experienced my own dramas," he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paragliding community, Mr. Gendon reported that he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His messages remained unanswered.
"I don't think they've ever received my messages."
In Newport on the Levee, thieves steal $26,750 when recharging a vending machine
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was charging a vending machine at Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Service press release.
The driver of the vehicle emptied a distributor into the entertainment complex and prepared to feed it, says Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the vending machine.
Witnesses reportedly saw many suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not indicate the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities is requested to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West : the rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Formerly known as Kanye West."
41-year-old West, who has been called Ye for some time, used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going to Saturday Night Live, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled his arrival for "emotional reasons", explained the creator of the show.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current pseudo-professional, this nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
"I think "Ye" is the word most used in the Bible, where it means "you," West explained earlier this year, evoking the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us.
I went from Kanye, which means "the only one," to Ye - the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who worked with West in the past, also played on the hyphen and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO states that it will never use military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians, almost fifty years after bloody reprisals by law enforcement forces against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to "never use military force to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire during a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly grants to students and by opening more public universities free of charge.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people to join criminal gangs.
The US is expected to double funding in the area of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States is expected to double its funding for research in this sector, according to AI expert and investor Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several U.S. government actors have made AI announcements, while a formal AI strategy is lacking in the United States.
At the same time, China presented its road map last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling funds for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are one step ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next big AI discovery," Lee says.
Double funding could double the chances that the next key step in AI will come from the United States," Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player. He then joined Microsoft Research’s management team and became president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee has already participated in technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government.
"It's not China that owns the university leaders, it's companies," Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited leading academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that changes in immigration policies could also support U.S. AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically given to AI researchers," he says.
China's State Council unveiled its new generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions, as do the National Science Foundation and other government organizations that distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to involve industry and academy partners. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation working to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia made their voices heard in a referendum on the change of name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia. This change would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of whose provinces is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right in its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would affect the ethical identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum participation of 50% required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?"
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to pay to join organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which has survived the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the aegis of the European Union, which means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said that they will follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which mobilized 66% of the registered voters after the vote.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the change of name, in order to open the vote for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents installed by those boycotting the referendum.
"We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments. The unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
"I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Mr Zaev after tabling his ballot.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a poll published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters intend to participate in the referendum, which is below the expected turnout.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian channel Telma, estimated the participation at 57 per cent.
70% of participants intending to vote said they would vote "yes."
For the referendum to be valid, 50% of the votes plus one vote are required.
The failure of the referendum would be the first blow to the policy of the pro-west government since it took power in May last year.
Decisive action: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City makes his way through Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defencemen in Manchester and won the 2-0 game on Saturday at Manchester's Etihad Stadium.
Aguero's goal, in the 65th minute, seemed to be the easiest action in the world for the player.
The Argentinian scorer received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before diving into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He bypassed a defender before ousting the others near Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English forward took the opportunity to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to trick Brighton's goaltender, Mathew Ryan, with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," explained Pep Guardiola, the team coach, to the journalists.
"We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Skyblues the initial advantage in the Premier League game,
From the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on the Brighton field.
He sent it on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before taking Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the ball into the nets just before slipping out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the rockies.
As the Nationals team was eliminated from the play-off race, there was no reason to start a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in case of a playoff game for the Rockies, real legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies won 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to secure their first division title.
"Even though this game has no stakes, we want to tread the field in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and against a team that will probably play at the highest level I will have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce a launcher leaving for Sunday, but would be inclined to leave room for Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, will be in training Thursday and will launch on his usual day of rest, Sunday.
The right-handed Washington is at 18-7 with an average of 2.53 points earned and 300 withdrawals on 220-step and two-thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The President alluded to the situation that his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court had generated when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's a major issue. I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever. That's why I fight on all fronts for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, really horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
The Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"You can see this over the last four days," he added, before describing the Democrats as "angrily, wicked and lying."
He referred to the Judicial Committee of the United States Senate and Senator Democrat Dianne Feinstein, which earned him public booing.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer the big community it used to be.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas
When activists from my local party's Momentum movement voted to censor me, it wasn't a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour Party parliamentarians who are not welcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she rose up against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are issues on which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday said, "We want the rally to be inclusive and productive."
This is exactly what the Friday night general assemblies were like during my eight years as a Labour Party parliamentarian.
Unfortunately, today there are not many gatherings and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has been forgotten for a long time, if it has ever been taken into consideration.
It has become clear that contrary opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged according to its acceptability by the party leaders.
It started shortly after Jeremy took power, and the colleagues with whom I thought I shared the same political vision began to expect me to turn over my jacket and take positions that were contrary to my convictions, whether it was about national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, followed an abusive tirade on social networks, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
Moreover, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me were of a political nature.
I am in admiration for the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who are confronted with sexist or racist statements every day, but who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing things in current policy is the normalization of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is narrowing down through the motions of disbelief and changes to the rules of selection.
I've been given a lot of advice over the past two years: look down, not express my ideas so loud, and everything would be fine.
But it is not to act like this that I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because the negligence of Thatcher's government had caused my classroom to collapse. Since then, I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and my differences with the current party leaders.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country is moving towards a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services. I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes I defend, which are your common interests.
Chris Leslie is a member of Parliament for the riding of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr remains undefeated
Two late tries may have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense day game of the Scotland Rugby Championship at XV.
The team now occupies the top of the standings and becomes the only undefeated team in the championship.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defense and the way they seized the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can be pleased with this match.
"So far, we've been tested, but we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy!" he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, congratulated Ayr: "Congratulations to them, they were more effective than us and were able to seize the opportunities."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute essay, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for the Scottish Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers talk. Jason Baggot took over an untransformed essay.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just at half time. He scored and transformed a solo attempt to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There followed a long wait due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher. During the recovery, Ayr returned to the front with a try of Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, acting captain of Ayr, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an untransformed Bruce Colvine test, which created a palpable tension.
But the home team got back in hand and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for beating Climo while he didn't have the ball, from the touch of the penalty, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's maul, which was progressing.
Climo transformed the test, as almost every time since the recovery, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent winger Gregor Henry away for the team's fifth try at home.
Still Game star embarks on restoration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to pursue a career in catering. The actor was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-hosts with his long-time partner on stage, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series that is coming will be the final of the show. And Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source from the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "pronounced restoration environment" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol an armoured boat at La Paz Naval Headquarters.
Public buildings have a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following motorcycle: "The sea is ours.
Recovering it is a duty."
Throughout blocked Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile during a conflict of blood resources in the nineteenth century is still present. Just as the desire to sail over the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for several decades: Bolivia is indeed awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be delivered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive result," explains Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ruling of the International Court of Justice on a large screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia's request. Bolivia hopes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be obliged to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the ocean to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who is facing a controversial fight for the re-election next year), also has a lot to say about the decision to be rendered on Monday.
"We are so close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will rule in favour of Chile, and that little would change, even in the event of a positive decision.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice renders its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case “was not complicated”, explains Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the past four years have perhaps even harmed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined all the Chilean goodwill that remained, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange views, but after that it will be very difficult to hold talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was abnormally rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - who so far remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political crutches.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must get rid of the past."
North Korea affirms that nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's Foreign Minister, said his country would not release its nuclear weapons until it trusted Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at a Singapore summit between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems on the verge of reviving nuclear diplomacy in the impasse more than three months after the Singapore Summit with Kim Jong Un, the current North Korean leader.
Ri states that it is "chimerical" to think that the continuation of sanctions and the United States' opposition to a declaration that will put an end to the Korean war will bend the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of any significant prior disarmament measures on the part of Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang's seriousness about renunciation of an arsenal that the country considers to be the only guarantee of its security is being debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month, in order to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in head covers, perhaps soon available in your shops
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from 100% sun, don't look anymore.
Creators Valentino and Thom Browne presented their crazy oversize hat collections at a PE19 show that honoured the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Hats all more extravagant than each other invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their delusional pieces into the parades.
Valentino's flagship piece was a beige eccentric hat adorned with a wide edge evoking a feather, which swallowed the head of the mannequins.
The other oversized accessories included watermelons adorned with jewelry, a sorcerer's hat and even a pineapple. But these pieces were not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most masks had sewn lips and evoked more Hannibal Lecter than Upper Cuture.
One design looked like diving equipment, with tuba and glasses, while another looked like a molten ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you're lucky.
According to the style observers, the imposing hats could come to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow the wake of the "Bomba", the straw hat on a wide edge that the stars take away, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this difficult portable hat that flooded social networks presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit model who wore it.
The burnt orange rafia bag, decorated with rafia fringes and a handful of white leather, was the centerpiece of the PE19 La Riviera de Jacquemus show during the Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big beach hats and bags arrive in the shops for next summer. The designer has so impressed the minds that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence.This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent exam results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen career and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a tailor-made curriculum, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak at his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, you speak to his heart."
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and build trust with people in other countries.
Looking at the excellent exam results this year, we see that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest score, A.
The data collected from the 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of pupils obtained the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as did the 72% of pupils who studied German, the 69% of pupils who studied French and the 63% of pupils who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
From now on, languages as subjects are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 UK Commission for Employment and Skills survey shows that 17% of employers' difficulties in recruiting candidates are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital for preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of career choice, a person who speaks a second language will have a real advantage in the future through this enduring skill.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4000 adults living in the UK, 75% of them did not have sufficient command of a foreign language to conduct a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15%).
That is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding rewarding employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on contemporary classical languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the UK in the run-up to 2020, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with a specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds for them.
It is clear that, in a global business environment, languages remain of paramount importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut with the Lakers on Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans watching for LeBron James' debut at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday in the pre-season opening against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he'll play yet.
"More than one, less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training, earlier this week James was asked about his plans for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
"At this point in my career, I don't need pre-season games to be ready."
Trump's campaign in West Virginia ( YouTube link)
President Donald Trump begins tonight a series of campaign meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stopovers, including in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
As the vote to confirm the vacancy in the Supreme Court is postponed, Trump seeks support for the upcoming mid-term elections and avoids the Republicans losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time does Trump's meeting in West Virginia take place tonight and how do we watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m.(Eastern Time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the issue of the hearings of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be postponed until one week during the FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of this series of meetings is to help Republicans gain ground in preparation for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American president stated in his campaign that the purpose of the five meetings was to "encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and extend the majorities they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
"Congress control is such an essential part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the start of a busy election campaign," a Trump team spokesman told Reuters, who refused to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's meeting, scheduled at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, could bring together supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media."
Saturday will be Trump's second one-month visit to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come in to try to revive him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: United States team ready to fight to keep hope close to Sunday's singles
After three simples, Saturday afternoon's foursomes might well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The momentum balance movement is a sports concept invented from scratch but to which players sincerely believe, and more than ever in tournaments such as this.
Where would they place the momentum now?
"They were leading with six points ahead and now four, so it gives us a bit of wings," said Jordan Spieth as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel a bit of the wind and have every reason to be encouraged, notably by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day long and can boast that they each scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been extremely effective from tee to green and sets an example.
The energetic shouts of joy intensified as his game progressed. A crucial putt allowed him to equalize in the fourth part while Thomas and he were led two down after two holes.
His putt, through which they won the game in the 15th hole, sparked a similar cry, from those who tell you that he believes the American team is still running.
"You really need to stay determined and focus on your game," said Spieth.
That's all that's left to each of these players now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the Ryder Cup history shows.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four games out of four and is not entitled to mistake.
Not only were "Moliwood" the only ones not to make a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the delirious crowd, designates them as the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to whom to delight a potential European victory as the sun sets on the National Golf.
Preferably, both at the same time at different holes.
But speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, hero of the morning's fourballs, as he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they could never come out of.
On the other hand, Sundays no one is here to help you.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between pairs, the advice they give and those they don't give, and how a strategy can tip in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a considerable lead over the last day, but this foursome session has also proved that the Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially in the country.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enjoy a solid advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning it 10-6 over the United States in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a Tiger Woods in distress, allowing them to score four points so far.
Determined to keep the title she lost at Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made a difference by winning 3-1 in the morning fourballs against a disorderly American team.
The United States showed greater resistance in the foursomes and won two victories, but failed to close the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must get eight points out of 12 Sunday's singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to score four in a row, while Molinari and he, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a smashing weekend, were only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they beat the pair of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired by an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who hung out during Saturday's two games, shone a few times, but now has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning fourballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning 2 to 1 over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively number one and three in the world rankings.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the southwest of Paris, under cool but clear weather.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 win over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, who lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, one team recovered from a four-point singles gap, although Furyk's team, which held the crown, had to draw to keep their trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they may not recover from a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea declares that disarmament can in no way be achieved unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the maintenance of sanctions reinforced his distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
At the annual General Assembly of the global organization, Ri Yong Ho stated that North Korea had taken “important measures of goodwill” last year, such as putting an end to such things as the cessation of nuclear testing and missiles, the dismantling of the nuclear test site and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we see no corresponding response from the United States," he regretted.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, in such circumstances, we cannot be the first to disarm unilaterally."
While reiterating North Korea's well-known criticism of Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps gradually, its statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on 12 June in Singapore at the very first summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work for a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first renounce its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused requests to relax severe international sanctions against North Korea.
the United States insists that North Korea first proceed to denuclearization and increase the pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve their objective in a coercive way, even opposing the "declaration of an end to war"."
"Those who think these sanctions can make us bend don't know us.
The problem is that the maintenance of sanctions increases our mistrust."
Ri made no comments on the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader highlighted in front of the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the party concerned by the issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such an impasse."
Despite this, Ri's tone of speech was radically different from last year's, when he said before the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles at North America after President Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened last year before the United Nations to "totally destroy" North Korea, has not paid tribute this year to the courage with which Kim has implemented disarmament measures, but added that much remains to be done and that the sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said no deadline had been set."It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn't matter," he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council last Thursday: "The application of Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until complete, definitive and verified denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to stifle the financing of Pyongyang nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already travelled to North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang claiming that progress had been made, but in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced its "gangster methods."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
He has, according to South Korean President Kim, called for the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore, and for efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students Take Rest Courses
This year, Harvard University introduced a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and fights against the growing macho trend of studying by consuming caffeine all night long.
One professor noticed that most students at the best university in the world do not know how to take care of them
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is, according to him, the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him.
In the end, a student approached me and said, "Why is this only said to me in the last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
Delivered for the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their academic and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of Health Services at the University, stated that the University had decided to introduce the course after finding that the students were suffering from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course time consists of various interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee boxes, curtains, sneakers, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not instantly change student behaviour.
However, in our view, they have the right to know this information - in the same way that you have the right to know what the health effects of smoking are," added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride in "spending a sleepless night" still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students make lack of sleep a growing problem.
Having sufficient and good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain into mode of inanition, making them permanently hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He stated that the course opened his eyes and urged him to insist that it be offered throughout the campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to offer all postgraduate students a similar program of study before joining the renowned institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students provide an alarm for both the time of bedtime and the time of awakening, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and lead to sleep disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga’s goal brings Gerrard’s men down
The Rangers were hit again outside, with Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to Livingston to a 1-0 loss.
Ibrox's team hoped to record its first win on the move since its 4-1 triumphant in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted on Gerrard his second loss in 18 games as coach, leaving his team adrift, eight points behind the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, just behind Hibernian on the goal difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, as umpire Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury from the jet of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which swept Ayr into the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, for his part, chose the same Livi 11 that ripped a point from the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see that his well-trained team was suffocating his opponents every turn.
The Rangers may have controlled possession of the ball, but Livingston has done more.
They should have scored at two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then fired a powerful shot at Captain Craig Halkett, but his defending teammate Alan Lithgow could only reach the second pole
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have benefited from a penalty after the free-kick when he and Steven Lawless collided, but umpire Steven Thomson ruled out the Colombian's demands.
The Rangers took advantage of only two shots in the first period, but Ibrox's former goaltender, Liam Kelly, was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and a strike by Ovie Ejaria.
If the opening of the score by Livi in the 34th minute was against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it because of their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs' stopped kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed over the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure to choose Menga for an end all in simplicity.
Gerrard reacted to the half by replacing Coulibaly by Ryan Kent and the exchange almost had an immediate impact when the winger showed up in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston still continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the last few moments, but McGregor managed well to push Jacobs back before Lithgow missed the goal.
The Ranger replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was struggling with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanach : The inventor of the Geiger meter
And now, a page from our Almanach "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE ACCOUNTER TOURNE...was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that later gave rise to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two improbable scientists:
A man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, it's used to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
Thanks to these headphones, we can really hear the effects of atoms released into the minerals by radioactivity."
Evans: "Say, it's sure to jump!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells and kill them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in a laboratory
They can then "detect" a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists in extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory, so that they can detect the HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein "produces an increase in several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, which involves taking immune cells to "learn" them to target cancer cells, has proven successful in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
With a MAGA cap, Kanye West embarked on a Pro-Trump diatribe after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed on the stage after a wild performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump at a Saturday Night Live and announced that he would run for election in 2020.
After his third song, Ghost Town, which he sang wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I talk to white people and they say, "How can you love Trump? He's racist!"
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL program started with a Matt Damon sketch in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee regarding the allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the recording of West's diatribe was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock was going to make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad 15 minutes behind the scenes because of his hat.
"They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that hat on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I'm in a chasm," he says, according to the Washington Examine.
West continued: "Do you want to see him, the chasm?" and said he would wear his cape as a superman, because no one can dictate his actions. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love."
His comments attracted booes at least twice from the public and the members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, reports Variety. One person on site told the magazine: "A silence of death fell on the whole set."
West had been called to replace last minute singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West disarranged a lot of people by singing the song I Love it in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR HOLDING YOUR HEAD IN FOULE."
But Karen Hunter, the host of the show, tweeted that West was simply "faithful to himself, and that it's absolutely wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying their music, their clothes, or by supporting their art) who, in my opinion, adopts and pours out an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and stated that he was now "officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg bore the name of Snoop Lion and of course the legendary late Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, then that of the artist previously known as Prince.
Belfast: Charge of attempted murder after stabbing in restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to the police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear on Monday before the Belfast Court of First Instance.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, star of the Game of Thrones series, tackles toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his fine blade role, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's violent medieval fantastic series.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, asserting that this type of role on screen often leads young boys to pretend to be hard-boiled to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he said "something is wrong" and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of the #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a covedette of the 31-year-old Game of Thrones, admitted that he was "strongly" committed to addressing this issue.
"Personally, I deeply believe that we have abused masculinity."
"What teachings have we given to young men who become adults, in relation to the problem that now arises?"
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity because of its very male characters.
He continued: "What behavior is innate, what behavior has been inculcated?
What do television and the street teach young boys who encourage them to think that they have to behave like this to be a man?
I believe that this is really one of the fundamental questions of our time - how can we change this?
There is obviously something wrong."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make prologues or sequels when the series ends next summer, saying he was done with "the battlefields and the horses."
Starting in November, Kit will be the star of a cover of True West by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting his wife Rose was for him the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life from now on," he says.
Rose performed Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, at Leslie's family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most patients have been infected during sexual intercourse, which is a new development.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly in some parts of the country as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
In China's LGBT community, the transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70 to 90 per cent of homosexual men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee disclosed data about senators, and denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
On Saturday, US Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team had published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia's legislator pages.
Los Angeles Democracy said these statements were supported by experts and "extreme right" websites.
"Lies, lies, and more infamous lies," Waters responded in a statement on Twitter.
It would appear that the information disclosed included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed the information of a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, "this unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information."
"This false allegation is completely false and a true lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press officer.
"This denial is anger," he wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he or she has not done, he or she must not be angry.
It must not be provocative.
It must not call into question the reasons of the accuser.
She must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters in the mid-term elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In its statement, Waters stated that its office had alerted "the relevant law enforcement authorities and services" about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the culprits are exposed," she added, "and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English hit again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, under-behaved spy
It has now become a tradition to look for Brexit's reach in any new British film and this seems to apply to this reprise of the action comedy Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will ironic self-satisfying on the question of the obviousness of our insignificance represent our country's new export opportunity?
In all cases, the incompetent Johnny English, with his face in rubber, saw his licence renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicating above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking cinematic audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts at glamorous charmer, possesses a little Clouseau, a hint of Mr Bean and a good dose of the guy who performs a small note in The Fire Chariots at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, he was also inspired by the traveler and man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard TV commercials, now forgotten, leaving chaos behind.
The last Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter as he wore a medieval armor and the rotor blades hit his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humour is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses such as 007 and Mission impossible make up themselves confidently with comedy.
The humour seems to be more child-oriented than adult-oriented and, for me, Johnny English's far-fetched misadventures are less creative and less focused than Atkinson's silent film gags in Bean's character.
The perpetual premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great dismay of operatives in service - a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vase overflow for a prime minister who is a pompous character at the edge of the crisis and who already suffers from a political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this character quasi-Teresa-May, but there is not much to put under the tooth in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that every active spy has been compromised, so she will have to get someone out of her retirement.
This means to disturb Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic institution as a schoolmaster, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: some nice jokes here, because English offers an academy of espionage like Rock Academy.
English was taken back to Whitehall for an emergency information meeting and found Bough, his former long-term partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who are causing great trouble to His Majesty's secret services, take action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the influence of the charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of wild jokes: under the disguise of waiters, they set fire to a brilliant French restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking into the luxurious Volta sailboat; and English triggers a veritable anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality helmet, to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are insured for this last sequence, but despite everything, there are a lot of things for the kids in all this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn't help but think, as for Johnny English's other films: can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party denied that it had drawn up a plan for the British to work four days but that they would be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must examine a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while continuing to receive the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic agenda and plans to guide the country to the benefit of workers.
The shift to a four-day week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source in the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year."
"This will not be done in one night, but a four-day work week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers as well as with its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party committed to a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not yet supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not a party policy and is not envisaged by the party."
Alternate Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to give details of his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell expressed his determination to take over the power of "anonymous administrators" and "profiters" in public utility enterprises.
The plans of the alternate chancellor also provide that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover all of their stakes since the Labour government could make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
It also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into corporate boards of directors and the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, who will collect up to £500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was postponed for at least one week following the FBI's investigation of the charges against him and raised the question of whether the Bureau's findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the 60 Minutes correspondent, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Obviously," said Kennedy.
"On my way to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal."
However, Graham's vote seems to be engraved in stone.
"I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people she appoints could not verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I see nothing new that changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive star list and an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people rushing to the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only benefit from the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the festival's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, first held in 2012, is a Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, e-mail a world leader, phone or make any other useful effort to raise public awareness of the fight against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen still achieve its goal in the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really persuade them to demand a call for action, or is it just another example of "clickivism" - a situation in which people really think they make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped drive world leaders to make commitments and adopt policies amounting to more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, of which a tranche of at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or lifted.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executors who have committed to "helping children develop their full potential," while promising Rwanda £35 million Sterling to help end malnutrition in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following the undertaking of more than 5,000 actions to ask the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, "what makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "The way to do this will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
The United States could appeal to the Navy to create a "blockage" to hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" appeal to the US Navy, revealed Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's presence in Syria - especially where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe they are in the Middle East with the aim of negotiating energy as they are in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this.
"The United States can, along with our Navy, ensure that shipping routes are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he added.
Zinke was speaking to participants at the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the "energy consumer spokesperson" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are in fact identical.
"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia saying that it has "more than one rope to its bow" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is committed to boosting the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the "inappropriate" project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which Trump says is making Berlin "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the $11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is simply economic and is an example of unfair competition.
In a September speech in Moscow following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said "I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The position of the United States has received negative reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to be involved in European energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of running for the 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider the possibility of running for the presidential election following the mid-term election.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top," she says, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public rally, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction."
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in a Twitter message, Warren said, "Obviously we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that Warren's majority of voters are not of the opinion that she should run in 2020.
According to the poll conducted by the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk and the Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not run.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more strongly supported, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other prominent democrats mentioned for a potential campaign in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden stated that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin evokes Track Palin's PTSD during Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged in connection with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is experiencing right now, how he feels when he comes home, I can connect him to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are getting back with," she told the public at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "a taboo subject" and said about his son and other veterans that "they are coming back a little different, hardened, wondering if we respect what their comrades and air force members, and every other soldier, have given to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Service, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a relationship of domestic violence and possession of an intoxicated weapon.
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, D.C., representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a brief in favour of an asylum seeker who was challenging this policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the complainant in Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against Federal Policy was not disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and her sons, members of violent gangs," had assaulted her, but the US authorities decided to reject her asylum application on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new US asylum policy overturned a decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board in 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District Attorney General of Columbia, Karl Racine, said Friday in a statement that the new policy "is unaware of decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law stipulates that all applications for asylum must be examined according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," the amicus curiae stated in its brief.
Counsel also argued in the submission that the immigration denial policy is detrimental to the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is granted to persons who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on the grounds of race, belief, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political convictions," said Sessions, on 11 June, in its announcement of the said policy.
"The asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the -- even the most serious -- problems people face every day around the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
"I feel very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her feverish little boy in Palu, in a emptied city evacuation centre.
"At every moment, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents were seen going to their destroyed homes, picking up wet goods and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were submerged.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a back and shoulder fracture, rested in front of the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to persistent strong replicas.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he had felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but after the silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda advertisements"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page advertisement boasting of the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China in an American newspaper, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register – the best-selling newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US parliamentary elections on November 6, an accusation that China refutes.
By accusing Beijing of wanting to interfere in the US elections, Trump marked what US officials told Reuters to be a new phase in a growing campaign led by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralysed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters from states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an opinion article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting a paid advertisement into the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"On the other hand, at the Beijing press counter, you will find few dissenting voices and will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on China's disturbing economic trajectory, because the media are firmly obeying the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China avoided publishing" his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans alienate women voters in the run-up to mid-term elections due to Kavanaugh's debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that a negative reaction, particularly among women, could occur during the upcoming mid-term election.
The feelings surrounding this matter have been extremely strong, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, stated that "we can't go back."
Reeher added that he doubted that the last-minute efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favour of an FBI investigation were enough to calm the voters' anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Advisor and National Spokesperson for the Progressive MoveOn group, "women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," she said on September 28th, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, the protesters sang "November is coming!" in the Senate corridor while the Republicans governing the Judicial Committee chose to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democracy enthusiasm and motivation will be disproportionate," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and among young voters aged 18 to 29 who, even if they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement detailing the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that the reaction might be strong if Republicans advanced the confirmation.
According to NBC News, former president of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said earlier last week that "It has become a confused mess for the GOP."
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, it's about Kavanaugh's appointment, it's about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities for the United States, a group that helps elected democrats in the news.
Following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, the Americans appear to be divided about the credibility of both sides, a small majority leaning on their side.
A new YouGov survey found that 41% of those consulted believed Ford's testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% believed that Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied in the course of his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford and at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judicial Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while intoxicated at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying in Yale in the 1980s, the candidate for the Supreme Court would have shown him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's Solid Free Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is backed up as well as who is allowed access to such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt aimed to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," he said about the launch.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "online personal data store" or DPL.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The particularity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this "personal responsibility via data".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is for the company to provide appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few developers working under contract on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team are not yet in discussion with "Facebook and Google" to find out whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely upset in an instant.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a Saturday article on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that "the mission [of Inrupt] is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a First World War cleric decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this award on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was unaware that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons unveiled a commemorative stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's exploit.
According to the London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and violent firing of field guns and machine guns."
Later he rushed to the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery," guided the line before blowing up a field cannon on his own and knocking down three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant-Colonel Vann, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "a thing that I will never be, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr.James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honoured to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people."
Mixed martial arts fans stayed awake all night watching Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent the whole night watching a full Bellator 206, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event had 13 fights, six of them on the main record, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, UK viewers were stunned when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy that they remained awake until the early hours of the morning, especially for the fight.
One Twitter fan described the transition to the children's cartoon as "a kind of bad joke."
With respect to transmission, Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications at Bellator, stated that "the government regulation states that at 6 a.m., this content was not suitable, so they had to switch to children's programming."
"Peppa the pig," yes.
Scott Coker, the president of the Bellator company, said they would work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about rebroadcasting, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"However, it is six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program switched, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can guarantee you this won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to give more for the fans and we ruined everything.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" in terms of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize before going to high school that "not everyone [was] like me."
As part of the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the issue of gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The usual presenter of the show, Kirsty Young, took a leave of absence of several months because of her illness.
appeared as a castaway on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" all the other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed."
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was "something," he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medallist is now a renowned LGBT activist and took advantage of his participation this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and so wanted to restore "hope" to others.
The triple world champion said he "did not expect" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When we live so much at such a young age" - he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had experienced the same ups and downs.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective" had changed.
"If you had questioned me last year, I was just thinking about winning a gold medal," he says.
"You know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 as a result of brain cancer.
Daley confided that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012, since he wanted to be seated in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, "Dad, you won't be there to be in the front row," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and die so that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"It was all I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympic Games, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, he was inspired by his first selection of songs - Heather Small's Proud - which had accompanied him in the preparations for the Olympics and always gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 a.m., TSB.
An out-of-shape Mickelson on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to get straight to avoid this being an unfortunate stage.
Mickelson, who competed twice a year for the twelfth time, a record, was set aside by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the five-time great champion shared his day between the role of supporting and fine-tuning his game at the stand in order to remedy his ailments.
He has never been the greatest leader, even at the top of his career. At 48 years of age, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough systematically punishes mishaps.
And as if the course wasn't formidable enough in itself, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth game, faces Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, four down at the start of the 12 singles games, make a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn't say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a slap in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great confidence in him.
He's a legendary champion and he's added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him play two games.
I wasn't planning, but that's how it happened and that's how we felt we had to do it.
He wants to be there, like all the others."
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the largest number of Ryder Cup matches ever played.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never quite reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven demis, although Furyk claimed that his presence brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think younger players had fun competing with him this week, which was fun to see.
He's doing much more than playing."
European selection captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the simples of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult course.
The Dane played his first game in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but finally climbed to the top of the standings with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep remembering that we were taking a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won, but narrowly," said Bjorn, after observing the 2018 Ranking to win 5-3 at both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and to all members of this team that this is not the end.
You'll have to do it tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have a goal, namely to try to win this trophy, and that is where we must stay focused.
I've always said I'm focused on the 12 players in our camp, but we're very aware of what's going on on the other side - they're the best players in the world."
Delighted at the performance of his players on a challenging golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never advance on this point.
Tomorrow's a whole other pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, individual performances will be presented, and this is not the case.
It's great to be with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, you're put to the test to your full capacity as a golfer.
Here's the message for the players to get the best out of you tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, you have to get the best out of yourself, too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players achieve better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced both ends of these last day swings, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before losing at the end of the "Miracle of Medinah", where Europe tore the victory.
"I remember every word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had rallyed his players on the last day.
"We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in a direction, puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We established our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we had to do, we try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was awarded the task of leading the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
"I accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the entire course," said Bjorn on his singles selections.
Germany's new warship still postponed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to defective systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship ship of the new frigates of Baden-Württemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems of concern that occurred after the delivery compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They will certainly be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as a radar, infrared and reduced acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent frigates for up to two years outside home ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the unceasing delays mean that the avant-garde warships - which should allow Germany to project its force overseas - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed F125 frigate made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after it was delivered.
The reasons for this return were not well known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless in the event of deployment on a combat mission.
The software failures were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg class of ships will be operated by a crew of approximately 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the vessel is significantly overloaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as the similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said that it reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), compared to 2.2 billion at the outset.
The problems associated with the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval force is decreasing.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is in fact "short of ships able to deploy".
The official stated that the situation had had a snowball effect over time, as the old vessels were downgraded but no replacement vessels were designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret lives of bats
New research in a Scottish Highlands field is looking to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
Researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will study common and sopranos pipistrellas as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of bat calls and the activities of the different species.
A habitat map and report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important areas of habitat for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as prairie creation and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects perches and results in habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly papers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to capturing prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to identify insects and obstacles on their flight itinerary.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, perch inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established the first and only reserve of bats in Scotland at the Threave site at Dumfries-et-Galloway, home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
David Thompson, domain manager, says the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave, we have an ideal place for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right habitat.
But there is still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we do here and in other places will help us better understand what bats need to thrive."
It stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out the maintenance of the properties, because by destroying without wishing a single maternity nest, one can thus cause the death of 400 females and young, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their perches.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and as far as many of our species are concerned, we don't know what's going on in their populations right now."
Ronaldo refutes rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges against him as "false information," and stated that people "want to make themselves known" using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep her silent on the incident, Der Spiegel said last Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million fans in a live Instagram video, a few hours after the allegations were broadcast, Ronaldo, 33 years old, described this information as "false information".
"No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information," the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or told the camera.
"They want to advertise themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel for these allegations, which they described as "unacceptable disclosure of suspicions in the area of privacy."
Counsel Christian Schertz stated that the player would seek compensation for "moral damages proportionate to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape occurred, according to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and assured him that he was a "good guy" at "99 percent" but that he did not know what was going on with the remaining "1 percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that they were consented to.
Mayorga also claimed to have gone to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently agreed to an amicable settlement because she felt "terrified by reprisals" and feared "to be subjected to public humiliation".
This 34-year-old woman states that she is now seeking to rescind this regulation, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged assault, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve under a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "forever regret" the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Trade, the United Kingdom "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He added that it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain withdrew from the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays at the border in the event of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles - built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
"I consider that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our plant," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota manager in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what car manufacturers call a supply chain risk in the event of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated in "stretched flow", parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers from the UK and the EU for custom-made vehicles.
If on 29 March the UK leaves the EU without agreement, there could be disruptions at the border which, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold the inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will, as I said, not only take advantage of the current success, but also seize this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to maintain what has proven to be an excellent set of supply chains."
While Toyota was unable to specify how long production would be shut down, it cautioned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the coordinator of the Unite union at the factory and who has worked for 24 years in Burnaston, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never return."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a clear and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
White House announces Trump and Rosenstein meeting may still be delayed
According to the announcement made Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "rejected by a week", while the struggle for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser charged with investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's collaborators and Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will dismiss the Deputy Attorney General, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has been fueling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken of wearing a microphone in order to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday, he came to the White House, when he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather not" dismiss Mr.Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission before which Kavanaugh and Dr.Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance at Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we're pushing back another week given all the other things that are going on in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I like to keep the press informed."
The claim would be challenged by some journalists: Since 10 September, Sanders has not held any press conference at the White House.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the scarcity of lectures was not due to an aversion to "demagogic" television reporters, although she said, "I have nothing against the fact that they impress the gallery."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without citing any evidence, she added that "the Chair participates in more question-and-answer sessions than any other Chair before him": "We checked the numbers."
Press conferences will always take place, Sanders said, but "If the press has the chance to directly question the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this frequently, as you have seen in the past few weeks, and this will take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
He rarely makes solo press conferences there.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and at times a bizarre appearance in front of the journalists gathered.
On concerns about Brexit, Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU officials working in the Scottish NHS expressing their gratitude to them and wishing them to remain in post after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of applications for status for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "During the summer, withdrawal negotiations continued between the UK and the EU and are expected to lead to decisions this autumn.
But the British Government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very troubling for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is quite your home and we really want you to stay here."
After a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
According to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the assist of the Tennessee Tigers, was urgently operated after a head injury on Saturday in the defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee's state, told reporters that the injury had occurred just before half-time.
"He arrived on the key line and collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a stretcher and taking it for another examination.
A state representative from Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris stated that there was "no detail as yet as to the type or extent of the injury" and that the State of Tennessee was attempting to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student athlete, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before coming out of the game, bringing his total of the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duties if they buy a property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new conservative regimes.
This measure will reverse Corbyn's successful campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to collect up to £120 million Sterling a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy a property in the UK - the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in the stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will be used to strengthen the government's efforts in the fight to help the homeless.
This surtax - in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and purchase-leases - could be as high as 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to £120 million per year.
About 13 per cent of new London buildings are purchased by non-residents of the United Kingdom, raising prices and preventing first-time entrants from entering the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who stay mostly outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing large construction companies to keep housing prices high by grabbing land without using it, he called on May to give up quotas on affordable housing with a view to settling the "real estate disgrace" in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of reform proposals in the housing sector, including the monitoring of rents and the elimination of “no-fault” evictions.
It also wishes to give the councils more powers to build new housing.
May said: "Last year, I said that I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
It is unfair, however, that it is as easy for individuals who do not reside in the United Kingdom, as it is for foreign companies, to buy a home as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of gaining access to property has become remote and the misery of the homeless remains too real."
Jack Ross: My final ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland technician Jack Ross explains that his "ultimate ambition" is to become the Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is pleased to take on the challenge of reviving the Northeast Club, which is now third in Ligue 1, three points behind the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for division B and that's all," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But I grew up following Scotland's Hampden games with my father and that's something I've never forgotten.
This opportunity would only arise if I succeed in the club's management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland breeders are Dick Advocateat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former technician of Alloa Athletic says that he did not hesitate to put himself behind such emblematic names in such a big club, having already declined Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question "Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?"
Thanks to the structure and infrastructure of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he added.
"It's not easy to get there, but I would probably only consider myself a success here if I managed to get the club back there."
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa climb up from a relegation in the third division and turned St Mirren, who was on the edge of the relegation, into a great winner of the championship the following season.
Ross is more comfortable now than during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
The support of Alloa "was no doubt a real crossroads," he recalls.
"I really thought being a coach was better than playing.
It seems strange because I did well, I made a good living and I enjoyed some valuable summits.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There's a lot of details to settle every week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach suits me very well.
I have always wanted to lead and now I do it, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I have been in my adult life."

According to a survey, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays.
The summer heat increased the income of the troubled British pubs, but increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that bars and pubs saw a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, who compiled the data, said: "The permanent sunshine and longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed the June model, where bars had experienced a 2.8% increase, except for restaurants, which suffered even more shock.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the catering sector in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are by far the most popular, with more points of resemblance than the declining restaurants.
Food ads have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Seems like people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst specializing in leisure and hospitality, said: "These results follow the trend observed since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in terms of off-home sales.
No wonder foodservice groups continue to experience difficulties, although a 4.8% annual average decline in sales is particularly painful, in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have been less opportune for food business operators, and time will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will give us a well-deserved rest."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowing down in implementation.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for UK pubs, bars and restaurants, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined sales of over £9 billion Sterling and is the industry standard.

The news has accentuated concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students reported having a "main" account to show to their parents
One in five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - opens an account on social media that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" - a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has increased concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported managing a cleaned "main" account to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who happened to fall on her 13-year-old daughter's secret website discovered a teenager who encouraged others to "rape me."
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have a double profile, with half of students acknowledging private accounts.
MSC Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the Scottish athlete most decorated in athletics and President Ian Beattie described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to capitalize on his vast international experience over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys immense respect in the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would benefit enormously from her participation in the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre events in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It was a trying job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement! »
Online, a breast pump ad that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertisement of a company offering a breast pump compares nursing mothers with cows during milking.
In order to mark the launch of what is called the "first silent breast pump in the world", Elvie, a consumer technology company, launched a bold advertisement inspired by a music video to show the freedom that her new breast pump offers to nursing women.
In a barn of cows filled with hay, four real mothers dance to the rhythm of a song whose lyrics are: "Yes, I would myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you didn't notice it, these are my breasts, not breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pump it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help the women milking."
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 visualizations and hundreds of comments, the video received contradictory reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"A poor decision than to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away from them within days of their birth," wrote one of them.

Another commented: "It's an understandable trauma for the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "Advertising so disconnected."
Others defended advertising, such as a woman admitting that she found the song "hilarous".
"I think it's a genius idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," wrote someone.
Someone else commented: "It's a fun ad for moms who pull their milk (often at their workplace or in the toilet) and feel like "cows."
It is not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they danced with the discreet breasts hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump is completely silent, without threads or pipes and discreetly inserts itself into a breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even go out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and DPE commented: "The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible feeling of freedom that this new breast pump will provide.
It's not the first time that Elvie's been on the front page of the papers.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children settled silently in a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable. This is partly due to the fact that the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies have made it difficult to place children with respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves undocumented immigrants and were afraid of compromising their own ability to stay in the country by going to the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their homes should submit their fingerprints and that this data would be forwarded to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified to Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no legal background.
"Almost 80% of respondents or family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
As a result, we continue to prosecute these people," said Mr.Albence.
According to shelter workers, in order to deal with children more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to plead their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons found to be ineligible will be promptly deported.
According to the speakers and the reports that have been submitted in recent months by the network of shelters, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violence or escape attempts.
In a large institution like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of his or her size, according to child rights advocates.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many find difficult to deal with.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Mualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they "would be treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Mualem claimed that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to wage this sacred battle until all Syrian territories were purged" both of the two terrorist groups and of any "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground.
Moualem said about the refugees, that the conditions were favourable for their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational concerns" that deterred the refugees from returning.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure that these returns are facilitated," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have indicated that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war is reached.
United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last rebel fortress in Idlib has made it possible to advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
Mualem stressed, however, that the agreement provided for "specific deadlines" and expressed the hope that military measures would target jihadists, in particular the Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and who "will be eliminated."
Staffan de Mistura, representative of the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and the opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the group's work should be limited to "the revision of the articles of the current constitution", and cautioned against any interference.
Why Trump wins a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the dismissal and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
Which would probably be "The most spectacular final of a presidency!"
At the moment, the public is showing no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-hour odds have more than doubled, reaching $1.05 million on CNN, and have almost tripled to $1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, which reaches 3.5 million viewers on major evenings, is the leading cable television channel.
"It's a matter that attracts people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC's "Designed Survivor" drama series, who talks about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comedian author and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And some irrefutable truths about sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr Trump.
Why? She asked him.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Ms. Scovell told me.
Chaos has a playful value.
Obviously, unlike anything on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the richest viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when we find ourselves watching for six hours a panel of experts debate how Bob Woodward used "deep know-how" for his book "Fear", on Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket ("a garment filled with pride" according to the Washington Post) and the consequences of the extravagant descriptions that Stormy Daniels delivered of, uh, Trump's anatomy.
For my part, I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
"If part of what he's doing feels like seeing a reality TV show, it's because he makes you swallow something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's changing teams and daily situation reversals (fighting with the NFL, congratulating Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode or we're lagging behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees at home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was hiding inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand out, not with Brett Kavanaugh who was preparing to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember when we were animating all these crazy shows and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money from the outside invades the tightest mid-term elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania was flooded with money, thanks to a readjustment of Congressional constituencies that allowed two incumbents to compete for the same seat.
This district of the Pittsburgh suburbs, which has recently been restructured, is the seat of Democrat representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another constituency in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is measured by another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which heavily overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former boroughs were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The race of the new 17th district started a confrontation with regard to the financing of electoral campaigns between the main branches of party financing, the Congress Committee for Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory last March in a very popular special election in the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won in the district by 20 points.
Political scientists have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, and then declined.
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington little opposed.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled Trump's leadership.
The representatives of the State Department decided to convene the heads of the United States diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against "their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokesperson for the Department, in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions have only been imposed on El Salvador, which received US aid estimated at $140 million in 2017, including drug control and development and economic support.
The sanctions envisaged, which included reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings continued, representatives of North and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from travelling to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus putting an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence now has the opportunity to speak at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three American emissaries have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new messages or severe punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr Bolton in the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the cover of anonymity.
Their comments were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying History
The next tile could be the report of special lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump's justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his investigation to the question of a collusion of Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress control changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to this body, as he prepares to represent himself before the voters and, perhaps, before a jury composed of his peers.
These are many "ifs," and I do not claim that Trump's fall is inevitable - or that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to organize a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up to him and pushed the Czechoslovaks back to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these divisions and the inevitable march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
The Americans are currently facing a number of these cleavages.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since the newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly register the president and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein states that the Times report is inaccurate.
"What will we say if the FBI's recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if he is confided to the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will hold Trump to account?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will pass a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
With this heritage as a legacy, I cannot fail to be optimistic about our future."

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident against the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a solid position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury deprived midfielder Graham Dorrans of his first appearance of the season until draw 2:2 against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the most of such a result to achieve feats.
"It was a positive point for us because Villarreal is a quality team," commented the 31-year-old forward.
"We got into the game thinking we'd get something and left with a point.
We might have been able to win in the end, but overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a bit of luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a tough match because they made a good result in their last game, however I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes to the club as such, but there is a factor of satisfaction about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is quality.
Let's hope we can move forward now, leave last season behind us and triumph."
Women no longer find sleep because of this fear about their retirement savings
Although the survey participants clearly knew how they wanted them to be looked after, few people talked about the issue with their family members.
Almost half of those who participated in the national study said they were talking with their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent reported talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do what they need to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance branch.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children about it: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost of care.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you determine how to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a cash value to help cover these expenses, or some other insurance on your assets - provided you have the means to insure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in passing.
Provide a health care proxy that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will verify your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Think of the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
"It's not just the finances that are at stake, but also the doctors?" Martin asked.

One man was repeatedly injured with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received several bullets fired with a compressed air rifle as he was walking home from a party.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
The police described the incident, which occurred at approximately 0230 TSB, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
Her injuries do not threaten her life and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, announced the authorities, and the balance is expected to increase.
As communications were paralysed, the relief services could not receive any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is more close to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, whose population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquakes and tsunamis took place.
Donggala is a regency that runs more than 300 km (180 miles) along the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The regency population, an administrative region located below a province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, particularly the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic fire circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years include:
2004: A major earthquake on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 reached the south of Java, Indonesia's most inhabited island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake shook the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake shook the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the devastation caused by the earthquake and the devastating tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes shook the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicions of domestic violence, contravening a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a statement issued on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the telephone from a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held on remand in the Mat-Su remand centre and is being held on unsecured bail of $500, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, that's for sure" when his plea was asked, announced the network.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means that he could be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor B offence, punishable by one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been laid against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged assault.
The case is pending before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of an intoxicated weapon in connection with the incident.
His partner claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behaviour to the PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of homes.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are out of order and the casualties are expected to worsen in the coming days.
The earthquake broke out just off the centre of Sulawesi, north-east of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Social media videos show the point of impact.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu at the time of the tsunami on the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a person suspected of a terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assailant who claimed eight victims - a rare punishment that has not been applied in New York for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, reportedly used a truck rented from Home Depot to attack a bicycle path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing pedestrians and a cyclist on his road last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" murdered the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the declaration of intent to apply for capital punishment filed with the South District of New York.
Both charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the judicial document.
A few weeks after the assault, a federal grand jury sentenced Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "detailed preparation and premeditation," the prosecutors said, calling the method used by Saipov "odious, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," said the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The South District of New York had not claimed the death penalty in the course of prosecutions for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years following the Cold War.
Both Rosenberg were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been incited to commit the attack after watching videos of Daesh on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the Daesh flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded not guilty on 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the decision to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty rather than accept his guilty plea and sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had already asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the Conservative conference.
The former UK Independence Party said politicians should "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's deputies suggested, it should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
Rear-ban Conservative MP Peter Bone said during the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom "would have already been released" if Mr Farage had been secretary to Brexit.
But the dilemma that Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided troops was highlighted by the Conservatives in favour of staying in the Union, who joined an isolated demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite threats from those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as from the EU.
The Allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostilities - and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its programme and "chaos".
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "get rid of Chequers."
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and be entrusted with negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out already," he said.
The Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We did not engage in world wars to submit.
We want to make our own laws in our own homeland."
Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely false."
Curator Andrea Jenkyns, who was in favour of the release, was also present at the march to tell the journalists: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote in favour, it is also the case of our party and our activists who travel the streets and make us elect first and foremost.
Give up Chequers and start listening."
In a message to Ms.May, she added: Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they honour their promises."
"Mr. Farage told the rally that politicians should be forced to "feel pressure" if they were about to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They try to deceive Brexit and we say to them today, "We will not let you get away with it."
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to put pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the people's army of this country that has allowed us to win the Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, pro-European followers walked through Birmingham before organising a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists branded Conservative banners against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives because of the security stakes regarding the implementation of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place the computer systems and all the technology for Canada, plus, for the friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real joke.
A good Brexit doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of running for president
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider the possibility of running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future on Saturday at a public meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, GOP representative in the states, who was co-chair in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the centre of the speculation that Trump could face in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters at a public meeting since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for the Chair.
Warren replied that the time had come "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means having a woman at the head of the state."
Arrested on the death of Sims from Louisiana State University
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the shooting death of basketball player Wayde Sims, an LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department participated in the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m. ET. Press conference.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying a man who appeared on the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed on Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims received a gunshot wound to the head and succumbed to his injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday at 247 sports.
Wayde defended his friend and was shot dead by Simpson.
When asked, Simpson admitted to being at the scene, in possession of a gun, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in police custody in the East Baton Rouge parish police service.
Sims, a 2m young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, including 10 as a starter last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton headed for the world title after the team's directives allowed him to win against Sebastian Vettel
It soon became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From pole position, Bottas made a good start and crossed Hamilton on the side as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to get into the storm at the end of the peloton, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes went through the stands one lap later and ended up behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the advantage after a wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inner part at the risk of resisting after a double defense attempt in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the very first round to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated much of the race while maintaining his tires to aim for a speed finish and ahead of Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally arrived in the stands on the 44th lap, but was not able to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight laps, with Raikkonen finishing fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an outstanding job of getting a two," said Hamilton.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who pointed out that she had not unveiled Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the Speaker did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee, but argued that the events in the Senate showed that people were "bad, disgusting and dishonest."
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the Senate these last few days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and wicked and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When they saw the disclosures and leaks, they said, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you disclose any information?
Remember his answer... did you disclose information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't divulge anything."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we disclose any information — No, we did not disclose any information,” he added, thinking of the honourable senator's impression.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford last July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak was from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't disclose his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill said.
"She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday night at the rally: "I'll tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defence of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual assault by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using these allegations for their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see wickedness, pettyness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control," the president told Mediaite.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars erased their Friday loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return game at Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the scoring with two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowlie brought home equality before Dwyer gave the Giants the advantage.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, securing victory.
This was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 Friday night in Belfast after being caught up.
This was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two sides, the Giants having triumphed in the last three games.
Dwyer gave the advantage in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
In a busy first period, Sullivan re-launched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt joined Cowlie at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team came together and Bouchard once again tied up with a goal giving a power play at 27:37.
Cowlie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, ensuring victory for his team by scoring a fifth goal at the mid-term.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people on board an aircraft escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died by ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can safely take off.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the region and a large number of people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite the escape of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to abandon his post in the violently shaken tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed on site to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt it was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, the spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our heart is broken to learn that," he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, with the country's disaster prevention agency indicating that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance sheet would continue to increase as many bodies were still under the rubble and many could not be rescued," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the agency.
Waves measuring up to six meters ravaged Palu who will celebrate a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Aircraft accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man disappeared after a plane crashed into the lagoon.
The airline managing the flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now states that a man is missing, after the 47 passengers and crew have safely evacuated the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that since Saturday afternoon, it was unable to track down a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were involved in the rescue of the other passengers and crew after the aircraft struck the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they had all been in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy stated that the aircraft had landed in the lagoon near the airstrip.
Witnesses estimated that the aircraft had passed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes indicated that the plane had arrived too low.
"It's a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes stated that he and the others were able to slip into the water to the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
l stated that the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working nearby to upgrade a wharf had also participated in the rescue by using a inflatable boat to transport people on land before the aircraft sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents recorded in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst presents chronology of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned its case on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to track the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett indicated that he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that indicated that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was at Chambers when he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to talk.
Sanford appeared on the stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he was "[mented] because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis removed the SMS, calls and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense is due to begin closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be held before the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by soaking their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The group wants to reconnect with its roots and make the hip hop political again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for dismissing her after "racist" text
A Nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message from the mother who complained that she was "still a black woman".
The couple refutes being racist, and equates prosecution with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed her dismay when she found in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was Black when she arrived for her first day of work.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOON ENcore UNE NOIRE," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS.
Yet instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her "uneasy" gaffe, Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Maurice, explaining to her that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipino instead.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent home by an Uber.
Now, Mauritius is suing the couple to seek compensation for their dismissal and seeks compensation of $350 per day for the six-month home service for which they were initially hired, but without a contract.
"I want to make them understand, listen, we don't do that kind of thing," she said at the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to terminate Maurice's employment, fearing that they would not trust him after having harmed him.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco at the Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it were by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's see!"
Assimilating the trial to "extortion," Plasco claimed that his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a "very delicate situation."
"You'd chase someone like that?
This is not a very pleasant thing to do," added the business banker.
While the case is still pending, the public opinion court did not hesitate to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, unveils a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of this letter: "It is difficult to put herself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's very fun, knowing what we know about Paddington's huge success."
She stated that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a small teddy bear, would have remained optimistic about the rejection of her work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had had a "sweet bitter" flavor after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as "a very important member of our family," and adds that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was quite calm, and he wasn't a pretentious man," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a successful child: you're proud of him, even if it's not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, his daughter was taken urgently to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save his life.
"Nad regularly called to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect her to get out of it," said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to maintain the heart rate were slowly running out of steam and leaving his system.
She had died some time before and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could neither scream nor cry nor cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning for her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Bereaved women lay postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards on a Welsh bridge containing inspiring messages and telephone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I'm forced to feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old and residing in Lydney, stated that her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated any room."
However, he dropped his job before he died, as he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid there's a training effect."
Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don't be silent - you need to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, a long-time friend of Ms. Davis, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt down, depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we saw his change of attitude.
He was at his lowest on Christmas day - when the kids opened their presents, he had no visual contact with them or anything."
She said her death had been a huge trauma to them, but they have to get away with it: "It's tearing for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to move forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for - a time-limited, scope-limited investigation - maybe we could bring some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would "fall" into a partisan impasse.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections will only take place in five weeks, on 6 November. If, as expected, the Republicans achieve a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to have the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr.Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and, through him, met his wife Ashley, who was his personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
We do not yet know whether Mr.Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-chairman, to split the vote and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea: number of deserters "falls" under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since the rise to power of Kim Jong-un seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unification, said that 1,127 desertions took place last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing tariffs demanded by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comments.
The vast majority of deserters in the North will ultimately be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee from China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China regarded deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriated them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in talks focused on the pending denuclearization negotiations.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in broad terms, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is impossible for us to be the first to achieve unilateral disarmament," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and says he is unfit to sit on the Supreme Court
Pelosi, the leader of the parliamentary minority, described the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and stated that he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments as part of a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved that way, they would have called her "hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes almost shouting and suffocating about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations about him "a grotesque and coordinated assassination" organized by disappointed liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that, according to her, Kavanaugh's testimony demonstrated that he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, since he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he discredits himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh if it were confirmed, and whether the Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he's not telling the truth in Congress or the FBI, he's not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, but he's also unfit to sit in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge of the DC Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a Conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh avoided the question of the possible reversal of certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and biased person to go to court and expect us to say, "Is it not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
She's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger overflowing, and she can't get her out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, do you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was a manager somewhere, who told me that she too was crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to say to the person she was talking to, when she was getting angry and crying, "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I found it brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an outlet to anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with inexpressible rage, was that I was seized by the skin of my neck by an elderly woman - a cold director who had always terrified me a little - who dragged me down a staircase.
"Don't let them see you cry in any way," she told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they're thrilled because they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr Hart had been caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Mrs Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
"It wasn't a carefully thought-out decision," she told me laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates running, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Someone had called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
As the campaign was very advanced, it had fallen behind in fund-raising, and therefore swore that it would not participate unless it raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters, who usually gave $1,000 to men, intended to give her only $250.
"Do they think I'm entitled to a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger with sexism - that she felt dizzy.
"You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled about the press reaction to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my gravestone.
"She cried?"
How the US-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The first rounds of the US-China trade war have been deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a disagreement between countries could benefit Beijing over the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The largest increase occurred this week with new tariffs affecting items worth US$200 billion (£150 billion), taxing half of all goods coming from China to the United States.
Each time, Beijing responded in kind, most recently hitting tariffs of 5 to 10 per cent out of US$60 billion worth of goods.
China has pledged to match the United States, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will be sluggish soon.
Backing Washington down means giving in to demands, but publicly giving in to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
The experts believe, however, that if Beijing can play its part properly, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic slowdown in any of the countries is in fact far more dangerous than what observers have previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, to the think tank of the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild this country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of that devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries sponsoring the insurgency.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team crossed the 14.5-point mark to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble during most of the tournament, pushed his start in the water at the 16th hole in par-3, giving up his duel to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of four players to have ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format, the first edition of which dates back to 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was put aside 5 to 4 by the less well-placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, bowed 2 and 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the European champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
"In general, I don't cry, but today it's stronger than me.
It was a busy year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help him," said Garcia with emotion after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram who defeated the legend of the American golf Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles last Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride, having beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy," said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four games in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time all weekend finding the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance about his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a certain moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players all played very well.
We're going to come together, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
We have to bow.
We've been overtaken."
Red Tide Update: Lower Concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
