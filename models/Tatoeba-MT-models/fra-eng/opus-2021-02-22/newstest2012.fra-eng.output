Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
In an amendment to the criminal law, the Ukrainian parliament refused the draft annulment of the paragraph concerning the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
MEPs rejected at second reading the proposed amendment aimed at reducing sentences for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having concluded an apparently disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgement is not final and the court must rule on the appeal of the sentenced person in December.
Tymosenko described the ruling as a political revenge of the regime and provoked a process of suspicions of partiality of the court also to the west.
The plan to annul paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was sentenced, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve.
Libyan victory
Libyan liberation or rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners have yet to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the victors in the elections are the Islamists, but are they moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the usual right of Sharia and we already know what this is about.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because for a robbery you cut off your hand.
Women can forget about emancipation, the possible disrespect for faith is punishable by capital punishment...
It is the Qur'an that will unite the society of opposite tribes in the place of the dictator's personality.
In Libya will rule such an order as we cannot represent ourselves and as we would certainly not like.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not benefit Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors accepted aid with gratitude from unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the NATO strikes, but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated every attack.
When it comes to looking for victors in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shooting, served Islam and our hairy turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
So there is no problem for the locals to get rid of the "crosses".
Without land use, oil companies will have easy access to black Lebanese gold.
Perhaps not so much, and the West will finally be able to boast of the protection of those concerned with human rights.
As long as we do not allow these followers of Sharia law to do so.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are in the spotlight of investors.
A tornado of statistics came on Tuesday on Europe.
Each of the states published GDP-related information for the 3A.
The Czech economy stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market is breaking every record.
Investors look not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries published earlier their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is forecast to grow by 0.5%, while France's GDP is forecast to grow by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany placed itself better than expected (increase of 0.3% instead of the 0.1% forecast), however France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (the reason for stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Statistical Office it is confirmed that we are moving towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, according to the forecast and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is what analysts predicted.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
The 10-year yield on bonds is 28.4%
Bond yields in Spain and Italy are rising to critical limits.
Problems are beginning to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Czech bond yields remain below 4% while the situation worsens in the region.
There are voices in Germany that the ECB should be the last instance guarantee .
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The football performance has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won with super Cech and goaltender Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also been very successful in the second part and will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a lot of luck for the second.
The Czech performance also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European championship.
The Montenegrins found themselves under pressure until the second part because of a precise Czech defence.
The vicissitudes of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances of scoring a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million kroner in the Czech football fund.
From the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
Both teams struggled to mount combinations and the game focused mainly around the central line.
The pressure from national footballers failed to break through the Czech defence, which responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred college students created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
With this gesture, they want to support their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from Isfahan universities created a human shield Tuesday around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre where uranium is transformed.
They openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclear programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
There is a report in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear programme, the targets would be not only Isfahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
The feeding of an obese child: does not have breakfast and takes charcuterie for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren are above average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the models that surround him is.
On the tables of obese children, for example, there are 50 per cent charcuterie more often than in families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese people had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness campaign "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of fat kids, sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most schoolchildren today - only 15% replied that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and involved 900 pupils from primary schools in Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", action supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever company.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or obese children is the lack of proper nutrition and not enough exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned indicate for example eating 5 times a day breakfast-in case - lunch - snack-dinner, which is a basic principle of a good diet", indicates one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast and cold meats at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that a healthy development requires some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of students' families eat at the same time.
In most families each has breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that's been noted is that one tenth of the population doesn't have breakfast at all.
Breakfast, however, is the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that the families of obese children consume unhealthy fries more often.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks sweet drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children questioned do sports regularly but for parents this is half, only 15%.
Get ready for your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own diet from the possibilities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating".
Among their favorite dishes are lots of cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming is in particular a high preference for sweet lemonade", is indicated in the survey results.
For lunch, pasta took the first place right in front of white meat.
Children did not want starch at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Focus on health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits once they receive ad hoc information.
"During a review of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness-raising session "Obesity is not a coincidence", there was a determined desire to move towards a healthy diet", the results of the survey were reported.
The most striking was, for example, in the case of sweet lemonade, as children began to give preference to drinking water.
Children most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as the main dish and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech speciality of bread flour pellets or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In a presentation article about how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry at the fact that there were a lot of them from the beginning.
I wasn't thinking about what would happen later.
The presentations of three professionals in the specialty, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on site.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we approach the final exams and the more we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays, it's really "bushed".
This time we have with Director Alenka (in the course there are no boys) treated the way to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women of this type are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without any particular curve, another of the overweight.
The stylist should know how to optically amplify wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We managed to highlight the character nicely and also not to dress too conspicuously types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
If, for example, there is a difference between waist and hips in such a way that skirts or pants don't pass at all, it's worth it to be made to measure.
And you will not regret it because the clothes that fall immaculately are priceless.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in the one that glides constantly, wraps up and doesn't hold to the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a Tucker style clothing, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or even embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that with regard to what I have to do at home there are too many.
Each intern received a celebrity to dress up for the day and evening.
We need to take into consideration the current appearance, the type of personality fashion and its appearance.
I'll have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, whom you may know from the Victoria Secret campaign.
Deep down, it makes me happy, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost a hundred pounds lately (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work the graphics.
Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Reflecting also on the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist not only dresses the physical in this way but creates for example productive pages in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, spoke to us about all this.
But this... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests from the specialty gave a diverse aspect to Saturday's session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, fashion designer, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with a single garment in a different way.
Variability is for this prime example.
Like for example this trench coat that should be worn in a classic way with jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with skids and take it as a picture like a dress.
Either just pull up the sleeves or the collar and immediately have a new look.
"Play with that," he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly".
"Then you can start contravening it," said Jakub.
Finally I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have many more variations of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say that for fashion story that will have about ten pages (so about ten models) I must be ready to "refine" at least fifteen pages.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We must count on that in creating a model.
The fact that image and style sometimes make half the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylists' services is still frail.
And the known faces sometimes consider them useless (it is enough that I know something but what I appear goes to the second rank).
And if someone gets a styling done by us, then we have to rely on the fact that he dictates to us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than he actually has.
Then we just have to go on google and make sure that the boulevard news mentions the celebrity in question, whether it loses weight or grows etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he dresses and it is thus important to be a good psychologist.
Know how to guess people, not flatter yourself, keep your opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort out her wardrobe and fill it with new elements, you can't throw everything away and tell her, my God, what a horror."
"You will find some things that you will find pretty and he that you will advise with what to carry them with," says Mario.
This one has shown us concretely what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
It's the one you hang around the waist and have on you for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things like scissors, depilation rollers or nurse pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which one closes a garment in the back, if it is too large (pin or other type of staple are not usable because they could damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
So that we were not only people who listened but who tried something in a practical way they taught us how to fit shoes properly.
And during the photo shoot in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, especially on the outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We were not allowed to touch the scissors so as not to inadvertently injure ourselves.
So we really need skills.
Mario made me happy when he congratulated me on my creation.
The count I'm referring to is not for my girlfriend.
This is only a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of the course.
I'm beginning to understand more and more that doing styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone should say what they want.
The need for speed The Run fights across America.
Revision
Originally a problem-free race is transformed by a set of stupid mistakes of people who don't care about it in a routine morning shift at work.
It fulfills everyone's ambition to a certain extent, but it is useless if no one wants to do something more.
The new subtitled game The Run produced great expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed race series and to release a kind of game from playable games that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how the added passages will be in which the main hero comes out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole pulls down because of some useless faults that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of incomprehensible idleness on the part of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught in the adventure where the main hero Jack has caracterial problems and to solve them starts to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
The result is that each race takes place on another route and the stages planned in different environments that differ quite well from each other and are interesting.
The player does not feel for a moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are pretty nice extravagance even if the graphic technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
I mean, it's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are in addition from time to time accompanied by an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Next to that, the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There are only a few, but that is enough.
There are moments when you try to exceed the requested number of opponents (as in a classic race) and then you run against the clock (classic duel with the chronometer) and then you wait for another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police entering the game and trying to make the situation difficult for you.
The novelty is the off-vehicle passages.
It's more like an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away in front of someone and you have to help him by typing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer times of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is this because this element is not likely to interfere and, in the context described above, is placed in the elements that enhance the game.
The driving pattern is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that at present there is nothing extraordinary, but it cannot be said to be negative.
As far as realistic simulation is concerned, you will have to go elsewhere.
But although one can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So it's all right.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
At the difference of the driving model, that of collisions is not yet perfect.
We don't expect this game to be a complicated distortion and collisions, but when you don't have, in a collision with any object, any idea of how your car behaves, it's not completely good.
During tight exceedances you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your self leaves in crazy voltigues.
Or you'll end up in crumbs.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really bothers you.
Rebooting is done so that when you broke the figure or you came out in the set the game will take you back to the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you have to start the game again from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool, in case something doesn't go right, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes restarts do not help and the solution must be found by remembering from memory the piece of route in question.
The great thing about this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are certain turns that need to be made in a certain way otherwise it does not pass.
Otherwise you meet on a given location "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds ahead or one minute late.
What makes you angry are situations when you easily see the opponent passing between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either put yourself aside and converse or brake them.
It doesn't matter if you go in front of him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always happens very close to your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you, you arrive in certain places, again without worrying about the time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This upsets the most at the end of the game when you roll on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must pass in front of you at all costs.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collid a lot of times.
You can understand that the goal of this game is to do something captivating and full of adedalin, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And that's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that's happening.
And it doesn't matter if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there's no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea is the change of car during the races.
You have to pay attention to the gas pumps on the itineraries because you can change car there however most of the time the one you have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, big American cars for straight motorways and super sports cars with exotic corners on very technical pipes for example on yaw roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places you know of adventure, goes very well with the main diet of history.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile, which is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
This one connects on-line with the Autolog function which inter alia compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult blows to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks like).
Your speedometer tells you between 150 and 200 km/hour (presumably) and behind you arrives a metro train that sends you the car directly to the scrap.
In writing we had a discussion for a few days as to whether someone really thought about creating this game or whether the authors really think of us as fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally nice and in some cases really great.
What is bothering is that in more extreme situations, imaging does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This applies especially to accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imaging is no longer useful to you.
The sound part is good and the track is of choice.
In order to please as many as possible and especially the young audience, a new sound track was created in the style of "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General Impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confused.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could safely say that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it is not finished.
The fun is really good but prepare yourself for mistakes to hit you in the eye with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.
Velvet students in concert with the choirs of Charles University
The Festa Academica festival offers for the third time festivities that link International Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical part.
During the festival there are 20 choirs from the higher schools and secondary classes.
The highlight of the festival was two concerts held on November 17.
"Charles University has an important part in this festival."
"Among the choirs there is the Choir of the Faculty of Pedagogy and Humanities, on the committee of the festival sits the Rector Vaclav Hampl", says the leader of the organizing team Jakub Calou.
The highlight of the festival is the concert of the Choir des lycées et classes secondaires which takes place with free admission on November 17 from 2 pm on the space located in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
On the programme there is the composition of the well-known Czech jazzman Karel Ruzicka, Celebration Jazz mass.
In the evening the concert "Etudiants de velour" takes place in the premises of the National House in Vinohrady during which the choirs of the higher schools as well as that of the University Charles are performed.
The goal of the Festa Academica is not only to celebrate the International Student Day with dignity and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present to the public a choir music of the highest level and to develop the creative cooperation of young people.

The program also offers high-level concerts, msical meetings, student happenings and other activities.
All information can be found on the Internet pages of the festival www.festaacademica.cz.
Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect such a hard war."
"It will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all the players get used to their new role", that is how Milena Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law the Czech Ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the different EU bodies and their relations in such an understandable and visible way, to the point that a large number of lecturers from the Faculty of Law at Charles University might envy her, she showed how serious she takes her wordto "understandable and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the critics sounded that he is bland, that it is a leather ring, that he cannot repeat any mission and I must say that he has taken the breath away from everyone because he holds his role to perfection".
"He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take of Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is in the European Union?" "What telephone number should I call?", so as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater legibility of the Union's policy vis-à-vis states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our syrecky (cooked cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that the European Council has lived, lived and lived in the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency two years ago a success.
The Czechs have resolved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or have organised an Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the fall as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of Mrs L'Ambassadrice, "the activity has been in full swing" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis which is still being resolved now.
In addition, we must approve the Union's new septum budget, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it would appear that the budget will be thin and for savings, which branch will have the priority, which countries will be assisted the most, the least, everything is to be solved in future negotiations.
Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted pickles, bananas of different size or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky".
She wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
Moreover, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault is, in her view, the result of several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a cover letter and the lack of support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she then underlined the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Pole, the Magyar, the Slovak come to me, this Frenchman says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this Visegrad group doing again?' and he is not happy at all."
In the near future, according to Mrs Vicenova, the Member States are waiting for tough new rules on fiscal policy.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not a multi-speed Europe, that prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute for Enhanced Cooperation".
In the first place it was said that co-operation between the countries that want it and those that do not want it remains in their corner."
"There will be a lot of such institutes and there will be a truly two-speed Europe," says Vicenova.
From this point of view it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis according to which all themes having an impact on the EU should be discussed between all EU members and not just the same members of the Eurozone.
History of a brand:
IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to look for the word that expresses the IBM strategy as closely as possible, the closest would be "the long term".
For a large audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The basis for this long-term strategy was laid by the firm's first leader, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left the slogan that many global problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE" has become the imprint around which the life of a giant future will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
This was the basis of Watson's carefully developed company culture.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years because it always remained true to its core values and yet was not afraid to change all the others around it.
This has enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more lamented for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to look after his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people were the only first American employees to have paid vacations, employer-paid insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of awards for inventors and commercials.
In the same way IBM has a system of well-developed customer relations.
The company was at first brilliant in discovering talents- as one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has been with IBM for thirty years and currently holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years has done what is called jamy, online brain-storming from which come many future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people who work.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures it a secure position in the field of business.
"From the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technology firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology," added Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating that market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is familiarly called in the United States in terms of its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown up to become one of the largest companies in the world.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services in terms of server products up to nanotechnology.
She holds numerous patents from all US technology firms and five of her employees have received a Nobel Prize.
His discoveries include the ticket machine, payment card, financial swap, barcode or diskette.
IBM ended up this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in advance
Not all innovations and manufactures were preferred by the customer and at the time - IBM, for example, did not succeed in the bet on a clean OS/2 operating system, Prodige online service or IBM PCjr computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the advance movement you cannot emotionally stick to the past," observes Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM does not have a problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it goes away.
Unlike for example the Microsoft concurent that at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a prominent place.
However still in 1990 she was with more of the participation motorbike the strongest representative of hardware.
Starting in 2000, IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, and over this period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-oriented technologies.
It continues to invest and even from 2008, when for the first time it surpassed the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased his investment volume.
It now appears that IBM is passing the current crisis without being worried?
The IBM share price has progested from 2008 on a 120 percent rocket, the firm's net profit continues to grow.
IBM's logo is to change everything but not its values.
We can expect this flexible giant to control other crises.
History of IBM: From cheese slices to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago and initially had the complicated name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It was named IBM in 1924 - originally a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 1980s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointers", pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 chaired the company's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then cast a shadow on the founder of the firm - Watson's ideas have been the foundation of society's identity and culture to date.
Watson headed the firm in 1952.
IBM, as his name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce - from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
During Watson's first four years of leadership, sales increased to $9 million and began to expand in all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable to the firm that after 40 years of management, his son occupied the director's chair, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM's people and computers helped NASA guide the flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to take care of consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded IBM over the last three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and city management.
With regard to the field of commerce IBM has recently developed a platform "Smarter Commerce" that helps trade to manage the whole business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in our territory.
She founded her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also Brno's strategic outsourcing centre.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the research and development team at the global level that deals with speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep that donkey, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
Only she couldn't wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova took refuge in Bartosova in the summer in her house, she had no idea that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not push the singer away.
And he confessed in public that he loved her.
In time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's affair and ended up saying goodbye forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome him on the doorstep of the house.
"He's my sons' biological father and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my old ass loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship", let Rychtarova filter by showing that she has separated from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door for him is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and not change."
"My wife set up a wedding on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we talk completely normal but we don't sleep together," said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop him.
"We don't sleep together and I'm not interested in knowing where she's going, with whom and whether she's having an affair.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take all responsibility for myself," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Does this concern you too?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all of them, both of them, are able to get them out of their sleeves.
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines female vices that manage to pump blood from men's veins.
Procurement
Does your half of you comment that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one garment a week?
Are you happy to buy and package at the time of sale?
In your case we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you will say, which one would resist the window shopping of clothing stores, to look for nice clothes for yourself and then try them all in the cabin (ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women to buy is a hobby, it can become a real hell for the man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse that he's waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat"?
"I would need to lose weight at least 5 kilos - should I start playing sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Don't those sentences remind you of anything?
Yes?
So you're one of those women who's obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop caring for yourself but a large number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases and the more women become poisonous.
Ode and cleanliness in first place
It's like an infinite ride.
Washing windows, vacuuming, cleaning floors, dusting, stripping the bathroom - twice a week.
You make remarks to your partner that he is walking with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they have soiled the sink, smashed the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer precisely from this obsession, try to bear in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be the first place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness, however, can spoil your relationship and even family peace.
The work of sape
"Put that worn-out tracksuit in the trash can."
"You're gonna put those old socks on tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor."
If you do this job on your partner this way several times a day, you will really break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think wrong you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much sap work...
Defamation, persiflage
Defamation, persiflage, but also insults against someone are also the property of some women.
Women are particularly involved in relationships and thus are happy to treat subjects as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each one of us is letting out a little harmless persiflage here and there.
The hand on the heart is however a special feature of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persive, even despise others and are for their surroundings - especially at work in a collective of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped with their participation in the Philadelphia victory
Hokeyist forward Jagr has twice taken part in Philadelphia’s win during Monday’s NHL game on Caroline’s ice and is again leading productive Czech players for the contest.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made one more pass and was named the best player in the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the game.
Jagr after the match told the overseas journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game that he'd give his hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," Jagr explained after his action Giroux scored a goal in the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second assault on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes for the puck and presented him to the scorer Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Concretely in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the top three," said Jagr about his center.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of my career with a hokeyjist like him."
"I'm really happy with that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at the NHL the other players on the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she finishes with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that ended in two to one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He hit the puck, I got speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the final goal of the game from his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia came with this victory at the top of the Eastern Conference.
Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo he went out in the second third because of an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candians did not stand against an experienced defender their two-goal lead and lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
It was the fact that the rear line was sick that mostly bothered the local coach rather than the lost points because they played the game only with 5 defenders.
"It sucks."
"We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young people."
"But there's nothing to do, that's how it is," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement over replacement wasn't enough and we couldn't resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the puck out of our zone."
For this we had limits," added one of P. K. Subban's defenders.
Czech defender Ondrej Pavelec took part in the thirtieth Winnipeg attack and victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax goals of the Jets, who stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered trips mainly to the countries of the socialist bloc, as trips to the west were very limited.
Czech tourists travelled for holidays in Eastern Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a inclination for the west and trips to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of socialist countries.
In case the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually for example to Poland or the Soviet Union he needed an invitation letter otherwise the individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to queue up all night with a sleeping bag or to have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The currency deal that was the condition to travel to the west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of currencies (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs spent most of their holidays in the country where there were consequently many country houses and cottages that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
Since 1989, the Czech journeys have undergone a major revolution.
Although up to 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at most, Czechs spent 4 million days abroad last year in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s of the last century in neighbouring western countries has caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for a long time travel by plane to the west which everyone wanted to see at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris travel organizations made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay for the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a Czech trip was at that time to take with you his own preserved food, sausage, etc... to save money.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech koruna, which finally allowed our tourists after decades to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wage have increased which has caused around 1997 another important moment.
As a result of growing demand for travel, travel agencies have begun to prepare tours with air charter routes since 1997 which, thanks to contracts, have dramatically reduced costs compared to previous ones.
At the end of the 90s of the last century the Czechs had visa-free connections with almost most developed countries around the world except the EU which later facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when was prepared the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as every year, direct air charters take Czech tourists to distant warm countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development arrived in 2008.
On 17 November 2008 the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully integrate into the developed countries group.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time again in history spent more than 15,000 kroons per person on holidays abroad including related expenses. Crowns per person.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this may end in a situation without a solution "one pat"
Almost 5 months already Czech football is without president and it risks that Ivan Hasek's successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after another General Assembly to be held on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on the voting rules.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the leadership of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek football went back to differences between the Association's chambers that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely demonstrated on 16 September when a new president had to be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained blocked and there was even no question of dealing with how to elect.
There was no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly — only, apparently, statutory representatives or staff members with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since that moment with the assistance also of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
There are still differences about the election rules.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not contributed to the situation either.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the issue remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the pat.
"The point of contention lies in the fact that either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Czech Republic Football Association Dusan Svoboda, which represents professional football within the association.
In the third round, according to the rules of the model, the number of candidates who received the highest percentage of votes in the Chamber for which he is a candidate shall be increased.
Moravia is prepared according to what is said to withdraw so that the candidate who receives the highest percentage of votes from both chambers wins.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only then would it lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely deny the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the Moravian party and according to whom it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees, even if he believes that the election rules established according to the statutes benefit most Pelta among all the candidates.
"I hope that we can vote as much as possible according to the statutes of the association."
"To ensure that there are not yet any wild ideas imagined by a representative as in past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations was defined mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The possible qualification today in the European Championship should calm everyone down".
"Soccer will once again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more enthusiasm for cooperation," adds Jablonec's officer, who among the three has the greatest experience in managing football both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between Czechs and Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change drawing regulations."
"This can cause the General Assembly to freeze again."
"I still hope that healthy reason will win," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but who can tell if the whole leadership of football will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorice, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was being sought to take part of the Executive Committee to the field of reprisals.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the torn parties in the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to battle for the post of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If Plzen Tomas Paclik's head of football had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to all he asked for a new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be campaigned for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I don't run for office."
"But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech News Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to enter into competition with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to precisely try to prevent Pelta from entering the head of the AFRT which would a priori be given favorite for this election.
Paclik also points out that in the event that he wins the elections, he would hold the post of President only until 2013 for a General Assembly.
He would see in the position an experienced and high-level manager who is not linked with the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he says.
"For me it was terrible when some told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change this image," he added.
What is said to be particularly disturbing is the relationship between Pelta and the President of Plzen Roman Berbr's regional football union, a man with a counter-versed reputation who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates 'the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable for Pelta to occupy this position of President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying merchant, this would be even less favourable to football," Paclik said.
What further shocks him is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago during listenings in connection with an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta managed without any penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA" said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell Plzen's club".
In the event that Paclik triumphs in Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been endorsed by Paclik before the September General Assembly which ended with a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I would go with."
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able to present himself as, for example, head of the representation."
"But as a manager of the Association he wouldn't be able."
"I don't put my nose into what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September drew great attention when he voted in favour of the annulment of the Arbitration Commission with Ludek Macela that replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his abilities to run private firms and that he also runs since last year the Plzen club which celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it."
"I would slow down the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," added Paclik, who does not hide his antipathy for the leader of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonising relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose power to lobby for high-level policies would make it possible to obtain more money for sport from taxes on games.
"This is one of the key points the new President should address."
"If this is the gambling tax as political parties say, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current relationship with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the AFRT president should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla from Prague.
"It's not ideal."
I don't see any reason to pass on my actions from Plzen club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later," Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that should put an end to pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidate Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end in the future to the quarrels about the rules for elections.
The official of Jablonec is before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and thinks that the success of the football representation today should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta before the September election which did not happen promised to devote itself precisely to national representation and to obtaining financial means if he is elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the last General Assembly, and this delay of two months might well allow him to defend his vision of the leadership of football and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a president on Thursday."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the leadership of the Association," he adds, but he is primarily connected with the Jablonec club, has worked for many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
This is also why he has enough experience to run Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the General Assembly in June the statutes were approved which were not perfect as all noticed".
"If there weren't all these different interpretations we'd have had a president since September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took all the attention of the delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as my personal mission and am prepared to take all the responsibilities in case it doesn't work."
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist," Pelta added.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his adversaries.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes with regard to his legal education and that he fully knows that his opponent-applicant will be his first Vice-President.
He hasn't attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, which on the contrary keeps criticizing Pelta.
"He's been playing football for a year and has already had a few successes."
"His attacks, however, were not most honourable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"This is also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said to his opponent, but remains, he says, faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level to the national representation.
It should be a football vicorna.
"And I would also try to complete all the cases that begin with the Bohemian case or the continuation of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," the 46th candidate told the Czech News Agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not result in any change of people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he said in Strahov, where there has been an understandable nervousness since there has been no management.
Although there were catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believed that delegates would not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is only one point of discord on how to vote in the third round we will manage to overcome it".
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader at its head", as Pelta optimistically states two days before the day probably decisive for his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT would start working hard
"If today's Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Czech Republic Football Association in Thursday's General Assembly it would not please many people," he said.
Rajchl promises however that in case he is elected we will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and making the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various fields of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian affair, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President I want to handle football in its entirety."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and high performance football for youth."
"But I'm not saying I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for TKC.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member will deal with a specific area."
"And I will distribute difficult missions so that football faces a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because it will be a matter of starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
It was said that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it's worth it and if I'll have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and raise doubts about each of my actions," explains why he hesitated.
"Many people still told me that I should not give up because they would give up too."
"It's a trust I can't betray," he says.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work begun with Hasek.
"For the last two years there has been a great work of fact and I don't want to let him down."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them.", he said with fear that in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and this is something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"Behind him are people who would make football in such a way that it would only be for those who were chosen."
"I can be blamed for a number of things, but certainly not for putting up with anyone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football for all because everyone will be happy with it not only those who have been chosen
And he confirms again that he would only be a president for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are those who say otherwise, I am ready to do the utmost for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, whose winners would end up in the first division."
"There would be no situation like currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the post of President, Rajchl cannot evaluate his own chances of winning.
"I always feel the support of the Czech Chamber which elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be success," said Rajchl who plans among his future successes to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, contract negotiations with televisions and on the law on games.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault.
While he said about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has enough to offer football.
"No one can question Plzen that he has done a great job this year."
"If he were elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make any noticeable change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to spoil his successes," said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.

Oven optic paddling pools, beautiful pools of Budapest: Who travels across Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can let rest his tired legs in baths of sparkling water.
A book shows in which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder was on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is one item that should not be missed in his luggage: his swimsuit.
Spread on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged domes, and swam against the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If an indoor swimming pool pleases her, she immediately noted in her notebook all the details worthy of interest on the type of construction and on the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and they have presented them in her already published book: "Badefreuden (Joies of the Bath). The municipal covered swimming pools of Münich, the historic bath palaces in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She led her "travels to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Alongside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true devotee of bath culture.
Meder, explains that she doesn't have much interest in sport but she feels attracted to water in a totally different way.
It is irritating that swim fans should simply contemplate blue tiles and accommodate the stench of bleach, while joggers breathe the scent of spruce forests or can listen to joyful bird chirping in the park.
"I once wondered why swimming pools should in fact always be so ugly," said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
Diving in a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - well-being factor in swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders would have taken a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real delight to the eyes: "Instead of a floor you have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is on one side transparent, but on the other side reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multicoloured tiles, springboards.
The small format image volume "Badefreuden" makes a worthy 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to make a jump in the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
Besides the splendid well-being baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (crop bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths whose basins are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the outdoor heated swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While a roof of the Zürich bath has the whole city in its eyes, one can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which one can observe the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background rise the mountains of the Ötztal towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of bleach does not come from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulphur, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanate a strong smell of oil, which it is hard to believe, to be in a health spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen which is almost black and its silt sticks you to the skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for beautiful pools, Iris Meder was also disappointed: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricade.
The bath designed by architecist Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was in the meantime closed.
By looking through the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the blooming of weeds between the tiles.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad Thermal Palace.
This building has already survived three phases; one can discover not only neo-Roman elements that come out since its conception in 1844 but also a Moorish room in the Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favourite bath of the pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it is native to Schwarzwald.
"It's already a great performance to melt so different construction styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.

German bank examines commodity speculation in detail
From Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation on raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann set up a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the point is clear: According to one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as maize and wheat.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the speculation of the stock exchanges on global raw materials pushes prices upwards and that the banks share an complicity in the global famine.
The consumer protection campaign is in concrete action against Deutsche Bank leader Josef Ackermann, even if big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting in the same way.
Speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts in the meantime share the view that wagers have been detached from the offers and demands - and profit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted differently to the criticism of American competitors: He promised to investigate the accusations and said, "no business is worth putting into play the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the Foodwatch-Report accusations.
The examination must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank's board of directors must be presented - usually with a recommendation.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could lead to a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his Image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The speculation on the rise in food prices shows in a particularly draconian way, to what extent today's banks harm the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's about hungry people or whether Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may seem surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving office.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything as planned in the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with a move away from controversial agricultural speculations.
And about possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would terminate investments in raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday survey, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires to 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Just eleven percent found it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many of the bank's customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: one in two would cancel, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
Forty-three per cent would not recommend such a bank to their entourage, 49% replied that they would consider cancelling their account to change their banking establishment.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion That Moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups, downs and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin.
Now it is open again and acts as an exhibition house.
If you are enthusiastic about a modern post-war architecture, clear shapes, glass hangars, bold and bold looks and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its steel and glass construction, light and suspended.
Construction is considered until today an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian World Exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house and its adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the South Vienna railway station, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it was used for so long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and has become increasingly dilapidated.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it is now called the "House of the 21st Century" and will in future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Belvedere Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck from any point of view.
The new start was carried out by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in her youth as an artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, she carried out particularly successful transformation work with politicians and the protection of monuments, she obtained public funds and private sponsorship and established exploitation.
Except for contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a café and a bookshop are there, and an office must be built there.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and sensibly expanded the secession of Joseph Olbracht and had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of its move to Vienna and its change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: the building was "an energy abyss", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, fibreglass reinforced insulation glass was installed and the roof replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridge beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a sign of light sifted between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but still the light Pavillon Schwanzer.
The original exterior doors remained, the house is painted in a rust-resistant hue of red-brown color.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials which are good and cheap had to be found, and which also appeal to the office of protection monuments," said Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and nevertheless wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a coup de chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands precisely the "neighborhood of the central station" newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And perhaps another chance will come: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as he says, she is already negotiating with the city to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees is expected to double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million more this year.
The daily "Bild"-Zeitung has previously reported, citing an internal crisis plan within the group, that investments of a total of approximately 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snow removal of railway installations and docks should, among other things, double to 16,000.
The objective is to clear the docks of snow and ice up to the beginning of the service phase and 90 percent of the track equipment required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago station manager Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a summit conference of train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems with the transport of users, because it lacks reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been awaiting authorization from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had a lot to do for years, since it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked significantly more often at the shop, after an axle rupture has occurred on an ICE at the central station in Cologne.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the USA.
After the affair of chief Josef Ackermann there is news in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already enough, the past of this giant of the sector is catching up with him in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison with 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator charges large banks with a wide range of accusations of having encouraged cooperative banks to make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized risks.
These documents lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and led banks down.
"We are satisfied that we have been able to find a solution to this issue without the parties initiating proceedings in the court," said a Deutsche Bank interlocutor in New York.
The Bank has not acknowledged any faults in comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
The President of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for cooperative banks in the USA and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the multi-billion dollar damage.
The comparisons made now are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks in part and in the summer he appealed to the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the question of mortgage documents, it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even if the events are already a few years old, at the present time there is a stormy wind on the American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous appeals to obtain redress or to punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) triggered the largest wave of complaints.
She blames 18 major international banks, the two US state-owned real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for taking advantage in kind during mortgage deals of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with FHFA, which is a number of transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without mentioning a specific sum.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unjustified and stated that it wished to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the financial guru, invests colossal sums in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until then the big American investor Warren Buffett constantly explains not to invest in IT IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only reveals bad prognosis.
However, he read IBM's reports and changed his opinion on investment in this sector.
He had already had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and IT systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight's attack in the world of finance.
Consequently, the IT IBM business is now entitled to call itself "Mr IBM".
Buffett today revealed to the CNBC economic issue that he has purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM never knew anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, who even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable profits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been relying for some time on IT lucrative services as an operation of accounting centres.
The pioneer of IT, over 100 years old, offers both Software and consulting as well as high-performance enterprise calculators.
Buffett had so far avoided technology companies.
He says he's only investing in the companies he understands about.
But on the contrary Buffett is more concerned with rail freight, lubricants or machine manufacturers.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares in a range of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Rück Munich.
This 81-year-old had taken over Berkshire Hathaway's small textile company in the 1960s and had made it one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to intelligent investment.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That's why he's a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of earning money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of Buffett's investment IBM shares increased by one percent on the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", also known as IBM, has a total market value of over $220 billion and counts with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, says Buffett, he doesn't want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology," which would be reborn now.
The assassinations of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
For many German-Turkish people, the spectre that had long been thought to be dead has reappeared: since the incendiary attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable to this extremist right-wing context against the Turks.
That there is xenophobia in Germany, however, has never been mentioned.
The extreme right-wing network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions that are far from predictable in size.
"Is it a return to the bloody ideology", "This was the title of the internet publication of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, points out that one of the authors was a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right quagmire.
The Turkish community in Germany responded in a reasoned manner: this weekend it called for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence outside the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks before that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish policies had thought of a ceremony on the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that the cohabitation was staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media make the effect of a slap: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Thus the German publication of the "Hürriyet" is not deprived of univocal conditions.
"It's starting to stink," this is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He pointed out that people had been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was perceived in a very critical way on the German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why it has not already come much earlier to the mind of the German authorities to carry out research in certain suspicious right-wing circles, the authors wonder.
More than one is at least prepared for rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the matter continues to be sloppy, nothing will remain for migrants other than self-defence and armament".
"it will be the best self-defense."
"Inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," writes Selen.
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have well explained.
The photo of the ruins after the fire in Solingen is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which mistrust and distance through acts of violence can lead.
The attacks have, however, sharpened our sense of belonging in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past mistakes
In the past, it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks that the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current Turkish media report once again shows how deep German-Turkish distrust of the local rule of law has been since then.
In addition to the efforts to further clarify and re-evaluate extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
Zürich Lake Scandal Bank
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost gone bankrupt in the financial crisis and in the meantime patinas from one crisis to the next.
He's a German who has to run now.
That's certainly not what Axel Weber imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it became known in July that he would hold an almost as spectacular position in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly welcomed, praised; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently achieved solidity and made some kind comments on future colleagues.
"UBS made it to Turnaround."
"I welcome the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
And yet, as early as September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all of the Bank's security systems and had flung around 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has since been considered suffering - and all ask: When does Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency already in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
At one time he took responsibility for a bank's strategy, which had once again proved that it had long deserved the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
Indeed, UBS is on one huge side - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been patinating for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, spares the proud Swiss bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also cunning, combined it with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from a wealthy customer base than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later bank professor for many years in Zurich says: "I have always taken UBS as a model of good bank in front of my students."
"From the current perspective, one wonders: how could I have simply been so wrong?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something was wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli withdrew in a surprising way, who was previously considered a top intellectual as well as a great banker.
A few months later, we sensed why he had left.
The division of the bank had flaming with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross on billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this it has indeed found investors, but who, shortly before, would have frowned: a non-transparent Asian state background from Singapore and an Arab state background, which was ignored, to the point that its name has never even been known.
But it was only the first blow.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank was to announce again billions of losses, the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still Switzerland's second highest paid board in 2006, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was, in view of its investment errors, in the pre-bankruptcy financial crisis and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation donated six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to shelter such large banks.
Finally, the UBS 2007 balance sheet total amounted to more than five times Switzerland's economic performance (see graph).
"We couldn't save UBS again," says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster it followed the second.
Already a few months before, UBS had capitulated due to a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the wealthy customers, who had defrauded the tax perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in return for unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus UBS more or less published that it had helped with tax evasion.
At the same time it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the outflow of customer money.
Thus the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors within a few months: banking investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to aid for tax evasion.
And, as there was a bit of a return to calm, and as we thought, that the UBS would get away with it, there followed this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single title dealer flaming 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it's published: with risk management in investment banks it still doesn't seem to work.
"With the Adoboli case, we have seen that the mastery of risks has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the University of Zurich's Banking Institute.
Also the chief financial officer of a large German bank is sure: "the problem with UBS is that it does not have control of risks in hand."
However, it was precisely the idea of prudence, with which Swiss bankers had long taken up their duties, that of becoming guardians of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS power plant in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the solid cliché of the Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank has its headquarters at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from Zurich Central Station to Lake Zurich, which is surrounded by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, the rents of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers like Tiffany's can be found here between the shops of Swiss traditions as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss bankers have resided here for centuries: from the national bank to the Swiss Credit Palace to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered in marble, in front of them are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another pushed out of the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business also with the two major banks.
The UBS would have become far too large, he says - especially in banking investment, where Anglo-Saxons have also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing to say.
"And even so, they have long adapted to the manners of Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution lost so much money in the jungle of sub-prime like the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country with seven million inhabitants undertook the biggest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians agreed to save the large bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If we talk with Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three major Swiss banks together concluded a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for small Switzerland - and has been constantly growing.
What helped was that the two different UBS predestined banks completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with the strength of asset management in Zurich and a poorer one, but certainly already more strongly internationalized.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favourable access to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who understands very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who made his way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted Wuffli until the end.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: exuberance happened before the fall.
UBS staff clearly remember the leaders' meetings at which the leader of the Wuffli group always spoke the same slogan: dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" the rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all, UBS wanted to go upstairs.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In terms of currency and securities transactions it played a very important role.
However, the corporate advisers, who were responsible for it, pointed out a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
UBS would have deficiencies in U.S. mortgage proceeds.
To fill this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost it its life.
Assailed by growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the US sub-prime investments that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packaged and passed value documents based on American mortgages - but also kept risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to come down.
"Still in the summer of 2007, while the US real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there," said Geiger, the banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts proved more difficult than we thought.
Posts at UBS have become ejectable and so far are sloppy.
Whoever runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger, already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, to concentrate on the management of assets, to return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment bank has to atrophy vigorously, as far as is clear so far.
Next Thursday bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has established himself: he must conduct the affairs of the UBS on a sustainable basis, said the Bank of Zurich on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the status of the mid-1990s.
He's canceling 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He says publicly so far only that he was going to search with his wife for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.

American investors have expressed in a skeptical way: "We are not an island, on the other hand dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from the banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, only confirmed this caution: "It is not yet clear if Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, in his view, it was too early to invest in bonds from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle into the wind and entered the American technology industry.

Smart crows spread through cities
In many places, birds are considered to be a "bird problem" but experts say that these very intelligent animals have not been hunted from cities for a long time.
Some love them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows have been owned by the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are increasing because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote against the "no bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts said that it is no longer possible to hunt the chills of cities.
Experts from all over Germany deliberated on possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in cities
Nature's protectors were also basing the problems of cities on the exodus of particularly protected fries: The use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, developing, and felling typical brood trees made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with over 600 brood pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest, including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project won negative advertisements because of the crow massacre in this region.
Critics found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal gourds.
"Normal eviction, eviction, is useless," said Werner Klöver, the city and landscape planner for Leer.
The destruction of nests using pressure water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are moving away, the large colonies are dividing and they are scattering to other places."
Evitation can only be imagined in exceptional cases, such as hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We are obliged to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem is not solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Concevable is a combination of the eviction of animals with aversive packaging and catchy offers, to allow them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens was looking for "info panels instead of chainsaws" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better support a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Schleswig-Holstein Ascheberger-transportation-educational baskets, road signs informing about the lives of these very intelligent fries.
In the meantime, this project has been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "There is a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say to each other".
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Frauds not only use work instruments to arrive at a feast but they themselves make their tools as work instruments.
Ethologists at Cambridge University recently tested four fries, the extent to which the intelligence of birds is coming.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to collapse a scaffolding with stones to achieve a larva.
Without much training, they recognized that a stone had to have certain size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second trial, cunning crows had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their loot with their beaks.
However, the researchers had put pieces of wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four fries are successful even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks at a time remained unsuccessful.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland will take part in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the playoffs at the 2012 European Championship in Poland and shot eliminated Ukraine.
Driven by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal lost to Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made it perfect, after the 0:0 of the match, his fifth participation in the European championship.
The Czechs reached the playoff return game by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first inning (2:0), had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was also hotter in the 0:0 draw between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 release (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11m-penality played by hand (41') and Captain Emir Spahic (65') twice made a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red map (54').
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free-kick 30 meters in advance into the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his firing qualities at a distance and fired at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to attacker Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger, the leader of the English championship in Manchester City, initiated a head ball directed to the bottom of the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek got a goal for the Czech
Finally the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding in the center of all the attentions.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36').
On the opposite side, Stark granted a penalty of 11 meters played by the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But after the break, the 2004 European vice-champion made four hits and everything became clear.
For the Czech, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for a fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), also got lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalie Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9’).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the cross had to come to the rescue of the Czech world-class goaltender already shot down, again, the attacker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey was missing the Zagreb football miracle during this time.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the 2002 EM third-place bench in the same way, the Croats were able to rejoice in their fourth round in the final of the European championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia gained control more and more.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund in the 62nd Minute, legionnaires of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the MS
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken charge with a success of 4:0 the first stage for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) has equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed up speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy received the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment that the Estonian defence was able to prevent a possible goal of the -first scorer.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense of goaltender Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and clasped the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, intends to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Until 2015, about two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, said the Dax Group on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly," announced CEO Bill McDermott to its customers on an equitable basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from around 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the 176,000 global SAP customers are located in this rapidly expanding country.
China's growth plans are also an important part of the Dax Group's 2015 Strategy.

SAP has been active in China for more than 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"°Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
Personal mass slaughter
The new book by Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. Titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War", it begins with a long list of characters that will hold you to heart.
A tip to start with: carefully tear this page and make it your mark-up.
You will get to know these people in detail. In this romantic account of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mists of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote here an extraordinary book which he accurately describes as "an anti-history book."
It has some known names, important treaties or famous battles; almost no ambassador or discussion of strategies and material is found.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it might look like." It contains "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and grief" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, paramedics and vendors.
Some will become heroes.
Others of the prisoners of war, some of them will lose limbs, go crazy or lose their lives.
Their lives flicker here like the candles of a church: while some are extinguished, new ones are rekindled.
Peter Englund's book deviates from traditional history books.
It refutes the idea that World War I can only be summed up in the terrible trench war on the western front.
"Beauty and sorrow" cleverly describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under hives; one passes Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tsetse flies are an untraceable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that stinks of corditis.
When gunshots ring in the distance, and you are a mother in the house, do you stay or flee?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been compounded by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and sorrow" follows such individuals as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other previously published documents.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most deal with deprivation and the ability to cope.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on alternative food in Germany.
It describes "meat made of cooked rice crushed in sheep fat (and finished with a fake wooden bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; soles of wooden shoes."
He states that "837 authorized substitute meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories address honour and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards savagery and states about the war: "You feel that after all, that's what men were destined for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in their hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind your tweaked and studded shirt.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is at high risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to him.
"When one is resigned to sacrifice oneself, one hopes to have an audience," he writes.
Unfortunately, it is rather comparable to "a man convicted of strangulation in secret."
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming more and more a story of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He grasped the arrival of what he called "a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the mass murderer well articulated and ideologically convinced, in well-cut clothes, who executed his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviors as there is heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who at all costs tried to catch a venereal disease among prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"One finds the most grotesque expression in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread on the genitals in the hope of ending up in hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into a lifetime blindness."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but non ostentatious, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures the way in which the war "triggered forces that were exclusively uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are waging war against them.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "To the West nothing new", by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he came out of his book, grabbed with your hands that page with the list of people and burned with a match.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be most empty.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers as well as others who were informed from the beginning that they were going to undertake an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, with his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could not be repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, who went against the regulations of the department and generated a storm of public solidarity for the demonstrators.
The operation to clean up the Zuccotti Park of its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the course of occupation in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on the island of Randall, in preparation for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better anti-riot training - anti-terrorist measures to quickly move a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighbourhood.
The last training session took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders given to move around the park arrived "at the last minute", said a regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few policemen I know and who were called did not know that they would go to Zuccotti Park," said the person anonymously.
"The only ones who know they'd go there are at the top of the police department hierarchy."
The city learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, police officers wanted to clean up the park but were repulsed by hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the neighbourhood - dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal quarters.
Mr. Kelly said that many people went and came to the park during the day, like migrants, so one hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages ringing loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.
As community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their light blue windbreaks, many demonstrators simply gathered their belongings and left.
No tents were hit until 1:45 a.m. said the police, which allowed the occupants time to gather their belongings.
Other police teams were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the head of the police department, claimed that this action had been taken solely for security reasons.
But according to many journalists, the police reportedly prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, which was severely held by the officers.
Mr. Browne stated that the television camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved west through the thick business messes of the demonstrators, including luggage, plastic grass and bags of sheets filled with clothing, teams from the sanitation department followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged. The images were posted on the Internet shortly thereafter.
The main group of demonstrators took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the centre of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
About ten people at the epicentre of the camp hung on together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr.Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut the locks.
No arrests took place in the park until 3:30 a.m. said Mr. Kelly.
According to the police, the clean-up operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, close to 142 people were arrested in the park.
most of them for "disturbation of public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the most senior officer to have found himself at the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not lead the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, to the south.
We saw the police extend the perimeter far beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of whom were equipped with shields, were reportedly even seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the brightest actions of the night took place south of the park.
At approximately 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car. Others were seen breaking the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood came up flying from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protester were hospitalized.
School workers' union sues city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools housing disadvantaged schoolchildren.
The lawsuits are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, the 37th District Council, to try to have the dismissals overturned.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, co-ordinators of parents and other employees, who are among the city's least well-paid, lost their jobs on 7 October. Union leaders compared these dismissals to political revenge for not allowing the city access to a health care fund run by workers' groups, which would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this accusation.
At a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott stated that layoffs constituted part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council replied, stating that dismissals of school aids were not specified in any way in the budget.
Officers of the 37th District Council said they would fill out a notice of complaint, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce the lawsuits at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city's education department will be the respondent, and the complainants will be represented by eight dismissed female workers, all of black or Latin American origin, like most school assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the city's legal department, stated that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of dismissals in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighbourhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the southern Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed at Harlem State School 36, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the lawsuits claim that "It is not a neighbourhood of wealthy parents who can bring funds to fill the budget gap."
The budget of the public school 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each enrolment of disadvantaged students.
The union also claims that the directors of high schools may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorising the dismissal of coordinators of parents.
The memo used the term "exceedance" to describe the action, although "exceedance" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "Sixty-six parental coordinators were dismissed" and "not only because of overtaking".
Mission completed: Congress reaches agreement on Libya's issue
Finally, it would appear that the Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement in the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It took a successful uprising, the capture and death of the long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachussetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is about honouring the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It's bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not approving the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution to allow the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the financing of US operations in Libya.
The American mission therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress upset enough to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under its feet.
The indecision of Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the American armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also affirms "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win all the support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will it divide the legislators as last June?
Senator and Chair of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesperson said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, this week the House must vote an amendment to the Constitution to achieve a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but it is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of 68 constitutional amendments to be presented to Congress on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations from a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House of Commons only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that would "control federal spending."
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - in particular the new Republicans who wish to gloat their résumés - the chance to boast of being the "author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act approved last August called for the House and the Senate to vote on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators were voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of terms that Congress members can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to allow the annulment of federal laws if two thirds of states are opposed to them.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th Congress.
The pace slowed from the early 1990s when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacrée mais pas battée" says Gabrielle Giffords in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man shot him at close range in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on Monday night on a TV show, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted first to recover rather than go back to Congress.
When Gabrielle Giffords appeared on TV news "20/20" on ABC, alongside Diane Sawyer, she struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The show approached his difficult return after the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first TV interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, answered "rather well".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special one-hour edition of "20/20", aired the day before the release of the couple's new book entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special program has traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, we see her on her hospital bed, her shaved head and a wide scar on her forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sat in a wheelchair while doctors taught her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change her breakfast menu.
ABC's videos show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: one sees the Representative singing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
In the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours with the doctors every day, said she doesn't remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading an article about the shooting of 12 March when she stopped him and asked for the first time about the six people killed in the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated pending trial.
"There have been a lot of deaths," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said "I was beaten."
"So I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You were just massacred.
And you're gonna be okay, you're gonna get better and you're gonna be stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala in Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in a suit and tie stood at his feet to cheer him up.
"The military, both men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also with Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were presented as some kind of orphan," wrote the military high-grade in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have developed between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky minds."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not wish to appear unthankful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most conversations about pity take place confidentially among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the fight with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who were interviewing him were subtle in asking if he would be able to handle the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after he returned from combat.
"When you approach the subject of service, you are confronted with negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely praised by a country so unfamiliar with the army and which sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as in World War II," says retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people are largely focused on the depth of a soldier's suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of service periods, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The army in the face of increasing pressure to attack rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If so, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claims to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She returned to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked her if he could meet her in her room for a drink.
"It was an alarm signal," says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane has put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man grabbed her from behind, threw her on the floor and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and others not, will anxiously await a court decision at a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether a trial against former defence secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of not having stopped the widespread rape in the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the trial initially involved 17 plaintiffs, who were 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke claims to be attacking the gallooned soldiers, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals?
Counsel also states that since February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future legal proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of bringing all the complainants together in this case - thus putting all its eggs in the same basket - it will initiate several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The Defence team, for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. lawyer Neil MacBride, has tabled a motion to dismiss the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers on or off duty for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by staff on active duty.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the complainants' military service" indicate the documents.
The Department of Defense refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still have no official right to go to battle, this distinction is written only on paper: the front lines of the recent wars are rarely only male.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, particularly in reaching out to local women.
As a result of these two wars, 150 female soldiers lost their lives - two thirds in combat.
It's time for the army to modernize says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Center is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a trial against the army, focusing on diagnoses of "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
His group brought a lawsuit in December against the Veteran Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with requests for benefits for persons claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were registered according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defence.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, because according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of legal proceedings: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the army were the subject of a trial - half of the percentage of the civil judicial system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case describe their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 details of her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She was subjected to a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her attacker - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman was sitting before a judge at a trial where she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six persons testified as morality witnesses for the perpetrator, who eventually was acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down," said Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started yelling at the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commander, "It wasn't his trial but mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed under less than honourable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
Will the Lyman case and the other complainants move forward or not, it's a long story," says John Turley, professor of law at the University of Washington's Faculty of Law.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward".
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is found between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and deterrents of responsibility.
"The odds are heavy on them... but it's important that they try," he adds.
These things change only when the good ones have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favour, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other plaintiffs for further trials.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue until there is reform," she says.
Or until we die, either of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy sharing his anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having been taken from murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, talking to some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how can we find them?
Easy... Connect to Facebook.
"We realized it wasn't that difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they are looking for with scientific precision - the way the mercatists have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. It targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to answer a survey. The questions asked concerned their level of education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future.
By getting in touch with these people via Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"This is a new way of doing research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising at all: the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screen."
DEMOS's study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new essential tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all the topics that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to the "Like", wall publications and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, the "data supernova" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research works whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you could not approach on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to investigate people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You were supposed to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you in," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their intoxicated exploits were far more likely to be alcoholics than discreet students.
Megan Moreno suggested that student colleagues, such as counsellors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Children's Health, Behaviour and Development at the Seattle Research Institute for Children, says the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would otherwise not be recognized."
Facebook also has constant access to the information of its users.
The data team at the site studied statistics on the romantic situation and Valentine's Day, the turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and an index of national happiness (thanks to the information only available - the champions of digital freedom have for a long time maintained that the site could make available its data treasure to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometres away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation that they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information other than through the Internet, it is quite different online.
"I don't think many users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As long as they knew, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user's wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things," says Neil Selwyn.
That's why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notebook and a pen remain the best tools we can use.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social is not in front of a computer."
Cold and inhuman: first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance at the Oslo trial.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Norwegian Templars," he explains in front of a hearing room full of 500 people.
"As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I reject it because you hold your mandate as organizations that support an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought a speech on paper with him, talk to the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Justice Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, forbade him from speaking to the media for four weeks, and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others to make sure that he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found him cold and inhuman," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally advanced a little after seeing and hearing the suspect."
With a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked the journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the courthouse.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belonged to a broad "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The attacks of 22 July therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than of an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he didn't," said a relative of a victim.
"It would have been a lot easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the cinema this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by technical engineering and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recently discovered Steve Jobs interview that will be aired this week as the first part of a film in the major markets, is how much this creative spirit had understood the processes and workflow of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organizational chart improver - a man who believed that many business leaders were suffering from a "disease letting them think that a great idea does 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple for about 10 years. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aiming at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in transport.
It is only after Steve Jobs' death that a complete video is found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly upped, is the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be aired at the cinema on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism reappears, when he seems eager to hear the questions of Cringely, giving him elbows to speed him up and move on to questions or subjects of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strangely prescient aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision on the future of computing.
It's one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then implements them immediately.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
"All these years I've always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are constantly the same: 'oh, just because you have to do them.'"
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by providing details on his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how the costs were recorded - one often starts with a "standard cost" evaluated in sight, then adjusted with a "variation" - it has developed an automated factory that guaranteed the precise calculation of the commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack phone networks and phone for free in long distance.
The apparatus has been the subject of many writings in advance, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped the ball in different things half a dozen times and you were yelling in the public phone and it happened to you a minute later on the public phone next door," says Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We didn't both know much, but we made up a little thing that could control great things. That was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by pretending to be Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices left in a wild laugh just before the Pope himself was awakened.
On his love for technology (and the marketing of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and made a phone call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research labs, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode-ray tube, and I fell in love with him.
The teenager I was went back to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the Improvisation of Innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a whim.
At the beginning of his career, as he moved in to sell some printed circuit boards, a customer asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembly and delivery of the finished appliances.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big fights... they yelled at me pretending that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that turned out to be incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that are running out of steam:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders would be wrong and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, make a better copier or printer, and then what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [it is these types of people] who end up running companies and the specialized product staff are kept away from decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have made ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They tore the defeat from victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge piece of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
There are compromises to make... some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them together.
Finally, the decisions are made by personal taste. It is about trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists steal.
We're always ashamed of stealing great ideas.
This is in part what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who were simply the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with opponents of health law as the court meets
On the day when the Supreme Court meets in camera to examine the issue of political discord, namely whether opposition to President Obama's health law will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case before the High Court.
The event was held last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases concerned a trial by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental 5:30 am argument is expected next March, and the result will probably be likely to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be booming at the time the court's decision is rendered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue on the rejection of the law, will likely be Paul Clement, who served as Solicitor General of the United States during George W. Bush's administration.
Clément's law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen law firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-time group dedicated to upholding conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which presents a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among them was Mitch McConnell, the Senate's top Republican and a declared opponent of the health law.
The starred guests at dinner?
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may attend fund-raising organizations related to law and other matters although the judge cannot be an intervenor, a guest of honour, or appearing on the program of such an event".
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
"This ethical violation and superb indifference to the Code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and dined and at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event disassembles any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little respect for critics claiming that they too easily mix court business with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a conservative high profile activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was Solicitor General of the Obama administration when the first oppositions to the law were brought to the court of first instance.
His critics lobbied Kagan to recuse himself from hearing the case, saying that she had too much involvement in the defence of the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records record order of $18 billion for airliners
The Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777, two-couloir airliners, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated market of over $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order contemplating 50 of its products.
However, it is quite a matter when the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record amount of $18 billion.
Just as incredible is from whom Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that Middle East airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing informed of the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-couloirs.
It was the Emirates airline based in Dubai that placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the Dubai Air Show in 2011 that the airline is also likely to purchase an additional 20 aircraft, raising the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8s, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel and passenger convenience savings.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than $1 billion.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar analyst.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
They therefore have not only the means to pay for these aircraft, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them since the country would earn money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is important because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the price of oil increases, Dihora said.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
Emirates' order reinforces Boeing's predominance in the wholesale aircraft market and helps curb the attempt by the Airbus competitor to encroach on its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the Aeronautics Show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the start of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is pushing its start-up to increase its thrust in response to customers' demand to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
The shares of the Boeing company have increased by 1.5% to reach the 67.94 dollars.
The sister of the Mexican president clearly beaten in the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers helped her opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for governorship.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to become governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the top of the race for governor of that western state.
"The intervention of organised crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said on the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election agents... they seized the ballot boxes, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood out only a few times from Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before election day.
Calderon, candidate of his brother's Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the office of governor, has arrived third, a painful defeat before the presidential elections of 2012 for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any connection with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in trafficking in marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, violence persisted.
A week before the elections, a PAN mayor was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections seem, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man who is expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BADS urges Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro area emerge from the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Director General of the Manila-based BASD, said that the two fastest growing economic powers in the world must "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency area through the International Monetary Fund or through direct bilateral agreements.
He warned the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) not to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would help avoid a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We're all together in this crisis."
"Therefore anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but it is not safe."
"So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan has soared dangerously and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The booming sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that the global economy will return to recession, and has sparked the call of the major emerging economies to come together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag foresaw that the IMF would channel any Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - such as buying the bonds of the US Financial Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's Minister of Trade and Industry, said "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a depletion of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a choice, it's an imperative, because where would we find work for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich in Europe as they face their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get aid to Europe accepted by 1.2 billion Indians, at least 800,000 of whom live on $2 a day or less.
"One day they will discover that the Greeks are retiring at 50 years old and are going on vacation in the sun and they will have trouble swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the rail sector.
Mr Nag said that the euro area crisis could have "significant repercussions" across Asia.
BASD's forecasts of economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 now face "risks of loss" due to the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed "back-up plans" to protect themselves from economic overturning and large capital leaks.
Severe Pentagon Warnings on Potential Defense Reductions
Defence Secretary Leon Panetta pressured Congress on Monday, warning that impending automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. He triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields, including civilian rallies.
The Pentagon is already diging $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but is now concerned that an additional $600 or more cuts will be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in so-called sequestration would result in 23% reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
"Such a significant reduction, applied so indiscriminately, would make most of our ships and construction projects unexecutable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or vessel - and seriously undermine other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to part with a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly have to send civilians on unpaid leave in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
"Although wartime funding of foreign contingency accounts is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in core budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contracting staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and the supervision of contracts supporting the war."
"The staff managing the salaries would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
Both senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of sequestration on the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power."
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves."
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and should not have to happen."
Whether Panetta's letter and Senators' recent warnings increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, remains to be seen.
Panetta was increasingly virulent about possible cuts, even though he himself came to the top position of the Pentagon with years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what might happen - a soldier with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks to the Pentagon.
"It's a depressed force, poorly prepared and unable to face potential opponents."
"De facto, she invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could "generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limitations on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk assumed in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could go to coupret, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the next generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat vessel and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Putting an end to the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say this is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines shows how widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The administrators of Penn State were accused of perjury for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies have destroyed quarries and convulsed countries.
Congressman Anthony Weiner, a celebrity of the Internet, was an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with violations of campaign funding related to the coverage of an extramarital liaison.
And then, none of the people who lived the story will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton started by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating in school and university tests are legion.
There have been cases where teachers have given the test answers to students in order to get a good look at their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should teach the contrary send the message that lies and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or spotting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a social game similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to exclaim: "I've had you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research into such projects, notably in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been demystified.
The liars look you in the eye.
They do not stutter, blush or not always wave.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to expose.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, question formation and response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are able to read the others well, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "centered on them" while women say more lies "centered on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as an unbeliever, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you tell if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "establishing benchmark data."
This helps to provide a reference point for measuring future changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, the laughter, the vocal quality.
You need to know if someone normally moves his feet constantly so as not to make unfair accusations when you see him moving his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues of verbal and non-verbal misleading behaviour.
Consider these clues red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceiving people can immobilize the upper body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet at the door, lean towards an exit, change posture significantly or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions have passed.
Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is completed just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The well-known Scott Peterson skirmished using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Misleading individuals can also use a distanced language: "I have not had sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat entirely a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wooden language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the response perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be lost after the U.S. threat of late approval
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - sparking union anger while appease environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the proposed pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still gain its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogallala aquifer, large groundwater sources.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican at Fox News.
The re-examination of the environment commissioned by the State Department would probably have postponed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied the involvement of politics in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the State Department, and expressed his support for it.
The 2.735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do so, it would have to cross six states.
He is hated by ecologists, but loved by working groups, which have put money on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But the Nebraska legislators opposed this plan put pressure on a law to force the remoteness of the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current State Department Environmental Impact Statement found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Ministry's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A family in New York City says that the Disco Patti LaBelle diva, launched in an outburst of violence in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she vomited out of fear.
The tirade of the singer "Lady Marmalade" frightened little 18-month-old Geneviève Monk, to the point that she suffered "personal changes, sleep disorders" and "the increased fear of strangers," said her family during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 of last year when stage technician Kevin Monk, his kindergarten teacher wife, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down into the lobby of their building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in his arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter down for a while.
"Someone came behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went to get her," she said.
LaBelle angeredly admonished the pregnant woman.
"She said to me in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't leave your daughter by the door," says Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "What you say or think I'm not interested."
She became angry and started using swears - the word "" and the word "" in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started spraying me with water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself at the mother - who was still holding Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her entourage who dragged her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started throwing up, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note requesting an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
Counsel and LaBelle's representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, stated that he took the case for free and that the family is considering donating all the money received to a charity against cancer for children.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct," Davis said.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has curbed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment declined and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-called change, which generated great expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase does not occur, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, apart from causing trillion losses for the agricultural sector, limited the potential of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction in economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the Jelly Allocation Report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there was damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remainder of 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, maize and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity led, until November, to a steady increase in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of unemployment in the State during the first three quarters of the year was accelerated, because while from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a rate which represents more than 74 thousand Sinaloans unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we see is an increase in unemployment which is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who make dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work to earn them, to invest them and to use them in something," he says.
Detained migration
López Cervantes reported that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad in the United States has been limited, firstly because of entry difficulties and secondly because by entering they already have a lot of difficulty in finding work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which means that unemployment is rising," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the Sinaloan labour market is getting worse by considering the high level of lack of seriousness which predominates between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state works there without contributing as a worker at any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason of lag for the state are the low wages, the entity has the lower wages of the Country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecast.
The average monthly earnings of Sinaloan workers until September were 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average of 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contravention of FDI
Apart from the decrease of the economic activity and the increase of the unemployment, in 2011 the largest reduction of the Direct Foreign Investment of the last 10 years has been recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the State FDI has reached 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the Government of the State records a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by companies in the service sector.
Debt
In view of the economic contraction scenario, the Government of the State requested in July at the public congress the approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the objective of reviving the economy, the approval of the State congress was 2,600 trillion pesos and until November no debt benefit was observed in any sector of the State economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the employer sector, Mario López Valdés' first year of government demonstrates a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wishes of the different sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of Sinaloa's economy during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have had to align the effort of all and above all the good already synchronized march of this new government team, hope that next year is much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said that events like the frosts at the beginning of the year held the state economy back and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, between which the frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had," he says.
Redefining the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers' Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa has declared that the State is to be channeled towards productive activities of more dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that we detonate all the potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources," he says.
A lot to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that better channel the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to do," he says.
Sentenced for 8 kilos of marihuana
A person resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a fine of 100 days for possession of eight kilos of marihuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic has informed that the small dealer convicted is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for crimes against health, in his variant of possession of marihuana intended for sale.
In accordance with file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was travelling in a white pick-up truck in which he was carrying a black bag in the vehicle's luggage rack and in the co-pilot's place a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items were made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Enforcement Center for Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debts towards contributions to books
Social works contemplated in programmes such as Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrants may not be finished where there are serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that although construction programmes had so far progressed, they were in a situation of risk, as the Government of the State had not fulfilled its obligations to make contributions in excess of 11 million pesos in all three programmes.
He pointed out that in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, from which the State must provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipe have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their finalization.
"They have to make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end they have given us nothing, even if since July they had to give us part of it," he said, "and we, in order not to record any delays, we started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money".
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration Municipe had to apply for credit to cover the $7 million that the State administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already suffered this in the previous sexional period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to work and this year, in order to be able to access these programs, we had to get the resources to cover what the state had not paid for," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the State authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the managements so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have given us nothing."
Court validates "analog cut-off" in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has rejected the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogue cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be followed in order to achieve the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was rejected for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because the regulation of radio and television is a statutory allocation to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), contrary to the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies in order to contest the decree and admit complaints, the Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions planned by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of ministers also resolved to dismiss the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister President said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures so that the public administration prepares for it.
"I also consider that it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, whose constitutional mandate is the management of the state.
The substitution of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most significant changes the world has experienced in recent years and this translates into better radio spectrum exploitation, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the change, he argued, would postpone the benefits of digitalization, which involves a public interest decision that has not only a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he stressed, “require the operation of an entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a group of functions which the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State”.
He recalled that a large number of countries from all over the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, has invaded in a form the sphere of competence of the Congress, for it ensures in the administrative sphere the respect of the laws issued by the Legislative, assured it.
The possibility of a vote-by-vote count in Michoacán is analysed.
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on the past 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal reform in electoral matters.
It will be recalled that Michoacán did not approve either its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Act, at the same time as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for the entry into force of this electoral process was completed and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the time limits provided for by the Law of the State Official Journal, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same 9th of November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the agent of the state for constitutional reforms, because he does not have the right to "sanction or contest".
Interviewed about the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that with the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to make partial and total counts of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there are no voting minutes and counting in the ballot box file is not in the chair of the ballot box; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the votes received in all the ballot boxes of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the candidate who is supposed to win the respective election and the candidate who obtained the second place in the election is equal to or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the representative of the party and/or coalition that submitted the second of the candidates reported.
The total count of the election can also be carried out if, at the end of the joint count, the difference between the candidate who is supposed to win and the candidate who is second is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is an express petition from the representative of the political party whose candidate is second, in which case the electoral packages which have been the subject of the partial count will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the Morelia election, where according to the PREP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
Its ashes will be spread in the Sierra Zapalinamé, confirms the family.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday around night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a requiem misse.
According to his family, the lieutenant-colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be spread in the Zapalinamé Sierra.
After receiving the tributes alongside the other people who died in the accident, Bacio Cortés' family returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Forces, the closest of them attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant-colonel arrived at the vigil chapel of Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends went.
At 5:30 p.m., he was presented with tributes to the Saltillo Technological Institute organized by his former Bachelor of Technology colleagues and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was a member when he was preparing for the Bachelor's degree.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and that his ashes were spread in the Zapalinamé Sierra, he always said that to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, she considered that he was in the fullness of his life, "he had success, he was a father and son, extraordinary, an affectionate brother and was very caring for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés abandoned the city of Saltillo at a very young age to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it, because they said he even had a lorry pain; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as this was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for his relative's graduation, for that reason he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
His Last Farewell
With honours we have said good-bye to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, who was the head of Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Saltillo Technological Institute, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself both in studies and in sport.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was piloting crashed, next to the Secretary of Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and other six people, all officials of this service.
The remains of the Bacio Cortés pilot born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 hours to be handed over by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the esplanade of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and his other parents, students and teachers.
Three abandoned corpses, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found shot and killed in different parts of the body and with the coup de grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at km 1.5 of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
A few people who went through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has beige color and coffee the gate was wide open.
Looking inside, approximately three metres away, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; on his side there was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
A meter away there was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying on the belly.
According to in situ data, the three people had been murdered in another location because in situ casings were not found.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by a group of organized delinquency towards the other, apart from some orifices of bullet in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence made the presentation of 11 persons, among whom a minor, who formed part of a criminal group which operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and which are considered to have relation to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to the information published, in a first incident on 11 November in the Los Alveros settlement, eight people were arrested and one who had been deprived of liberty was saved.
They were confiscated three buildings and one cell phone; they claimed to be part of the criminal group known as "Los Zetas".
In another event that took place on 12 November at 06:00 hours, military personnel made a surveillance tour at Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, by detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
By stopping them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a magazine and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on 13 November at 14:00 hours one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape seeing the military.
They are attributed clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has endangered the whole Eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he can form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in his majority by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will assume his position.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his conversations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for Journalists.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "frame is now well drawn," he added.
Monti completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy fought a political and financial crisis that pushed the costs of its debt to levels impossible to sustain.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the yield of the Italian bonds BTP at 10 years above the 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much".
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's potential for success was greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told the press.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed Monti's technocrat majority government.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations.
He'll finish his meeting tour Tuesday through the night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who empowered an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for Eurozone's current financial defences.
Monti said his Government should persist until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before advancing the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it must be formed only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of Spanish people is superior to that of Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convoked participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, compared to the 22 convened by the two countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 pm, at the National Stadium of San José.
While the national and European champions, the number one in FIFA's monthly rankings, record a large register of class A inter-selection games, the Habs only has defenseman Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the First League of England, maintain an intense year-round activity in league championships and national Cups and fights in European Cups like the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated playoffs of the European Cup and the World Football.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the biggest record of the Spanish Selection is that of goaltender Íker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equalled the record of former goaltender Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the Habs and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's brainfly, is 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the front center of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Ready of the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the scorer Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have exceeded the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not start yet.
The historical scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto a includes the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
""Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream come true to happen in this country.
It is that bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of its tour celebrating two decades of work and Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
On that day they will arrive at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles The X group and the Las Robertas Nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcription of which can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been grandiose.
I spent only one vacation in Costa Rica; it is such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So we are moved to carry our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensely the previous days.
What is your message to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us for all these years.
It took 21 years for us to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to pass until this concert.
Some people already say his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit.
Some of the larger shows that we have offered in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We have offered two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that it has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to it.
We love this country, we like surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learned, through the people who love surfing.
When you see the tour, you offer huge shows, with lots of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never been there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to do the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to perform two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the directory.
What is that supposed to mean?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can perform more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, which is why it's very difficult to choose which songs to perform each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played in a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we love these songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting to us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting to people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don't think either of us had imagined that we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together is very exciting to us.
We love each other and love to create music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to form part of this group of major groups.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement emerges from a group of friends and is unusual.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to be part of the Seattle band.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we took part in a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to be friends with all of them again and it's an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It is also very strange that a group like yours keeps itself united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally last.
First, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive and, second, we are all concerned about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give freedom to everyone to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and that could not be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great multitudes and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect the music and what brought it, without putting in mind the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which doesn't really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and we didn't publish a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There have been a lot of frustrations about the fact that it lasted so little and most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think about the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it has always been a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose him for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and this one was the band we liked the most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very entertaining.
What do you always change the lyrics of Yello Ledbetter live for?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bass player, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first ones I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep up the grunge despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the bands that came up at the same time and, if that's relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now doing the best music ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that look lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even though they may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose to a parent or friend, these things start to influence your art and music and these songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even so we can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former president Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he presents in the magpies, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a sentence of 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000) suffers from various conditions, including a language cancer for which he has been operated four times and which is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, said for Canal N of television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days in the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and the loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the remission of sentence for humanitarian reasons, no doubt he said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times on tongue cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the feet, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving prison sentences since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the Police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of various ministers and bosses, will launch this Tuesday a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two nations and address political themes of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with political and commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be "propice for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its web page.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when the French representative, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a declaration that led to the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations by his ambassador from that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group made up of the world's strongest emerging and developed countries, and has, since January this year, been in force with the South American country to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 'grey list', integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of tax co-operation.
On the trade front, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu plumber moves to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the wicked Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young one in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at stores all over the world, was designed from the beginning to make good use of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who must say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for this medium", because so far hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a fast and smooth game.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most expert will be able to do a "second round" at game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "don't succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion by Super Mario into the three dimensions also presupposes the return of the character to a mobile console, a fact that was no longer happening since 2005.
In these Nintendo video games makes a nod to the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of success of previous games, which consists in the fact that the moustachu plumber has to travel platforms mined of peril to release Princess Peach.
Even though I find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in Luigi's "playable" cases.
Colom approves Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of 70 million US dollars.
Thus, the trial ends in order for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country for Portillo to try him there.
In a press conference, Colom claimed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and he had given way to all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done presupposes an executive approach after exhausting all judicial and constitutional proceedings to try the former 2004-2004 proxy.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and after having guaranteed his human rights.
Portillo was absolute for misappropriation of funds of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the Public Prosecutor appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The stocktaking of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter century.
To this is added the long centenary of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats that more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the objective of helping people with little training, without work, with problems of drug addiction or marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of heads of entities and institutions who in these 25 years collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the election season, showed the unitary character of Trinijove's work.
Next to the president of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former socialist minister of education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor to the mayor and current eco-socialist councilor Ricard Goma.
The present Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the general director of charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa were also present in the large hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president gave Trinijove as an example to fight the wrong circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-festivals, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the building's 13 apartments in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of 51 Balmes Street were living has come to an end.
Twelve people left the building they were illegally occupying at noon yesterday voluntarily and organised micro-festivals that despaired of the neighbours, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent a repetition of the situation.
"From this day on there will be access control," said the administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the building's 13 apartments - the rest were inhabited - carried away the electrical installation and part of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass festivals, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained for Europa Press that from the time the building was occupied its business fell a 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property gave him unfair jurisdiction, because they sold the drinks at three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreation room had to respond to the neighbours' complaints about the noise, while, according to her, the troubles were not caused by the clients of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties held there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irritated neighbours of the area.
The head of the disco explained that the troubles were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since the owner "forgives" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours about this situation.
Last week, Alberto Fernández Díaz, president of the municipal group of the PP of the town hall, called for "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of communal life and civicism that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were also thefts.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must end with impunity and be relentless against the antisocial behaviour generated in the property".
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police moved to number 35 of Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide on the advisability of the convocation beyond the controversy on fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed promotional posters from Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a numerical comparison with Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not focus on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park except Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a mega-competition composed by 16 contests for all access doors to Collserola.
A door brings back the idea of a park, without a doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appears on its own: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organisation and with regard to the reflection on the city is a topic of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona.
This is almost a recurring theme that two members of this former caste of elected officials talk about when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, came together.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on the "mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the green blocks was not completed.
"It is necessary to start from the base that the wider park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", the architect gave the verdict for which the title of "Doors of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": these should not be thought of "like access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some perils".
Perils that derive from the "uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after the experience lived in the '80s and which had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the own delimitation of the boundaries on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already setting the next step", that is, its exceedance.
"We have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM) ] can cause genuine disasters".
By sticking more to the question, Modol opines than, by simplifying, the slope of the region El Valles de Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronate of Collserola that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers to its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe-conduct that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "doubt" if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a success story", he says) that we had to create: "We architects should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question which gives the title of this piece is complex, because from the bases of the contest there is a lack of an overall vision of Collserola: "We have convened 16 transversal competitions - he says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least in this case, that he chose to participate in all 16 competitions.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In its opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the band immediately superior to that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that makes a gentle transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal proxy of Casino Red granted pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founder of Casino Red's legal power grants him forgiveness before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which is following a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jonás demanded payment of an economic quotte for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the underground operation of the gambling house.
Following the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the mayor of the Panist and on 2 September the latter was arrested and held under provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Prosecutor's Officer 3 of Patrimony Offences, he was transferred to Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when a second detention order was issued after the Public Prosecutor's Office officer had dismissed corruption and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the criminal centre in Cadereyta allegedly for blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the medium security detention centre because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October an order for capture was issued by the Registrar of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonás' guilt, such as that relating to the receipt of 1.5 million pesos from representatives of the gambling house in exchange for its operation.
This Monday, the founder of the legal power of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could regain his freedom within the following hours.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's Officer attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who had been the one who granted the pardon from the partners of the gambling house, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
According to file 197/2011 the legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and subsequently no claim can be made regarding the trial against him; no compensation or punishment will be sought.
After the hearing of the lawyer of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The court clerk, Jorge Yánez, went to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also inform him of the immediate order of freedom issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake and other seven people lost his life
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) informed that the results revealed on the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people, lost his life, indicate that the helicopter directly shocked against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that prior to the aircraft's take-off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate for flying.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage".
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so the unit met the necessary requirements to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that investigations conducted in the impact area did not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a search it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact was structurally presented.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The soil had a pant of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the secretary has assured us that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, General Manager of Airports and Auxiliaries Services assured that the moment of impact, the State Major Presidential helicopter was operating in cruise speed and it happened on a soft rising ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruiser operation at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, the SCT holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual theft:
According to aviation regulations, the flight was conducted according to visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM indicated adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft advanced to the border area between DF and the State of Mexico, there were layers of low-level cloud.
Selected routes:
It is likely that, due to the cloud conditions, the crew searched for a lower height area and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the aircraft's last recording on the radar coincide, probably before impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight and lateral path.
The aircraft's residual dispersion model assumes that the helicopter struck the ground under structural integrity conditions.
Traces of fire or explosion were not detected:
At the disaster site there is still no trace in the aircraft remains of any type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the fieldwork, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9,200 feet above average sea level, and the ground had a slope that has been going from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides evidence that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful search in a wider area than the surrounding area around the accident, scattered aircraft parts were not found, which supports the presumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find the obesity gene
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the obesity gene for children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is leading an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people, called the 'Genetics of Obesity of Children and Adolescents' protocol that will allow to have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Investigation Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialities of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Investigation and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the Institut Polytechnique National (IPN).
The investigation invites the population who are entitled or not to participate, to present themselves to the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the evidence is carried out to the minors every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
It has emphasized that the protocol has begun in the Sports Unit Cuauhtemoc (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity takes place in the Sports Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sportive Independencia Unit (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sportive Morelos Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that of knowing the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As will be celebrated on November 14th on World Diabetes Day, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires relating to diet.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their history of family inheritance from their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels, and genetics will be applied to all participants (people associated with childhood obesity are being identified).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarmant weight gain in the case of minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in only six years there was an increase in obesity among boys in 77 per cent and in overweight among girls in 47 per cent; there was also a dramatic increase in overweight among boys,' the IMSS specialist stressed.
He indicated that the rationale for finding markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others in its genetic history.
He informed that on average, Mexicans have a 65 percent Indo-American heredity, a 30 percent European and a five percent African and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn excess energy that is consumed (calories), which is deposited as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the participants is the full assessment of children, which makes it possible to detect if they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark-coloured folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the probability of suffering metabolic and even pre-diabetes alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, with physicians providing it in writing to parents, explaining each of the measures and lifestyle changes they need to implement to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking over short distances.
Another cause is the high calorie intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - meat pie with corn flour wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid blackcurrant
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better efficiency, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the reports that the pavement was resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand Cassis each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the asphalt pavement is adequate, the Cassis could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A Technological Opinion on Cassis, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture having characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera considered that this type of modified asphalt could be used in areas where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve yield, and therefore the formation of blackcurrant.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a lower molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, of almost 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the majority of the streets of Ciudad de México were covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it by generating effort, it allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, these would spread better, opinating the chemical ingenious.
On the asphalt layer, he says, one puts a last layer called a rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the forces, the bearing layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, because these significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes blackcurrant.
In the process of forming a blackcurrant, he says, the first one that spoils is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Researcher System explained that vehicle load is another important factor for the formation of blackcurrant and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be linked to the load of vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent formation of blackcurrant.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and make it possible to repair blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that made Melina Ramírez Serna not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle gets her princess title number 14.
Once again Valle del Cauca stayed with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico has mounted with the crown and the sceptre, the department already sums up 14 titles of Princess and Melina one to a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who have found themselves near the crown but have been proclaimed princesses, among which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many people are asking is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Pretty Face of Vogue, titles obtained by queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who won the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the juror's decision to appoint her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What was the book that marked you and why? posed by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer of the candidate for Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it is a form of culturalization, definitely I believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it is a rather deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Ardor of Blood".
This response did not please, first of all, because of the term "culturalization" and secondly to not explain in concrete terms how each book cited had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt quiet and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what must happen.
And for everyone, please read, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Between the hypotheses made there is the one according to which Valle was destroyed by favouritism.
A journalist from Bogota insinuated that being the favourite, the ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (the challenge of gastronomy Oster, the public vote for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), "this awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on the stage".
And that was noted in his first presentation in a swimsuit at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Although at both parades she seemed confident of herself, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" (As at home) program, of the RCN Canal said that the fact that Melina had been designated princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who obtains most of the prizes during the competition does not receive the queen's crown".
In addition, Valle avoided the press in the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of its interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That's why two days before the election international juror Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to her country's social needs.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the Competition are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by her flaws in her buttocks and fibrosis that was observed in her abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected her as the candidate 'Natural beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there was better, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too notorious, left her points on the last day".
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the candidate of Valle was the surgery she had undergone.
"Surgeries are good, but Valle couldn't do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of that aspect."
For this prize, which the National Beauty Contest presents for the first time, after the swimsuit show emerged a cruel prediction that came true last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina so as not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will pass into history as one of the queens who despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
Thus was the work of Cali's person who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A typist from Cali went to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
The past November 4 a typist of the CTI of Cali has passed to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme chief of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", by confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists who work in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was the turn of "availability" of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has worked for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to arrive at the place where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after taking appropriate courses, he specialized in typoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano Eliazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be the man who was directing the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take away the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the body, he did not recognize it by its physical aspect, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a pre-electurer and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme leader of the Farc.
Looking for the fingerprint
For a typist from Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made in Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Typhoscopy is an exact science, without margin of error, that can be crucial in solving crimes.
Apart from identifying corpses, typists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured.
When captured, many offenders present false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher told the story that in one case of theft he had to remove a part of a wall from a house, because in that place the thief had pressed his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate areas to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint with the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in different robberies," he recalls.
Fingerprints can also rule out or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
By way of investigation, it was determined that a relative may be suspected of the crime and indeed a print on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee he's the killer, it puts him at the crime scene.
An ITC typist explained that "fingerprints are extracted from objects with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a pre-releaser or tape is used to collect them.
Later, the prints are sent to Asif, the database of the declines, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," the ITC expert pointed out.
He explained that not everything is how one shows in the CSI television program.
As everything that shines is not gold, everything that is touched does not necessarily become a footprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The "indignants" defy the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators were rushing in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large proportion of the people agreed to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The Occupy Wall Street supporters challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to enter again, thanks to a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators were rushing in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a judicial order that allows the 'indignants' to camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," says one of the spokespersons of the "Occupe Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the 'indignant' response to the evacuation of their camp dictated personally by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, arrived at the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignants' occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and Jersey, owned by Trinity Church Parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some demonstrators, even though Bray could not confirm the actual figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are centenaries of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of the members of the movement and tried to intervene in favour of them in front of the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a private property compound - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled by this Tuesday during which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators who had been displaced were carrying and distributing copies of this judicial order at that time, and they even handed it over to the agents who were watching the square, which caused 'some small clashes', said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials hit the demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of Occupy Wall Street or from enforcing 'laws published after the beginning of the occupation or prohibiting demonstrators from re-entering the park with tents or other properties they used previously'.
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and demonstrators, but warned that local laws did not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal councillor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn in Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and decided because the demonstrators were 'in violation of the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the square to be evacuated because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases to harm others", because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"This morning's evacuation at dawn was repugnant and shows that deep down Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers," added the movement's spokesman, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression."
"Occupe Wall Street" officials also indicated that they do not intend to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV program
Next to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be released on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescuer in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program on Canadian television.
The CTV private television channel today announced that Anderson, next to the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on the next December 1 performing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide dissemination on the Internet of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed like the Virgin Mary by supporting in a crib a doll that represents to Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian actor of Indian origin who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appeared as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Christmas program also features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from the controversies.
Recently, Bublé called American "Pute" Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP rose 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ended the downward spiral of early March
Since March, Japan's economy has been paralysed, recovering from the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe in Japan since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo Government calculated the material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September were used to permanently turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% in annualized rates.
That recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - assumes, in addition, the greatest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
Part of the recovery is due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the post-tsunami.
In fact, the companies have increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the decrease of 0.9% of capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decrease after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - the infrastructures, to use the deficiencies to grow from zero.
Japan has woken up mainly due to changes in domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by higher spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refugia values" elected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the Eurozone and the forecast turmoil of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their low results between July and September for the yen's contribution.
While the markets continue to have their headquarters in the peripheral EU countries, Yoshihiko Noda's government does not drop the guard.
"We must monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) mentioned that the majority of member countries presented clearer signals of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are being held back.
Because it has dropped four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is in level 100, n lowering eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens Feeds Back Doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to be entangled in the maze that leads to the end of the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new transitional government in Hell is imposed rather by the demands of Brussels than by a real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, reported yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days established in his designation may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the date planned, that of 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October," Papadimos said when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras No's message casts doubt on his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have committed ourselves to nothing more."
The conservative leader has gone a step further in his pulse than EU and IMF, the agencies that must release the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to implement the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the va-tout of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will only release the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellen parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there is no definitive date either.
Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasises the "preponderant" position of Spain with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant place at world level in the role of Microfinances".
Queen Sofía recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the world's second largest donor in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very especially, in that which aims to reduce to half the volume of people living on incomes under one dollar a day, to which is set the "threshold of poverty".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in every corner of the world, and takes on this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and the original contributions during the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "achieved many goals" and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to push "two basic goals".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are going beyond the poverty line in which they now live.
The impulse in the conception of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she has known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to know on the ground her lending policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution", explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the qualifier of "head of family" gathered in Valladolid from the "banker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofía ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Etiquetic imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, she explained that it would be a mistake to vinculate cooperation with developing countries at times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits presuppose "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to "excluded people to whom all close the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed people present in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday 14 November in Leipzig, took place without any real difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned for in the programme but was imposed in the autumn, especially to satisfy the activists who consider the government's policy too lax vis-à-vis the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which Angela Merkel and then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, were entitled, at the end of their speeches, did not leave room for doubt.
The mastery of the Chancellor's idea - and of the motion - is based on a slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could lead to amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union over the fiscal policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give a face to Europe".
This is, in any case, one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, the inspiration of which is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Sevens will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is also hostile.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the Executive Board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which obviously amounted to strengthening the weight of Germany.
In an effort to calm the climate within her party, the Chancellor multiplied references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she also did not seek to win her congress on the back of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty who were quick to criticize the arrogant Germany.
While the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in hollows.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does sickness arrest fraud mean?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on sick stoppages.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund, and deliver a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less announcing an axis of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority wants to focus on sick stops.
First of all, with a view to saving the budget: the government plans to impose a fourth day of default on employees in the private sector before taking over a stoppage of work.
Clearly, without a specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days' pay, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could provoke anger, but which would yield 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic in scope: to impose on civil servants a day of non-compensated deficiency in the event of a stoppage of work (they have so far no waiting period, compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority are also reviving the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses linked to work stoppages.
"The controls will be much more important and, if you are taken, you will pay back," warned Xavier Bertrand at RTL's microphone on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the publicity effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of work stoppage fraud.
This has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, most of which have borne fruit.
The French are no more ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than €237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances in 2008 accounted for 5% of health expenditure, with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% concerned sick leave, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
And so 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French had an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting.
An average that hides some discrepancies: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management website Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had taken no sick days.
Another study, this time from Health Insurance , states that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was for less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more likely than elsewhere to stop working.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) in France varied between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud on sick leave represents very little in the face of undeclared work.
As far as fraud is concerned, it is only a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that checks are systematic on sick stoppages of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term stops were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of detentions of more than 45 days, systematically checked, 11% of 1.2 million, or 132 000, were "unsuitable or unjustified".
In total, 169,000 "unjustified" cases out of several million employees who have had a sickness stoppage.
A figure which represents very little in comparison, for example, to that of work in the dark.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would amount to 9 to 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus infinitely more than fraud against them.
Papadémos: Greece to implement new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to restore its economy.
That is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said to Parliament on Monday 14 November, adding that the 100 days given to his unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue efforts to restore the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr Papadémos predicted that the country's public deficit would be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after having been 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects New Austerity Measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, on Monday supported the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with the deputies of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and the debt, and of combating waste, but opposed to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says a committee of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
With respect to palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in the denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements for that.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts in a variety of fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, with a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the outset, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, report the experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Across the country, Quebec has the highest rate, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to the experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on non-competent or non-consensual persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, said yesterday in a teleconference, there would be more cases of these outbursts precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in Support of Euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid poll.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
As for those involved in assisted suicide, respondents estimate that 41% should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or ceasing care with a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Expert Panel also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
With respect to palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer.
Finally, with respect to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee asks that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations by other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada Expert Report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described the position of the experts who signed the report as "extreme", among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to the terminally ill.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old could ask for help to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who had consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
Mr. Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the individual's autonomy above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
"In society," he says, "there are beacons and constraints."
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she described as "pro-euthanasia demonstration".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is particularly challenging the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Bashar al-Assad's Syria, which, with Russia's support, resists them and denounces a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League suspended Syria, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took a stand in favour of President Assad's departure.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces were still killed.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, deplored the failure of the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country towards which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough line.
For its part, the United States welcomed a "strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime", following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces perished in the Dar'a region of southern Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians perished "on exchanges of fire and shelling with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said that the country was "directing towards the end of the crisis".
He also reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said constituted a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not bow," he added, assuring that "conspiracies against Syria will fail."
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he believes is locked in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the plan to end the crisis decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities in dispute and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday found the decision of the Arab League "uncorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the plan to end the crisis, while refraining from supporting any sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time from the markets and sacrifices from the Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, demanded a little time from the markets to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting the trade unions and employers today.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with great sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting the President-designate.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to seek a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a short list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are specific deadlines" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying "somewhat markets will be patient and understand".
Its appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern has taken over in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should set up a team with mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "policies".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislation, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti undertook, once he had taken office, to work urgently and with the aim of "re-establishing Italy as a protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of a balanced budget in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, called for further austerity measures.
The Italian "patron of bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot respect the parameters of deficit".
Mr Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "period change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "teacher" symbolising "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place 200 billion euros in state bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-usable detonator, said an American nuclear-risk NGO on Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) draws on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
Last week the IAEA expressed its "serious concerns" about a "possibly military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, drawing heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk, Urals, and was allegedly involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then allegedly cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA refers to "strong indications that Iran's development of a nuclear detonation system" was assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who was not only familiar with this technique, but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked for most of his career on this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Anti-Muslim crimes and offences increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or little, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49%, compared to a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and an overall 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and offences.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes rise again," stressed the human rights organisation Human rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organisation added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be seen as a serious violation of human rights," adds Paul Legendre, head of the organization.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses," he added, believing that this could be achieved through improved police reporting on "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the time of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin colour, religion, origin and now sexual belonging.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter micro-blogging site introduced changes on Monday in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allow you to follow more legibly, live the activity of the other "Twittos", the users whose messages are followed ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows you to know if they are forwarding messages, subscribing to new accounts, having favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter format was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, told AFP Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its somewhat instinctive functioning, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to redifuse a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the insiders happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of Facebook and Google+ mainstream networks.
On the network, users were discussing the relevance of this innovation with the use of "tweets".
"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed," sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
inclusion of a budgetary "golden rule" in the constitution
On Tuesday, the government of the major ruling Social Democratic/Christian Democrat coalition in Austria decided to include in the constitution a budget "golden rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible degradation by rating agencies of Austria's sovereign rating (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision at the end of a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt was 74.6%, well above the 60% maximum laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced by only one notch, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros in additional interest each year," argued Vice Chancellor and Christian Democrat Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus following up on a request from the Brussels summit of the euro area member countries on 26 October last: the Heads of State and Government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The system adopted by the Austrian Government is closer to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, as of 2017, the federal government's structural government deficit will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to bring public debt up to 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen strong
Noda threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would again intervene in the foreign exchange market should the yen continue to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Mr.Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen went up not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just set a new record of strength since 1945 against the green note.
But the yen has been steadily rising since then, boosted by purchases from investors who consider it a "refugee value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar went back Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen bar, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro over 160 yen.
This surge in the Japanese currency is affecting exports to Japan as it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of foreign income by Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), stressed Mr Noda who fears that this increase in the yen will kill the fragile recovery in the bud.
The third world economic power returned to growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of households led by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considered that the high price of the yen did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", suggesting that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (€47 billion), raising the ceiling on the amount it spends on purchases of various financial securities to 55,000 billion yen (€519 billion) to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
rates go up, stock exchanges go down.
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weaker countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro area, the European stock exchanges are sinking a little more into negative territory, this Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt yields 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With new tensions on the yields of euro area countries in difficulty, equity markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down by 0.7%, suffering in turn from renewed fears from market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a corridor of narrow variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it declined after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion providing in particular for the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian bonds at 10 years old reached 6.85%, that of Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the speakers.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has demanded time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain finds itself in the line of focus of the markets, while Sunday's parliamentary elections in the country are held.
The spread gap between Germany and Spain's 10-year bonds reached a new historical high.
Pending euro area growth figures
On the statistical side, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected, driven by household consumption.
However, INSEE revised the figure for the second quarter downwards, with a decrease of 0.1% in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And, it is really the fourth that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is one subject which cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy that an election should be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and on the place nuclear power holds.
The debate will be fruitful only if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic change will lead to a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to compensate for the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity permanently, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a subject that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case for Belgium, which is subjecting its own to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor for Switzerland, which just intends to build only last generation power plants.
On the other hand, the Czech Republic, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, are pursuing their projects with determination.
The United States, on the other hand, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their fleet by resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
While the German model, which focuses on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, reality upsets the discourse.
Berlin's choice will result in higher electricity prices, increased energy dependence and increased use of imported gas, especially from Russia, a surge in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal-fired power plants.
Within a few months, all these unfortunate effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is to be considered.
Europe's wind champion, from which he derives 30% of his electricity, he is also one of the biggest users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of the wind; by virtue of which his CO2 emissions and the price of his electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction on the part of nuclear power would lead to a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make illusory the fine declarations on the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not object in principle to this energy, the polls show.
Recall that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Highly export-oriented, it leads to a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and makes them very creative of non-localizable jobs.
If France were to decide to leave nuclear power, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the annual 6 billion euros of French exports of nuclear equipment and services as a source of grief.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years when the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no miracle source of electricity generation, nor is there any evil.
The development by Areva of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a Safety Authority which exercises intransigent and transparent control over existing power plants as well as the Flamanville yard.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession of safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, operated under normal operating conditions, with no human or environmental consequences.
At Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did for the previous two.
As a result of this approach and of cooperation between the safety authorities, the operators and the French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians who want to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by giving them the free way to seize the leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotion, dogma and partisan maneuvers to dominate such a decisive debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - congestion of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the number, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "countries of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has come to light, with the Minister of the Interior (read Libération of 23 May) proclaiming that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant servers".
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a fairly broad consensus on this subject between the left and the right.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million migrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared to the left as well as to the right.
For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be given to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to trivialities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be paid for electorally; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book synthesizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among scholars on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration anemia growth and harming employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they are likely to replace national workers, especially the low-skilled, who are putting downward pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mainly engaged in trades in sectors in need of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national wage earners, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors in which training does not follow the job supply.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri has thus calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows leads to an increase between 0.6 and 0.9% in real long-term wages.
And this does not take into account the fact that the diversity provided by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, averaging 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenue less expenditure) of EUR 150000 to public budgets on average over the whole of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of the mandate, to look for the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, as a deterrent to immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, European democracy remains to be thought of
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would be enough for democracy to triumph over its enemies definitively, to vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way possible.
We know, from Napoleon "le Petit", that this was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become an "instrument of oppression" as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, education, Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just as much, and first and foremost, a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum has in this respect had the value of double revealing: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought of in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic struggle have now moved, and that, for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized on the basis of necessity and in dispersed order.
A blank-seing with the absolute European monarch or a joint jump in the void of nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cuts, but we want a common exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level, of full right, serene and continuous.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - there is no point in stopping the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bends to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
There is concern about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the leadership of the European project.
For it is together that Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The end of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After a long time of fighting this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for the European economic government.
All right.
But to think of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take on a new stage in the construction of Europe.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" republicans.
The Revolution in interest could not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, a genuine European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
Contactless smart cards are becoming more widespread
The global smart card show opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, SIM phone...), to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transport or pay for your purchases by simply approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and to represent almost 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Long behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa credit cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the big surfaces put double bites.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To move up the speed, banks must now equip their customers.
"Two major French establishments have committed themselves to systematically distributing to their customers bank cards equipped for contactless customers in the future," said Gérard Nébouy, General Manager of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology needed to perform transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should finally see a real boom next year."
"We are counting on selling 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a contactless payment case.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale, too, said yesterday preparing for the placing on the market of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front spreads
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-sustained links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are being confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
"The way in which the two organisations operate and the reports from the intelligence services show that there is good cooperation," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January reportedly uncovered bridges.
Kidnapped in a Niamey restaurant by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of past calls refers to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who spent a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who claims to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we probably have to wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" had been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourse of Boko Haram or in his modus operandi, which now involve the use of increasingly complex suicide bombers or explosive devices and on the same bill as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of uninteresting illuminants.
Rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haoussa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict respect for sharia law while its activists engage in the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are aimed primarily at churches, bars and administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army's taking over the city, 800 people are dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, was killed in prison.
From then on the sect will radicalize and leave its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and another in Abuja.
In June, it was again in Abuja that Boko Haram attacked the secure police headquarters during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria is now a matter of concern to all security professionals.
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, as Somalis in al-Shebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, in a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was "ready to share all the information."
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete with simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
Over the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have multiplied the powerful statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a republican strength.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often unsubstantiated - are coming out.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese to the WTO and question them "for the manipulation of their currency", a theme that carries in an America exasperated by the migration of whole parts of its industry to Asia.
So much the worse if this should involve the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's ex-ambassador in China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost strangled in the face of an attitude that "flame" emotions.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the soundings, remains inaudible.
Like Reagan.
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll get the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called for countering China's military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop a nuclear capability" - apparently ignoring the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the US army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The current president's opponents argue that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his anti-terrorism wine.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, on his procrastination in Libya, thus sticking a label of weakness to him.
But the attack isn't that easy.
Obama's national security record, which eliminated bin Laden, is considered by the population to be quite positive.
From Iraq, it is wary of military interventions that lead to engulfment.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to revive its leadership, Obama strikes more just.
Nord Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, directly linking Western Europe and Russia through the Baltic Sea, has entered into service.
It must supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brilliance.
More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine buffet, at the inauguration of the Nord Stream, this new pipeline that links Russia directly, under the sea, to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have together turned the wheel of the valve commanding the entry of Russian gas into the West European network.
With this new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe through a first tube of 1,224 km connecting the St Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube is due to be completed by the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third one on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge construction site looks like victory.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The Nord Stream will make it possible to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close it access to West European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream with a "new German-Soviet pact", with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is to say whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, since the project created a breach between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has been able, in just five years, to triumph over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich western countries, which are heavily gas-consuming, and whose deposits are in decline.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that links us organically," François Fillon confirmed by inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating how political and economic the major gas contracts are.
All this explains the broad smiles displayed by Gazprom's leaders, present in number in Lubmin, at the point of gas arrival.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-coated steel to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesperson for Nord Stream.
There has also been a need to increase measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel Towers, which nothing interrupts over its entire length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A monitoring platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project officials abandoned it while the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state corporation permanently established off their coasts.
"In case of damage, we stop the passage of gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have planned the welds to leak every 100,000 years.
Monitoring of the condition of the pipeline is carried out by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for outdoor observation, as well as by an aircraft circulating inside the pipeline.
From the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, one meter in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters second, he provides precise information on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without any repairs.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
It is 200 bars on departure, and 100 on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, who keeps 51% of the shares.
They were joined by the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire gas transmission capacity to the company for 20 renewable years.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the gas pipeline was provided by shareholders at 30% and by bank loans at 70%.
The total cost of the works is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to pay their own costs, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 metres high, form the gas outlet.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the coming gas before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskin, a brand book.
Created some fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskin wants to restore the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine book is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a off-white color, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskin notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is based on an old production technique, the mole skin (smack skin) which refers to a varnished cotton used to cover benches for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
"Moleskin has restored to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskin crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to draw up a sketch of the buyer, because the notebook seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskin, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, has almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from La Fnac to small downtown shops and has been able to impose her identity.
"We followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer covers... The brand is available on a range of supports.
A success that made envious: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskin's history.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of the disabled opens today.
Despite a proactive public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the entire population.
Disrupting?
"No," said Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable. "
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"However, much remains to be done."
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, there are still many obstacles before entering employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a university degree and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In short, all these criteria make it particularly difficult to return to employment and are "the crux of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Managing Director of Tremplin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
That's for the objective brakes.
Still the unspoken, the mentalities that are changing, of course, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité indicated that the managers interviewed had "a low level of knowledge of disability", with "over-representation of people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual disabilities".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the target of 6% employment of disabled workers set out in a law of 1987.
The latest available figures, which date from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Managing Director of the Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The proof: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, increasing from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "Que du bonheur"
Before facing the Blues Tuesday night (8:45 pm) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match gives them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the platform of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard did indeed make peace.
Five months after his attacker's gesture of humor against Turkey, the Belgian breeder has nothing but praise for him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to move forward," assures the Lillois.
As for the contrast between his performances in the club and in the selection, "it is a whole, he justified himself."
"In Lille, I am there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Hosted against Romania Friday night in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brilliant".
Without, however, omitting the notion of "pleasure".
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the successful campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a supporter," he says.
This, of course, contributes to further strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
Especially since opposite, "there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"We met earlier."
"To be able to play against them is nothing but happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens spoke of "fiery".
"Proud" to play "a gala game."
"Proud" also to note - as a "neighbour" - that France has "become a very high-level team" a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a great job," he said.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be well shared the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are getting big," he stressed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll find out in the next few matches." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Portugal of Paulo Bento starts with a lot of optimist its dam back against Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way out, both teams had lacked realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, of which he has been in control since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to break down.
In view of the game going (0-0), Friday in Zenica hell, it appears obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, but it was unable to score this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we haven't scored a goal on the outside."
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as hot, even if the party is obviously "very tight", says an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are quite convinced that we can take over," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chances of being at the Euro 2012", still relativized Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The draw reported Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw can be enough for Bosniaks, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we haven't scored a goal outside," says Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not give them time to think."
A good idea, provided you're realistic this time.
